        "date": "May 24, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for doing this interview with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> It\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> As Secretary of State, you chose Iran as your first major foreign policy speech. Why Iran? Is it because of the urgency or the importance of it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I think it\u2019s both. It\u2019s something that the President has viewed as a serious threat to Middle East stability and therefore to American national security and also looks at the place that the Iranian people find themselves, and he thinks it\u2019s a place America can help make a difference. He has long thought that the agreement that the previous administration entered into didn\u2019t serve any of those interests \u2013 the interests of the Iranian people or Middle East stability or, frankly, for America. And so it was a priority for him and thus I wanted in the first weeks since the Secretary of State to have an opportunity to lay out how President Trump thinks we can make things better in each of those three situations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What is the ultimate goal of the proposed new security framework, and how is it differ \u2013 how does it differ from the initial JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so very different. Different in breadth and I think different in its goal. The first agreement was very narrow. It was an effort to say that the Iranian regime was spending a ton of money on its nuclear program and it wanted to halt that \u2013 a noble objective, a good goal, a worthy one. But the threat that Iran presents is so much greater than that, right. They\u2019re taking \u2013 they\u2019re launching missiles into Muslim countries. They\u2019re taking the human rights away from their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these things I think President Trump cares deeply about, and so his vision is that if we begin again to set out what we think are pretty basic ideas, right. So these 12 things that I listed are all pretty straightforward. We\u2019re not asking a lot from the Iranian leadership, just behave like normal leaders; don\u2019t loot your people, don\u2019t waste your people\u2019s money on these adventures in Syria and Yemen and in Lebanon and in Iraq, the list goes on; lead your people, build a great nation, use the resources you have for that. That\u2019s all we\u2019re simply looking for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that going to be part of the new proposed security framework that Iran would stop or should stop meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so we\u2019ve asked for that. Look, we\u2019ve asked them to stop spreading terror around the world, not to build out militias in Iraq, not to put Iranian dollars and Iranian citizens, who are losing their lives in Syria \u2013 it\u2019s inappropriate for Middle East security and it\u2019s bad for the country. So our aim is to set conditions where Iran will behave like a normal nation, right. And if they do that, if they \u2013 and this is not the Iranian people. This is the Iranian leaders who have taken control and done this damage. If we can create conditions where they\u2019ll stop that, the Iranian people will have great success, and we will have Americans visiting there, and we\u2019ll have all the great things that we do when there are friends and allies as opposed to folks who are presenting risk to our country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I\u2019m going to get to the human rights issue also, sir. But if I may, I want to continue on the security framework if possible. How about a requirement for Iran to let inspections in the military sites? Is that going to be part of also the framework?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> So it is. With respect to the use of nuclear material in Iran, just as we have in Saudi Arabia, just as we did with the United Arab Emirates, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for Iran to have the capacity to create fissile material, to enrich uranium or have a plutonium facility. If they want a peaceful nuclear energy program, fine, but they could import that material. And other countries do it; it works for many countries around the world. And in order for us to achieve that, to get comfortable that that\u2019s the case, there will have to be inspections. That would include inspections at military sites and research laboratories and all the places that had been participants in previous iterations of Iran\u2019s program.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you mentioned human rights. There are protests, anti-government protests, all around Iran. I wanted to get your take on that. What do you \u2013 how do you feel about these protests? And do you think that United States can maybe support the protestors?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We can certainly provide moral support. I think importantly, the Iranian people will make these decisions for themselves. These protests have been ongoing now for months and months \u2013 some of them very small, some of them larger \u2013 often very much in sync with what I laid out this past week, their \u2013 how this wealth gets distributed to Qasem Soleimani and not the ordinary citizen in southeast Iran or in Tehran or wherever it might be. This wealth is being squandered so that ordinary Iranian citizens are both sending their young men off to fight and die and living lives that aren\u2019t as secure and as wealthy as they could be if Iran would simply change its behavior.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not about \u2013 you asked about regime change. It\u2019s not about changing the regime. It\u2019s about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people really want them to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it is what earlier John Bolton had said, that the goal of the administration is not regime change in Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> That\u2019s correct. Yes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And how do you feel about the opposition groups in the United States and in Europe? Do you support their efforts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yes. They should be \u2013 so long as they\u2019re working towards the same goal that we are. I\u2019ve seen from time to time that wasn\u2019t always the case with some of the groups, some of the smaller groups, frankly. So long as they\u2019re working towards the same thing. We don\u2019t want them advocating for regime change either. We want them working on behalf of the Iranian people, ordinary Iranian citizens who want nothing more than to live their lives, to be able to take their hijab off, to be able to go to work and raise their families and worship in the way they want to worship. This is for the Iranian people to do, and so if there are those on the outside who are working towards that goal, we certainly welcome it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, two years ago as a congressman you personally wanted to go to Iran, you were prepared to go to Iran, and you wanted to press the leadership \u2013 Khamenei and Zarif \u2013 to give you access to the American hostages. As Secretary, are you going to press the Iranian leadership again to free the American hostages? And as you know, Bob Levinson has disappeared more than 11 years ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I know the story of Mr. Levinson well. I pray for his safe return, and our team works for it every day. As for the other Americans, we hope that the Iranian leadership \u2013 Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, Ayatollah \u2013 all would see that it\u2019s in their best interests to \u2013 and for nothing more than basic humanity, to allow these innocent Americans to return to their families. There are big, big issues out there, but it seems pretty basic to me that one ought not hold innocent people from returning to their loved ones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo yes, we\u2019ll work on it. We\u2019ll pray for it. And we hope that one day, in the same way that we were blessed to have three Americans return from North Korea a few weeks past, we have that same kind of day for those that are being held by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I wanted to ask you about the chants, the slogans that we still hear inside Iran: \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d Before any type of agreement that Iran or Tehran and the United States would have about Iran, don\u2019t you think that it should be a requirement for Iran to stop that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, their leaders most especially. In America, people say all kinds of things. We have a wide-open democracy. There are people who like President Trump and who don\u2019t. I find that just fine. I am untroubled by that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen you have senior leaders, when you have others fomenting these sort of fake gatherings to do nothing but come after and talk \u2013 chant, \u201cDeath to America\u201d or \u201cDeath to Israel,\u201d the Iranian leadership ought to stop. They ought to stop that because it\u2019s not the right thing for their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think most Iranians \u2013 I think most Iranians look at what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish here in America and how blessed we\u2019ve been, and think that that\u2019s a model that works in the sense of we\u2019ll certainly adopt a different form of democracy, and we\u2019ll have a different form of government, and we\u2019ll have different values and beliefs across a certain set of things, we\u2019ll have different religions, and that \u2013 that\u2019s all fine. But the basic common understanding of humanity, that you treat every human being with dignity and respect, that you don\u2019t export violence around the world, that you don\u2019t steal and plunder from your people, those core values that are civilizational, they\u2019re historical \u2013 I think the Iranian people share those in the same way that the American people do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, I want to go back to something that you said, part of your speech. You stressed that \u2013 stressed, and you just mentioned it, that \u201cno more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats.\u201d What is your take on congressional efforts to expose the hidden wealth of the corrupt leaders of Iran, from Ayatollah Khamenei to the president? And if there is such a bill that would pass Congress, would the administration support this exposure?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We would. We think it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s just as important as an informational matter. The Iranian people deserve the truth. You have senior leaders that are pocketing money, using businesses that are nominally fronts, and frankly, just stealing. To the extent we can prove that and demonstrate that, I\u2019d welcome the chance to expose it so the Iranian people can judge for themselves whether these are the individuals they want to lead their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Thank you very much, ma\u2019am. It was great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We appreciate it very, very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

(Applause.) Welcome to the Heritage Foundation. My name is Kay James and I have the honor of being the president here. It is a pleasure and honor to welcome our distinguished guest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, back to Heritage. Yes, I said back. Some of you may remember that then-Congressman Pompeo spoke here on September 9th, 2015. His presence was appreciated, as his topic was timely. It was entitled \u201cA Pathway Forward: An Alternative to the Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal.\u201d And now we have the great pleasure of being with our friend in his new role as Secretary of State for the United States of America. It\u2019s not just a pleasure having him here; it\u2019s truly an honor that he chose Heritage as the site for his first public address as Secretary.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOur scholars here are dedicated to advancing individual freedom and national security, and his presence here is a wonderful affirmation of the positive impact that their work is having. And so to Secretary Pompeo, I\u2019d like to say thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, I imagine all who are in this room and watching online know a great deal about Secretary Pompeo, but please allow me to provide just a few highlights from his extraordinary career. Secretary Pompeo graduated first in his class at the United States military academy at West Point, and then served as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He also served with the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the U.S. Army\u2019s 4th Infantry Division. After leaving active duty, he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then had a successful private sector career, founding and serving as CEO of Thayer Aerospace and then becoming president of Sentry International.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo\u2019s public service began when he was elected representative of Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District, and his distinguished tenure on the Hill included service on the House Intelligence Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Select Benghazi Committee. Recognizing the Secretary\u2019s many talents, President Trump tapped him as director of the CIA, where he served from January 2017 to April 2018. And now, of course, he is our Secretary of State, having been sworn in just three and a half weeks ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast but, of course, never least, Secretary Pompeo is married to Susan Pompeo and has one son, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo, on behalf of the board of trustees, the staff, and all of the friends of the Heritage Foundation, welcome back to home. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the Heritage Foundation and its president, Kay Coles James. Thank you for hosting me today. First as a private citizen and then as a member of Congress, and even today, the Heritage Foundation has shaped my thinking on matters of the world and public policy issues. I\u2019m grateful for that excellent work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thanks for reminding me I can\u2019t talk about anything else but what we\u2019re talking about today. (Laughter.) Three years on. But it\u2019s an honor to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTwo weeks ago, President Trump terminated the United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump withdrew from the deal for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risk created by the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNo more. No more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats. No more acceptance of missiles landing in Riyadh and in the Golan Heights. No more cost-free expansions of Iranian power. No more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA put the world at risk because of its fatal flaws.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd they\u2019re worth recounting at some length today, if only for the purpose of ensuring that subsequent arrangements do not repeat them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, the weak sunset provisions of the JCPOA merely delayed the inevitable nuclear weapons capability of the Iranian regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfter the countdown clock ran out on the deal\u2019s sunset provisions, Iran would be free for a quick sprint to the bomb, setting off a potentially catastrophic arms race in the region. Indeed, the very brevity of the delay in the Iranian nuclear program itself incentivized Middle Eastern proliferation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMoreover, as we have seen from Israel\u2019s recent remarkable intelligence operation, Iran has lied for years about having had a nuclear weapons program. Iran entered into the JCPOA in bad faith. It is worth noting that even today, the regime continues to lie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told a Sunday morning news show, \u201cWe never wanted to produce a bomb.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis claim \u2013 this claim would be laughable if not for the willful deception behind it. Not only did the AMAD Program exist; the Iranians took great care \u2013 though, as we can see now, not enough care \u2013 to protect, hide, and preserve the work of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Mahabadi and his gang of nuclear scientists.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA had additional shortcomings as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal were simply not strong enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe deal did nothing to address Iran\u2019s continuing development of ballistic and cruise missiles, which could deliver nuclear warheads.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA permitted the Iranian regime to use the money from the JCPOA to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people, but the regime\u2019s leaders refused to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tInstead, the government spent its newfound treasure fueling proxy wars across the Middle East and lining the pockets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizballah, Hamas, and the Houthis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRemember: Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during the JCPOA. Qasem Soleimani has been playing with house money that has become blood money. Wealth created by the West has fueled his campaigns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrategically, the Obama administration made a bet that the deal would spur Iran to stop its rogue state actions and conform to international norms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat bet was a loser with massive repercussions for all of the people living in the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe idea of the JCPOA as a strategic pillar of stability in the Middle East was captured perfectly by John Kerry when he said, quote, \u201cI know the Middle East that is on fire \u2026 is going to be more manageable with this deal,\u201d end of quote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tQuery whether the Middle East is more manageable today than it was when they embarked on the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLebanon is an even more comfortable home for Hizballah today than it was when we embarked on the JCPOA. Hizballah is now armed to the teeth by Iran and has its sights set on Israel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to Iran, Hizballah provides the ground forces for the military expedition in Syria. The IRGC, too, has continued to pump thousands of fighters into Syria to prop up the murderous Assad regime and help make that country 71,000 square miles of kill zone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran perpetuates a conflict that has displaced more than 6 million Syrians inside the \u2013 6 million Syrians and caused over 5 million to seek refuge outside of its borders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese refugees include foreign fighters who have crossed into Europe and threatened terrorist attacks in those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, Iran sponsored Shia militia groups and terrorists to infiltrate and undermine the Iraqi Security Forces and jeopardize Iraq\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 all of this during the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Yemen, Iran\u2019s support for the Houthi militia fuels a conflict that continues to starve the Yemeni people and hold them under the threat of terror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe IRGC has also given Houthi missiles to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and to threaten international shipping in the Red Sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s support to the Taliban in the form of weapons and funding leads to further violence and hinders peace and stability for the Afghan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the Iranian Qods Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe should remember, too, that during the JCPOA Iran continues to hold Americans hostage: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and Bob Levinson, who has been missing for over 11 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI will note for the American people, you should know we are working diligently to bring each American missing wrongfully detained in Iran home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe list continues. Iran continues to be, during the JCPOA, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror. It continues to serve as sanctuary for al-Qaida, as it has done since 9/11, and remains unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members residing in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hizballah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaida? The United States believe you deserve better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have an additional point for the Iranian people to ponder. Here in the West, President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif are often held apart from the regime\u2019s unwise terrorist and malign behavior. They are treated somehow differently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe West says, \u201cBoy, if only they could control Ayatollah Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani then things would be great.\u201d Yet, Rouhani and Zarif are your elected leaders. Are they not the most responsible for your economic struggles? Are these two not responsible for wasting Iranian lives throughout the Middle East?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s worth the Iranian people considering, because instead of helping their own citizens, the regime continues to seek a corridor stretching from Iran\u2019s borders to the shores of the Mediterranean. Iran wants this corridor to transport fighters and an advanced weapons system to Israel\u2019s doorsteps. Indeed in recent months, the IRGC has flown an armed drone into Israeli airspace and launched salvos of rockets into the Golan Heights from Syria. Our steadfast ally has asserted the sovereign right of self-defense in response, a stance the United States will continue to unequivocally support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the bet \u2013 the bet that the JCPOA would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East, and indeed for the entire world. It is clear that the JCPOA has not ended Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, nor did it deter its quest for a regional hegemony. Iran\u2019s leaders saw the deal as the starting gun for the march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, the path forward. America\u2019s commitment to the Iran strategy President Trump laid down in October remains. It will now be executed outside of the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll continue to work with allies to counter the regime\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran\u2019s proliferation of missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten peace and stability. We will also ensure Iran has no path to a nuclear weapon \u2013 not now, not ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFollowing our withdrawal from the JCPOA, President Trump has asked me to achieve these goals on Iran. We\u2019ll pursue those goals along several lines of effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, we will apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime. The leaders in Tehran will have no doubt about our seriousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to our colleagues at the Department of Treasury, sanctions are going back in full effect and new ones are coming. Last week we imposed sanctions on the head of Iran\u2019s central bank and other entities that were funneling money to the IRGC Qods Force. They were also providing money to Hizballah and other terrorist organizations. The Iranian regime should know that this is just the beginning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis sting of sanctions will be painful if the regime does not change its course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen to one that rejoins the league of nations. These will indeed end up being the strongest sanctions in history when we are complete.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come in force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran will be forced to make a choice: either fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It will not have the resources to do both.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, I will work closely with the Department of Defense and our regional allies to deter Iranian aggression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe will ensure freedom of navigation on the waters in the region. We will work to prevent and counteract any Iranian malign cyber activity. We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hizballah proxies operating around the world and we will crush them. Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019d remind the leadership in Iran what President Trump said: If they restart their nuclear program, it will mean bigger problems \u2013 bigger problems than they\u2019d ever had before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, we will also advocate tirelessly for the Iranian people. The regime must improve how it treats its citizens. It must protect the human rights of every Iranian. It must cease wasting Iran\u2019s wealth abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe ask that our international partners continue to add their voice to ours in condemning Iran\u2019s treatment of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe protests \u2013 the protests of the past few months show that the Iranian people are deeply frustrated with their own government\u2019s failures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian economy is struggling as a result of bad Iranian decisions. Workers aren\u2019t getting paid, strikes are a daily occurrence, and the rial is plummeting. Youth unemployment is at a staggering 25 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGovernment mismanagement of Iran\u2019s natural resources has led to severe droughts and other environmental crises as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLook, these problems are compounded by enormous corruption inside of Iran, and the Iranian people can smell it. The protests last winter showed that many are angry at the regime that keeps for itself what the regime steals from its people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Iranians too are angry at a regime elite that commits hundreds of millions of dollars to military operations and terrorist groups abroad while the Iranian people cry out for a simple life with jobs and opportunity and with liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime\u2019s response to the protests has only exposed the country\u2019s leadership is running scared. Thousands have been jailed arbitrarily, and at least dozens have been killed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs seen from the hijab protests, the brutal men of the regime seem to be particularly terrified by Iranian women who are demanding their rights. As human beings with inherent dignity and inalienable rights, the women of Iran deserve the same freedoms that the men of Iran possess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut this is all on top of a well-documented terror and torture that the regime has inflicted for decades on those who dissent from the regime\u2019s ideology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime is going to ultimately have to look itself in the mirror. The Iranian people, especially its youth, are increasingly eager for economic, political, and social change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands with those longing for a country of economic opportunity, government transparency, fairness, and greater liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe hope, indeed we expect, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses and support \u2013 not suppress \u2013 the aspirations of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re open to new steps with not only our allies and partners, but with Iran as well. But only if Iran is willing to make major changes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs President Trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing, and able to negotiate a new deal. But the deal is not the objective. Our goal is to protect the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAny new agreement will make sure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and will deter the regime\u2019s malign behavior in a way that the JCPOA never could. We will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations, and we will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself. The Iranian wave of destruction in the region in just the last few years is proof that Iran\u2019s nuclear aspirations cannot be separated from the overall security picture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what should it be? We must begin to define what it is that we demand from Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, Iran must declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iran must also provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, each of them detained on spurious charges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must also end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring senior al-Qaida leaders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end the IRG Qods Force\u2019s support for terrorists and militant partners around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd too, Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors \u2013 many of whom are U.S. allies. This certainly includes its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also includes threats to international shipping and destructive \u2013 and destructive cyberattacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat list is pretty long, but if you take a look at it, these are 12 very basic requirements. The length of the list is simply a scope of the malign behavior of Iran. We didn\u2019t create the list, they did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom my conversations with European friends, I know that they broadly share these same views of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community. I ask that America\u2019s allies join us in calling for the Iranian Government to act more responsibly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn exchange for major changes in Iran, the United States is prepared to take actions which will benefit the Iranian people. These areas of action include a number of things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, once this is achieved, we\u2019re prepared to end the principal components of every one of our sanctions against the regime. We\u2019re happy at that point to re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relationships with Iran. And we\u2019re prepared to admit<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_edn1\" href=\"#_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Iran to have advanced technology. If Iran makes this fundamental strategic shift, we, too, are prepared to support the modernization and reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international economic system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut relief from our efforts will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran\u2019s policies. We acknowledge Iran\u2019s right to defend its people. But not its actions which jeopardize world\u2019s citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in contrast to the previous administration, we want to include Congress as a partner in this process. We want our efforts to have broad support with the American people and endure beyond the Trump Administration. A treaty would be our preferred way to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUnlike the JCPOA, which was broadly rejected across both sides of the aisle, an agreement that President Trump proposes would surely garner this type of widespread support from our elected leaders and the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the strategy we laid out today, we want the support of our most important allies and partners in the region and around the globe. Certainly our European friends, but much more than that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want the Australians, the Bahrainis, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Japanese, the Jordanians, the Kuwaitis, the Omanis, the Qataris, the Saudi Arabians, South Korea, the UAE, and many, many others worldwide to join in this effort against the Islamic Republic of Iran. I know that those countries share the same goals. They understand the challenge the same way that America does. Indeed, we welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation, and the brutality of a regime which is at odds with world peace, a country that continues to inflict chaos on innocent people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIndeed, while to some the changes in Iranian behavior we seek may seem unrealistic, we should recall that what we are pursuing was the global consensus before the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, in 2012, President Obama said, quote, \u201cThe deal we\u2019ll accept is [that] they end their nuclear program,\u201d end of quote. That didn\u2019t happen. In 2006, the P5 voted at the Security Council for Iran to immediately suspend all enrichment activities. That didn\u2019t happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2013, the French foreign minister said he was wary of being sucked into a, quote, \u201ccon game,\u201d end of quote, over allowing Iran to continue uranium enrichment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2015, John Kerry said, quote, \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize the right to enrich,\u201d end of quote. Yet the Iranians are enriching even as we sit here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re not asking anything other than that Iranian behavior be consistent with global norms, global norms widely recognized before the JCPOA. And we want to eliminate their capacity to threaten our world with those nuclear activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to its nuclear activities, why would we allow Iran more capability than we have permitted the United Arab Emirates and that we\u2019re asking for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? We understand that our reimposition of sanctions and the coming pressure campaign on the Iranian regime will pose financial and economic difficulties for a number of our friends. Indeed, it imposes economic challenges to America as well. These are markets our businesses would love to sell into as well. And we want to hear their concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account. Over the coming weeks, we will send teams of specialists to countries around the world to further explain administration policy, to discuss the implications of sanctions we imposition, and to listen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI know. I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time with our allies in my first three weeks. I know that they may decide to try and keep their old nuclear deal going with Tehran. That is certainly their decision to make. They know where we stand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNext year marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic \u2013 Revolution in Iran. At this milestone, we have to ask: What has the Iranian Revolution given to the Iranian people? The regime reaps a harvest of suffering and death in the Middle East at the expense of its own citizens. Iran\u2019s economy is stagnant and without direction and about to get worse. Its young people are withering under the weight of frustrated ambitions. They are longing to pursue the freedoms and opportunities of the 21st century.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran\u2019s leaders can change all of this if they choose to do so. Ali Khamenei has been supreme leader since 1989. He will not live forever, nor will the Iranian people abide the rigid rules of tyrants forever. For two generations, the Iranian regime has exacted a heavy toll on its own people and the world. The hard grip of repression is all that millions of Iranians have ever known.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow is the time for the supreme leader and the Iranian regime to summon the courage to do something historically beneficial for its own people, for this ancient and proud nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs for the United States, our eyes are clear as to the nature of this regime, but our ears are open to what may be possible. Unlike the previous administration, we are looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people, not just the regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf anyone, especially the leaders of Iran, doubts the President\u2019s sincerity or his vision, let them look at our diplomacy with North Korea. Our willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un underscores the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to diplomacy to help solve the greatest challenges, even with our staunchest adversaries. But that willingness, that willingness has been accompanied by a painful pressure campaign that reflects our commitment to resolve this challenge forever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo the ayatollah, to President Rouhani, and to other Iranian leaders: understand that your current activities will be met with steely resolve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy final message today is, in fact, to the Iranian people. I want to repeat President Trump\u2019s words from October. President Trump said that, \u201cWe stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime\u2019s longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. The Iranian people long to reclaim their country\u2019s proud history, its culture, its civilization, and its cooperation with its neighbors.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is America\u2019s hope that our labors toward peace and security will bear fruit for the long-suffering people of Iran. We long to see them prosper and flourish as in past decades and, indeed, as never before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the United States of America is proud to take a new course towards that objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES: </strong>Thank you so very much. Bold, concise, unambiguous. We appreciate you taking this forum here at the Heritage Foundation to deliver that message. Looking at \u2013 and you listed during your speech several of our allies and friends and partners, many of whom are angry, some disappointed. How are you going to bring them on board? How are you going to use your best diplomatic skills to bring them along with us?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> These strategic changes in the world come together when countries decide on an objective that is shared, and that always begins with a shared interest and values. I spent the first couple of weeks of my time as Secretary of State working to try to see if there wasn\u2019t a way to fix the deal. I spoke with my European counterparts. I traveled there. In my 13th hour as Secretary of State I was on the ground in Brussels speaking with my European counterparts. We couldn\u2019t get it done. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States intends to work hard at the diplomatic piece of working alongside all of our partners. We focus on the Europeans, but there are scores of countries around the world who share our concerns and are equally threatened by the Iranian regime. It\u2019s that shared interest, it\u2019s the value set which will ultimately drive, I believe, a global response to this \u2013 to the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror. I\u2019m convinced it can take place. My team is going to work diligently to do that. We\u2019re going to do so in the context of trying to address the concerns of all of our partners, and I am convinced that over a period of time there will be a broad recognition that the strategy that President Trump has laid out is the right one that will put Iran in a place where it will one day rejoin civilization in the way that we all hope that it will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> It\u2019s clear through your comments this morning that you truly want tough sanctions. And I think that there is some remaining concern about how are you going to deal with the nuclear concerns. Can you speak to that for just a bit? And let me say to our audience, by the way, that I wish we had more time with the Secretary this morning, and there will be an abrupt and a hard stop because we have to get him out to the CIA and \u2013 for the swearing-in ceremony, and we don\u2019t want you late for that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo talk to us about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I got to go back one more time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> One more time. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, the nuclear file is imperative. It presents the largest, most severe threat for sure. The JCPOA fell short. It was a delay. Our aim is to get that permanently fixed. I mentioned quickly, right, we ask our other Middle Eastern partners to do hard things. We put a 123 agreement in front of them and say, \u201cThis is what you have to do.\u201d And they say, \u201cHey, the Iranians enrich.\u201d That\u2019s reasonable. That seems to me a reasonable point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell, our demands on Iran aren\u2019t unreasonable. Give up your program. End it. Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we\u2019re fully prepared to respond to that as well. I\u2019m certainly not going to share with you today precisely what our response will be. But we watch them talk. We\u2019ve heard them say \u2013 I hope that they\u2019ll make a different decision, that they\u2019ll choose a different path. We welcome them taking a path that other nations in the region are beginning to take as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, can you explain for us the sanctions structure and how you intend to target the Iranian regime without hurting our European friends?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, any time sanctions are put in place, countries have to give up economic activity. So the Americans have given up economic activity now for an awfully long time, and I\u2019ll concede there are American companies who would love to do business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. There\u2019s a huge market there. It\u2019s a big, vibrant, wonderful peoples. But everyone is going to have to participate in this. Every country is going to have to understand that we cannot continue to create wealth for Qasem Soleimani.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRight, that\u2019s what this is. At the end of the day, this money has flowed to him. The economics have permitted them to run roughshod across the Middle East. Our effort is to strangle his economic capacity to do harm to the Middle East and to the world. Nuclear programs aren\u2019t cheap. To the extent we are effective at making it more difficult on the Iranian regime, we will reduce their capacity to continue to build out their nuclear weapon system as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> You\u2019ve laid out a very, very bold plan this morning. Do you have a timeframe for getting all this done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the sanctions are back in place and are winding down over the next 100 and what, 55 days? There are \u2013 there\u2019s lots more work in place. It is a effort across all of government. We are working certainly diplomatically in the lead, but Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, each of us has the same mission from President Trump. I can\u2019t put a timeline on it. But at the end of the day, the Iranian people will decide the timeline. At the end of the day, the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly, that would be wonderful. If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forward today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, Mr. Secretary, again, on behalf of the Heritage Foundation and the scholars here who have been working on these issues for a very long time, we want to thank you. Again, it was a bold vision \u2013 clear, concise, unambiguous \u2013 and we want to congratulate you and the President, and we wish you Godspeed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI am going to ask you to remain seated while the Secretary exits. I have about eight more questions here, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you all very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Thank you so much.

        "date": "May 18, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s on-the-record conference call with our director of policy planning, Brian Hook. It\u2019s certainly been a busy week with calls and outreach to our allies and partners in which we\u2019ve been discussing our next steps on Iran. Following this, Secretary Pompeo will deliver a speech on Monday to outline the administration\u2019s overall strategy to counter Iran\u2019s malign influence. Director Hook is here to speak with us today in advance of that speech.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a reminder, this briefing is on the record. It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. Brian has just about 10 minutes to take your questions, so I would encourage you to be brief. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Director Hook for some brief opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks, Heather. Good to be with all of you. Just make a few points here. The Secretary \u2013 Secretary Pompeo will be giving a speech on Monday. It will be his first major foreign policy address as Secretary of State. It will be a very timely address because it is presenting the way forward post the Iran nuclear deal withdrawal. And he\u2019ll be essentially presenting a diplomatic roadmap to achieve a new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal, following the President\u2019s decision to end America\u2019s participation in the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary has had very good phone calls with the ministers, the foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We have been working closely with the Europeans over the last week at various levels of government \u2013 the President, the Secretary of State. I\u2019ve been in touch with the political directors of the E3. We\u2019ve had staff discussion. So we have been in very extensive and deep consultations with the Europeans on the way forward. Our broad approach now that we\u2019ve been emphasizing is that we need a new \u2013 a framework that\u2019s going to address the totality of Iran\u2019s threats. And this involves a range of things around its nuclear program \u2013 missiles, proliferating missiles and missile technology, its support for terrorists, and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we see an opportunity to counter and address Iran\u2019s nuclear and proliferation threats, its destabilizing activity, and to create a better nonproliferation and deterrence architecture for Iran and the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\u2019s broadly the way forward. I\u2019m happy to take some questions. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday; that\u2019s only three days away from now. And he looks forward to presenting a comprehensive strategy toward Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll start with our first question. That\u2019s with Josh Lederman from the Associated Press. Hi, Josh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I just wanted to ask you about the prospects of getting other countries, and particularly the Europeans, to join any kind of coalition. I mean, the Europeans are moving ahead with using the blocking statute; they\u2019re even considering direct transfers to Iran\u2019s central bank. So what makes you think they\u2019re going to join you? And if you don\u2019t get the Europeans or actually any of the P5+1 on board, can this coalition still have enough weight to succeed in bringing Iran back to the table? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that we agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on. During the negotiations with the E3, we made a lot of progress not only \u2013 I mean, just on the nuclear piece, on the \u2013 on sunsets, on ICBMs, on a stronger inspections regime, but also on the regional activities, human rights, the range of missiles that are destabilizing the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we, I think, have the very \u2013 I think we assess the situation very similarly in terms of the wanting to take a comprehensive approach. When President Macron was in the United States he talked about the four pillars, and his \u2013 what he was talking about is a very comprehensive approach. And I think for the last many years, the last three years or so, the JCPOA gave a lot of people a sort of false sense of security that by addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, that we were somehow then addressing the totality of Iranian threats. And it\u2019s important that we \u2013 that we change that dynamic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think that, again, we agree on more than we disagree, and we, as I said, have been working with the Europeans over the last week or two, and just in consultations with them, and we want to continue the momentum from our work with our European allies. And we see this, the coming months, as an opportunity to expand our efforts and to work with a lot of countries who share the same concerns about nonproliferation, about terrorism, about stoking civil wars around the region, and so we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re very hopeful about the \u2013 about the diplomacy ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Brian. Next question, Michael Gordon from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Hi, Michael.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Hook, the diplomats in Europe that I\u2019ve spoken with have said that it\u2019s clear the administration wants tough sanctions, but the administration has yet to spell out in any detail what it \u2013 the arrangements that it thinks should be put in place now that the JCPOA has been scrapped. What specific nuclear constraints do you think are necessary post-JCPOA in the sphere of enrichment or other nuclear activities? And if you can\u2019t say what you want in terms of nuclear constraints, how can you ask the Europeans to impose tough sanctions? You\u2019re asking them to impose tough sanctions but you\u2019ve not defined your goal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think, Michael, that\u2019s part of the reason why the Secretary is giving a speech on Monday. But Brian, I\u2019ll let you take it from here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, that is \u2013 this is \u2013 as I said, this will be the Secretary\u2019s first major foreign policy address. He has decided to make that on Iran. And we will be discussing our vision to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has had a definite military dimension to it, and the Iranians have yet to come clean on the military dimensions of their nuclear activities. That is going to be part \u2013 I mean, obviously with what Israel disclosed recently, that Iran has been protecting and preserving a vast atomic archive while it has been implementing the JCPOA, and of course that increases the relevance of the sunsets. We don\u2019t believe that Iran has earned the trust of the world to have restrictions on its nuclear program lifted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Carol \u2013 sorry, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, go ahead, Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Carol Morello from <i>The Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing this. Say, Donald Tusk said some pretty strong things a couple of days ago about the administration. Basically, I think he said: With friends like this, who needs enemies? But at least we now know if you need a helping hand, you don\u2019t have to go farther than the end of your arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I was wondering what, if anything, that Secretary Pompeo will be doing to address the lingering resentment over Iran. I realize that\u2019s not the only issue, but that\u2019s certainly one. And also, if you could address a little bit of what kind of negotiation do you see with Iran. You seem to be seeking a surrender on their part, not a negotiation. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah. The President expressed his appreciation to our European partners. And we have worked, tried to fix the significant flaws in the nuclear deal to counter Iranian aggression. He believes very strongly in supporting the Iranian people. We believe that our shared values and commitment to confront sort of the common security challenges will transcend any disagreements over the JCPOA. And we weren\u2019t able to bridge all the gaps between our respective views on the JCPOA. We think that we\u2019ve been able to make a lot of progress on the range of issues on the nuclear and security sort of objectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture, a new framework, and I think that, again, people, I think, are overstating the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Brian, thanks. Lesley Wroughton from Reuters is next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, hi, Brian. I kind of want to come back to what the others are trying to say, because at a time when \u2013 a sensitive time when you\u2019re actually trying to get Iran to be part of discussions, it seems that you\u2019re pushing them away. How does one convince them through this new architecture that it\u2019s to their benefit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Well, you\u2019ve seen the protests in Iran, and you\u2019ve seen their dissatisfaction with \u2013 I think the Iranian people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime which have not helped the Iranian people. The President has spoken very eloquently about the concerns of the Iranian people. And so we \u2013 the President has said \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if it was the President said it or \u2013 but we have said that we are ready to negotiate a better deal, and there are a range of nations that can be a part of that. We certainly have the folks within the JCPOA, but we think there are other countries that also share these concerns, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, last question is Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. Hey, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Brian, do you have a timeframe for how long the U.S. would like this next round of negotiations to occur? At what point would the U.S. just say this is not going to happen? And can you also draw a parallel to North Korea? One of the things the administration has said about why North Korea came to the table was this maximum pressure campaign that left it so isolated diplomatically and economically. Do you believe that you could obtain the same scenario with Iran, that you would be able to create a similarly sort of airtight sanctions regime again with them?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK: </b>With the \u2013 by reimposing the sanctions that were lifted under the JCPOA, that will bring economic pressure to bear on Iran. It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago. We very much want a diplomatic outcome, one that is going to increase the security of the American people. We thought that the JCPOA provided too much in return for too little, and we also thought that it had very strong deficiencies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are going to be very focused on trying to achieve the President\u2019s national security objectives, and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions is part of our diplomatic strategy to try to achieve a better security architecture. And so the goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be discussing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe very much want to be \u2013 have a very kind of up-tempo diplomacy, one that\u2019s very focused and very determined to achieve our national security objectives. And Secretary Pompeo is committed to spending as much time as necessary with his team to achieve our goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, everyone, we have to wrap it up. Brian, thank you so much for your time. Everyone, thanks for calling in. We look forward to having as many of you join us for the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday. I believe we\u2019ll be sending out a formal announcement if we haven\u2019t already. So we look forward to talking with you. The embargo has now been lifted. And have a great weekend, everyone. Brian, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And joining us now, the new and very busy Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Good morning, Chris. It\u2019s great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let\u2019s start with breaking news. First of all, that savage attack last night in Paris, a Chechen knifing killing one person, wounding four others. What can you tell us about a possible link to terror?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, we don\u2019t know much more. We know that the caliphate ISIS has claimed responsibility. They said he was one of their soldiers. We can\u2019t verify that yet. The French authorities, with all the intelligence help the United States can provide, we\u2019ll do our best to unpack this in the coming hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s talk about some other breaking news. The North Koreans announced yesterday that they are going to blow up their nuclear site in 10 to 12 days. How big a development is this, and is that, do we believe, their only nuclear test site?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, it\u2019s good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world. And so this is one step along the way. I had a good set of meetings this past week aimed at heading in exactly this direction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to go back to the comment \u2013 and Kevin just played it \u2013 your comment on Friday that if Kim chooses the, quote, \u201cright path,\u201d the U.S. is prepared to work with North Korea to, quote, \u201cachieve prosperity.\u201d What does that mean in terms of direct U.S. investment in North Korea? And are we, as part of this, willing, in effect, to guarantee Kim\u2019s security, that regime change will be off the table?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, here\u2019s what this will look like. This will be Americans coming in \u2013 private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer \u2013 private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid \u2013 they need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. Those are the kind of things that, if we get what it is the President has demanded \u2013 the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea \u2013 that the American people will offer in spades.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And as part of that, are we, in effect, saying to Kim, \u201cIf you give us what we want, you can stay on in power?\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> We will have to provide security assurances to be sure. This has been a tradeoff that has been pending for 25 years. No president has ever put America in a position where the North Korean leadership thought that this was truly possible, that the Americans would actually do this, would lead to the place where America was no longer held at risk by the North Korean regime. That\u2019s the objectives. When I said earlier this week that I think Chairman Kim shares the objectives with the American people, I am convinced of that. Now the task is for President Trump and he to meet to validate the process by which this would go forward, to set out those markers so that we can negotiate this outcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any problem, given Kim\u2019s history and the history of his family as an oppressive regime, any problems with the idea of the U.S., even if we get our deal, in effect, giving a security guarantee to the Kim regime?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, we\u2019ll have to see how the negotiations proceed, but make no mistake about it: America\u2019s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or into the very place we\u2019re sitting here this morning, Chris. That\u2019s our objective, that\u2019s the end state the President has laid out, and that\u2019s the mission that he sent me on this past week to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about denuclearization, the objective. Two weeks ago, National Security Advisor John Bolton sat in this very seat, and he told me that the U.S. negotiating position going in is that Kim has to ship out, has to dismantle and take out of the country all of his nuclear weapons, all of his nuclear infrastructure, all of his long-range missiles before the U.S. will grant any concessions. On the other hand, this week, Kim met with Chinese President Xi and he called for, quote, \u201cphased and synchronous measures,\u201d in other words, action for action. Have you and Kim agreed what the sequencing is? Is it all of the actions by him first, or is it step by step? And is that something, as I say, that you\u2019ve agreed with, or is it something that Kim and the President will have to work out at the summit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, we\u2019ve had discussions on how this would proceed. There\u2019s still a great deal of detail to be worked on, and in the coming weeks we will continue to work on that so that we can be in a good spot on June 12th in Singapore for President Trump. But make no mistake about it: We\u2019ve done this before, right? We\u2019ve done trade for trade, moment for moment; you give me X, I give you Y; and it has failed repeatedly. I think Chairman Kim understands that. I think he appreciates the fact that this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before. If we\u2019re going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take truly historic measures to achieve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And how confident are you? Because you\u2019re going to be putting the President of the United States in a room with Kim in Singapore with the whole world watching. How confident are you that not only he understands it, but that he\u2019s going to have to \u2013 that he\u2019s going to deliver on our expectations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, to quote President Trump, we\u2019ll see, right? We are not to the place yet where we should be remotely close to declaring that we have achieved what it is we want. There\u2019s a great deal of work that remains. Our eyes are wide open with respect to the risks. But it is our fervent hope that Chairman Kim wants to make a strategic change, a strategic change in the direction for his country and his people; and if he\u2019s prepared to do that, President Trump is prepared to assure that this could be a successful transition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right, I want to talk about that. You\u2019ve said that we understand, and John Bolton talked about that nobody in the administration is starry-eyed. The President has been raising expectations for the summit, saying he thinks that they\u2019re going to make a great deal \u2013 his phrase. Your predecessor at the CIA, John Brennan, says he thinks that\u2019s playing into Kim\u2019s hands. Take a look:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP: \u201c</strong>I think that we\u2019re going to have a success. I think this will be a very big success.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>MR BRENNAN:</strong> \u201cI think he has been masterful in how he has manipulated perceptions and how he has manipulated and, quite frankly, duped Mr. Trump.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it a mistake for the President to predict a, quote, \u201cgreat success\u201d?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I think Former Director Brennan\u2019s remarks are silly on their face. We\u2019re going to enter into a set of discussions with two nations doing their best to achieve outcomes for their own people that are consistent with their objectives and goals. I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives, and our mission is to prepare the groundwork. And we\u2019re pretty far along the way in doing so, and we\u2019ll continue to work in the days ahead \u2013 30 left \u2013 to prepare for June 12th so the President can have a successful outcome, that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> After you brought the American hostages home and the whole world celebrated that, President Trump praised Kim for releasing them. And that praise \u2013 not the release of the hostages, but that praise \u2013 upset some critics. Take a look at this:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP:</strong> \u201cKim Jong-un did a great service to himself, to his country, by doing this.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>SENATOR SCHUMER:</strong> \u201cWe can\u2019t be fooled into giving the North Korean regime credit for returning Americans that never should have been detained in the first place.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> According to your State Department\u2019s latest report, North Korea still holds at least 80,000 political prisoners in its labor camps and other facilities. Is human rights an issue in this summit, or is this just going to be about the nuclear issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yeah, Chris, this administration is always concerned about human rights. It\u2019s the case not only are there political prisoners that remain in North Korea, there are Americans held around the world by other rogue regimes too. I can assure you this administration \u2013 I saw it in my role as director of the CIA and I\u2019ve seen it now in my first two and a half weeks as Secretary of State \u2013 is intently focused on achieving the return of each of those as well. We had a success this week. We\u2019re happy for those families and for America that those three Americans returned home, but we recognize there\u2019s much work to do. We still have Americans held and we\u2019re working diligently on behalf of each and every one of them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> When people found out that you were going to be on the program today they all had the same question. I must say I did. What is Kim like? With the possible exception of Dennis Rodman, you have spent more time with him than any other Westerner, at least two and a half hours the way I figure it. What is he like? Give us any kind of personal insight. How aware is he of what President Trump has been saying? Was there any mention of Little Rocket Man?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve got a lot fewer rebounds than Dennis Rodman, but I did get to spend a great deal of time with Chairman Kim. The conversations are professional. He knows \u2013 he knows his brief. He knows what the \u2013 what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHe does follow the Western press. He\u2019ll probably watch this show at some point. He\u2019s paying attention to things that the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team will be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u2019s just possible we might pull off a historic undertaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was there any mention of the exchange of insults back and forth?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No, we didn\u2019t cover that, Chris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> That\u2019s probably wise. (Laughter.) I want to turn to \u2013 there\u2019s a lot on your brief. Iran and Israel got into an armed conflict across the Syrian border this week after President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. Do you think that there\u2019s any connection that Iran feels less constrained now that the U.S. no longer is part of this deal about Iran nukes?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s ludicrous. That\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that Iran feels less constrained when during the JCPOA they have now fired missiles into an airport where Americans travel each day in Riyadh, they\u2019ve now fired missiles into Israel; to suggest that somehow the withdrawal from the JCPOA is driving the Iranian conduct that\u2019s taken place during the JCPOA in Yemen, the rise of Hizballah \u2013 all of those things took place during the JCPOA. Indeed, I would argue that they felt they could act with impunity. They watched. They watched Europe put exactly zero sanctions on their missile program during the JCPOA. I think Rouhani and Zarif need to explain why it\u2019s the case that while this agreement was in place Iran continued its march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> President Trump made it clear that he\u2019s not only going after Iran but he\u2019s also prepared to sanction European companies that continue to do business in Tehran. Here is the President: \u201cWe will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the leaders of France, of Germany, of Britain all say that they\u2019re going to stay in the deal and they\u2019re going to look for a way to protect European companies that continue to do business. The question is: How hard is the Trump administration prepared to go after European companies that ignore the U.S. pulling out?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Two things, Chris. First, the wealth that was created in Iran as a result of the JCPOA drove Iranian malign activity. It fueled Qasem Soleimani. It fueled the IRGC. It provided resources for their work in Syria and Iraq. President Trump\u2019s withdrawal is aimed at denying them that wealth, denying them the resources to continue their bad behavior, to take the money away from them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe withdrawal wasn\u2019t aimed at the Europeans. I worked hard over the short time I\u2019ve been the Secretary of State to try and fix the deal. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement with our E3 partners. I am hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works, that really protects the world from Iranian bad behavior, not just their nuclear program but their missiles and their malign behavior as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> And I\u2019ll be working closely with the Europeans to try and achieve that, Chris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what about if the European companies and the European countries say look, there\u2019s not going to be a renegotiation any more than there\u2019s going to be a renegotiation of the Paris Climate Accord? Is the U.S. prepared to go after companies in our allies like Britain, France, and Germany, if they try to continue to do business?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> The sanctions regime that is now in place is very clear about what the requirements are. My mission that I\u2019ve been given by President Trump is to work to strike a deal that achieves the outcomes that protect America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, and I\u2019ll be hard at it with the Europeans in the next several days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> A couple of final questions. Israel. The U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem tomorrow. The Palestinians are talking about a day of rage, violent mass protests, and the PLO won\u2019t even talk to the U.S. anymore as an interlocutor in terms of the Middle East. Is the peace process dead? And given the threat of violence, what are you as the Secretary of State saying to Americans in the Middle East in those parts of the world over the next few days?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the peace process is most decidedly not dead. We\u2019re hard at work on it. We hope we can achieve a successful outcome there as well. With respect to security, we are aware of the situation on the ground. The United States Government has taken a number of actions to ensure that not only our governmental interests but the American people in that region are secure as well, and we\u2019re comfortable we\u2019ve taken action that reduces that risk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Finally \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty remarkable given all that\u2019s happened, all that\u2019s on your brief \u2013 you have been Secretary of State for barely two weeks now. What\u2019s your vision for the State Department?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, first, Chris, I hope I haven\u2019t peaked in my first two weeks. (Laughter.) But it\u2019s pretty clear: We\u2019ve got to go put the diplomatic team on the playing field. It should be the United States State Department that is at the front of American foreign policy, delivering solutions to solve America\u2019s problems without resort to military force. And so I\u2019m going to build the team, we\u2019re going to get our swagger back, and the State Department will be out in front in every corner of the world leading America\u2019s diplomatic policy, achieving great outcomes on behalf of President Trump and America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secretary Pompeo, thank you. Thanks for your time in a very busy schedule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Always good to talk with you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you, Chris.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here in Toronto for the G7 ministerial meeting. Toronto is a beautiful city (inaudible) and lovely weather, beautiful facilities here at the university. Very grateful for our hosts here. The Government of Canada and Foreign Minister Freeland has put together a terrific program for us. So on behalf of the United States and President Trump, I want to extend our sincerest appreciation to Canada and to Prime Minister Trudeau and Foreign Minister Freeland for their active leadership of the G7.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States wholeheartedly supports the emphasis of our Canadian host on building a more peaceful and secure world for all. We also applaud Canada\u2019s efforts to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through strategic partnerships that seek to tackle challenges faced by women across the globe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur conversations over the past few days have been very productive, and the U.S. remains committed to working closely with our G7 partners on all of the critical issues that we discussed, and we look forward to our leaders building upon our conversations when they gather in Charlevoix in June for the G7 leaders\u2019 conference.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmong the number of shared priorities discussed is our collective commitment to counter transnational terrorists and the criminal networks supporting them. While we have made significant gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in cyberspace and in other countries, we cannot stand idly by and assume that it is defeated. We must remain vigilant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also remain united in opposition to the DPRK\u2019s continued development of unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs. We call for all countries around the world to take action and reinforce this message to Pyongyang and to rigorously enforce the UN Security Council resolutions. International unity is essential as we continue to push diplomatic and economic pressure until the DPRK concedes to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe G7 countries reaffirm our message to Iran to adhere to international norms and strictly abide by its nuclear-rated \u2013 nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. The United States calls on all of our partners to continue working alongside us as we counter Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and hold the Iranian Government accountable for their actions: supporting terrorist organizations, launching cyber attacks, threatening international shipping interests, and committing unconscionable human rights abuses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSyria was another prominent topic of discussion. On April 13th, the United States, France, and the UK launched strikes on three targets in Syria. These military actions taken together with our allies were a response to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons to kill and injure hundreds of its own people. The images of dead and dying children following the Syrian regime\u2019s most recent chemical attack represented a call to action among the world\u2019s civilized nations. The response of the United States and our key partners was not simply to hold Assad and other Syrian regime officials accountable for the atrocities committed, but also to degrade the regime\u2019s capability to commit them and to deter the use of chemical weapons in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe want to ensure that malicious regimes and terrorists understand this message of deterrence. We\u2019re committed to completing the fight against ISIS and rooting out its remaining havens. The U.S. will remain committed in Syria until ISIS is defeated and the so-called caliphate completely eliminated. We will work to ensure local\u00a0forces enabled by our regional partners and allies will consolidate these gains, stabilize liberated territories, and prevent the return of ISIS. We will not leave a vacuum that can be exploited by the Assad regime and its supporters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn parallel, we will work with our partners to invigorate the Geneva political process pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and to mobilize the resources needed to address Syria\u2019s urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs. We will seek further contributions in forces, materiel, and money from regional partners and allies in order to sustain the effort in Syria and stabilize liberated territories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we work to advance the political process, the United States is committed to ensuring that all Syrians, including the Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians, Turkmen, and other minorities in northeast Syria, have a full seat at the table and an appropriate say in their future pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe G7 countries agree that Russia must stop creating impediments to peace and abide by the commitments it entered into under UN Security Council Resolution 2401 and compel the Assad regime to do the same. Russia must be a constructive partner in Syria or will be held accountable. We also stand united in our commitment to hold Russia accountable for its activities in Ukraine. Together, the G7 call on Russia to honor its Minsk commitments, to de-escalate violence, and to return control of Crimea to Ukraine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the issues of collective concern I\u2019ve just outlined, over the past few days we also discussed our solidarity on Venezuela, Libya, and many other critical issues on the forefront of the international agenda, including the humanitarian crisis in Burma. Nearly 700,000 people, mostly Rohingya women and children, have fled violence in Burma since August, bringing the total number of refugees hosted in Bangladesh to approximately one million.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn response to this dire situation, I am announcing today that we are providing an additional $50 million in humanitarian assistance from our Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration to support a UN-led joint response plan in Bangladesh. This brings the United States response to the Rakhine State crisis in Burma and Bangladesh to more than $163 million since August 2017 and total humanitarian assistance for displaced people in and from Burma to more than $255 million since October 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis assistance will support refugees in Bangladeshi host communities to provide protection, emergency shelter, water, sanitation, health care, and psychological support for people affected by the conflict, as well as to prepare for the impending monsoon and cyclone season, which has the potential to bring significant loss of life, shelter, and access to critical services. We urge other donors to join us in providing additional humanitarian assistance for those affected by this crisis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith those observations on the topics we\u2019ve covered here at the G7 ministerial meeting, I look forward to taking your questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. And with that, we\u2019ll start with Dave Clark from AFP. Dave, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you. Thank you very much. You mentioned in your comments that the G7 members agreed on the importance of holding Iran to its commitments under the JCPOA. Were you able to give a commitment to your allies here that the United States will live up to its commitments under the JCPOA, and in particular to maintain the sanctions waiver on the nuclear-related sanctions after May the 12th? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Thank you. Well, as you know, this has been a topic of discussion with our E3 partners. The United States has significant concerns with Iran and its ballistic missiles program, its destabilizing and malign influence in the region \u2013 in Yemen, in Syria, and elsewhere \u2013 and concerns we have with the JCPOA itself, including its sunset clauses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump is concerned, very concerned, about Iran\u2019s behavior, malign behavior. His ultimate concern with the JCPOA is the concern for nonproliferation. We \u2013 no one wants to see a nuclear-armed Iran. President Trump\u2019s goal in this entire process is to strengthen the JCPOA if it can be strengthened and to protect America and American interests which have been threatened for over 40 years by the regime in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve lived through my family with. My uncle was the last U.S. ambassador to Iran. He left Tehran \u2013 fortunately for him and my family \u2013 in the summer of 1979 before his staff was taken hostage on November 4th, 1979 and held in violation of all international norms and basic, basic human dignity, for 444 days by that regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re well aware of the problems and the destabilizing and malign influence of Iran, and the President is committed to addressing it. We have discussed that at length with our partners here at the G7 ministerial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you. And our next question goes to Mike Blanchfield from the Canadian Press. Hi, Mike.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Mr. Secretary, we heard earlier today from Boris Johnson and Chrystia Freeland on the G7 efforts on \u2013 to call out Russia for its interference in democratic institutions. They\u2019ve talked about a working group that is going to report to the leaders and going to urge them to speak out against the influence of Russia. Russia is a politically charged topic in your country, obviously, especially with the Mueller investigation. How \u2013 how committed is your government to this G7 endeavor, and how likely is it that we\u2019ll see President Trump here in Charlevoix standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these G8 \u2013 the G7 leaders in calling out Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Well, you made a reference there \u2013 you caught yourself when referring to the G8. It\u2019s no longer the G8 for a reason. It\u2019s the G7. We\u2019re committed to addressing all of the abhorrent behavior that we have witnessed particularly recently by Russia, whether it\u2019s at Salisbury, its support for the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has not just undertaken with its \u2013 with its allies and partners in the G7 to make statements about this behavior; we have undertaken significant actions in response. As you know, we expelled a large number of undeclared Russian intelligence agents from the United States, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian oligarchs and Russian institutions, enterprises. So we have taken action. We stand with our G7 allies in confronting Russian malign behavior where \u2013 wherever we see it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, we also want to work with Russia in areas where we can and need to work with Russia, whether it\u2019s on stability, New START talks, INF Treaty \u2013 treaty violation, actually, by the Russians which we need to \u2013 need to address, counterterrorism. There are any number of areas where we still need to have a dialogue with Russia, but that will not prevent us from standing up and confronting and taking action against Russian behavior that\u2019s contrary to international norms and all that we stand for in the G7. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Sir, thank you. Thank you, everyone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for coming, especially on a Friday. Today the State Department released the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Promoting freedom \u2013 promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms are central to who we are as a country, and the United States will continue to support those around the world struggling for human dignity and liberty.\n\n\n<p>\n\tThis is the 42nd annual Human Rights Report that the department has now released. We\u2019re delighted to have our Acting Secretary of State, John Sullivan, with us here today to say a few words about this report. After Acting Secretary Sullivan\u2019s remarks, we will invite Ambassador Michael Kozak to the podium to answer some of your questions. I will help facilitate, as we all know one another, and assist with that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak is a senior bureau official with the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and he\u2019s looking forward to speaking with you shortly. He has served this department under Republican and Democrat administrations for 46 years, which is incredible. Sir, thank you for your service to the State Department.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will hand over the podium to our Acting Secretary John Sullivan. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN: </strong>Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s an honor to be here to formally release the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Now in their 42nd year, these reports are a natural outgrowth of our values as Americans. The founding documents of our country speak to unalienable rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law \u2013 revolutionary concepts at the time of our founding that are now woven into the fabric of America and its interests both at home and abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPromoting human rights and the idea that every person has inherent dignity is a core element of this administration\u2019s foreign policy. It also strengthens U.S. national security by fostering greater peace, stability, and prosperity around the world. The Human Rights Reports are the most comprehensive and factual accounting of the global state of human rights. They help our government and others formulate policies and encourage both friends and foes to respect the dignity of all individuals without discrimination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, we have sharpened the focus of the report to be more responsive to statutory reporting requirements and more focused on government action or inaction with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights. For example, each executive summary includes a paragraph to note the most egregious abuses that occurred in a particular country, including those against women, LGBTI persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous persons, and members of religious minorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBefore I turn the podium over to Mike, I\u2019d like to discuss a few countries in particular, including some with the most egregious human rights records.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe entire world is aware of the horrendous human rights abuses in Syria, including barrel bombing of civilians, attacks on hospitals, widespread reports of rape and abuse by Syrian Government personnel. A week ago, the President took action, together with our French and British allies, to deter the use of chemical weapons and protect the human rights of Syrian civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe condemn the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Burma and the atrocities committed against them, and we are working with partners to address that crisis. More than 670,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in recent months. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been internally displaced. Those responsible for the violations, abuses, and attacks must be held accountable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe DPRK is one of the most repressive and abusive regimes in the world. As the report makes clear, the Kim regime systematically neglects the well-being of its people to underwrite and fund its illicit weapons programs via forced labor, child labor, and the export of North Korean workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina continues to spread the worst features of its authoritarian system, including restrictions on activists, civil society, freedom of expression, and the use of arbitrary surveillance. The absence of an independent judiciary, the government\u2019s crackdown in independent lawyers, and tight controls on information undermine the rule of law. We\u2019re particularly concerned about the efforts of Chinese authorities to eliminate the religious, linguistic, and cultural identities of Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists, as well as restrictions on the worship of Christians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian people continue to suffer at the hands of their leaders. The right of peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression are the legitimate expectation of all individuals worldwide. Unfortunately for the Iranian people, these human rights are under attack almost daily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Turkey, the detention of tens of thousands of individuals, including journalists and academics, under an ongoing state of emergency has undermined the rule of law there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Venezuela, the Maduro regime represses the human rights of its people and denies them the right to have a voice in their government. Thousands flee their homes daily in response to this growing humanitarian crisis. At the Summit of the Americas last week, Vice President Pence announced $16 million in humanitarian aid from the United States to help those who have fled Venezuela, are in \u2013 and are in desperate need of food, water, and medical help. We stand by the Venezuelan people even as their leaders refuse to allow aid into the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, the Russian Government continues to quash dissent and civil society, even while it invades its neighbors and undermines the sovereignty of Western nations. We once again urge Russia to end its brutal occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, to halt the abuses perpetrated by Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and to address impunity for the human rights violations and abuses in the Republic of Chechnya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat\u2019s a brief overview of the factual reports on countries of most concern. I know that Ambassador Kozak will be happy to answer any questions you may have, but before I turn the podium over to him, let me note at least a few bright spots.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUzbekistan \u2013 although there\u2019s still much progress to be made, the country has pursued a strategic reform agenda with positive effects on human rights, including the release of eight high-profile prisoners last year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Liberia, the recent presidential election represents a milestone marking the first peaceful transition from one democratically elected leader to another in more than 70 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Mexico, the general law on forced disappearances established criminal penalties for persons convicted of forced disappearance and a national framework to find victims.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese represent a few of the more positive examples noted in the reports which are released today. We hope to see many more positive accounts of countries taking serious action to improve the human rights record in the reports next year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn conclusion, let me say America leads the way globally to promote human rights. We will also continue to impose consequences on those who abuse human rights. Over the past year, through the Russia Magnitsky and Global Magnitsky sanctions programs, we have undertaken some of our most aggressive measures yet. No human rights abuser, no matter where in the world, is out of our reach. The Human Rights Reports are a significant part of that overall effort. Creating them is an enormous undertaking and not for the fainthearted. I\u2019m grateful to so many of my colleagues in the State Department, including those here in Washington and many others in embassies and consulates around the world, who\u2019ve made these reports possible and contribute to America\u2019s longstanding leadership in promoting human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019d like to turn the podium over to Acting Under Secretary Nauert and to my friend and colleague, Ambassador Mike Kozak. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I realize that this report doesn\u2019t cover the United States and \u2013 but in this preface and in his comments just now, Acting Secretary Sullivan talked about how the U.S. is promoting \u2013 promotes and defends rights, and that that\u2019s central to us as a country, and that the United States will lead other nations by example in promoting rule of law and respect for human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering how effective you think that you can be in leading by example when you take \u2013 you accuse numerous \u2013 there \u2013 a lot of countries of, say, assaults on press freedom when here, in this country, we have a President who routinely excoriates the press, calling individual media outlets \u2013 and individual reporters sometimes \u2013 fake news. I\u2019m wondering how you can criticize countries for discrimination against LGBT people when this administration\u2019s stated policy is to exclude transgender people from serving in the military. I\u2019m wondering about discrimination of \u2013 criticism of other countries for discriminating against religious minorities when courts and a lot of critics see the travel ban as, in fact, a ban on one particular religion. And lastly, you criticize countries for the mistreatment and refoulement of refugees, which I suppose this administration is not in that great of a position to do because it doesn\u2019t accept hardly any refugees, or at least far fewer than it ever did before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how is this not \u2013 how do you not open yourself up to charges of hypocrisy, and how effective do you think you can be at leading by example? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s see if I can remember each one of those. But I think as you go through the report, you\u2019ll see the countries that we criticize for limiting press freedom, it\u2019s for things like having criminal libel laws where you can be put in jail for what you say. It\u2019s for things like yanking the licenses of media outlets you don\u2019t like or, in many cases, killing the journalists. So I think we make quite a distinction between political leaders being able to speak out and say that that story was not accurate or using even stronger words sometimes, and using state power to prevent the journalists from continuing to do their work. So I think there\u2019s an example there, and we\u2019ve used that with many of our colleagues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe other end of your stream was refoulement, which is a legal term. It\u2019s sending somebody back to a place where they are \u2013 where you know they\u2019re going to be persecuted or where they have a well-founded fear of persecution without going through due process to assess the risk to them. And of course, our law provides that people have rights of appeal through the immigration courts system and into the federal courts if they think they\u2019re going to be. So it doesn\u2019t go to the quantity of refugees; it goes to whether you\u2019re --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, I understand. But you\u2019re not in a position if you even wanted to refoule a refugee, you don\u2019t have many to do it to. But it\u2019s also mistreatment of refugees. It\u2019s not just that. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah, and that usually involves, as you\u2019ll find documented in many countries in the report, physical mistreatment of refugees and that kind of thing. Your --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> LGBT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> LGBT. As we are very clear in the reports, and this has been U.S. policy for some time, the things we\u2019re focused on are is: Has the government in question criminalized same-sex sexual activity, and that\u2019s highlighted now right up front in the reports; have they failed to prevent violence against people because of their LGBT status, or the same applies to ethnic groups and religious and so on; and then, third, discrimination in housing, employment, and government services. Usually, military and police are a slightly different form of government employment. So you can have a debate about that one, but most of the other countries where we\u2019re criticizing them, I think we would be very happy if they were following the procedures we are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of policy decisions in these areas that governments make that aren\u2019t internationally recognized human rights, so that\u2019s where we try to distinguish. And that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s nothing new. That\u2019s been the case in the last couple of administrations as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michelle from CNN.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I\u2019d like to know if you think that such statements in the United States weaken the impact of this report, because the American President has called the press an enemy of the people. And I think at one point he called for a closer look at libel laws or something like that. Do you think in the eyes of people that are looking at this report, as an example and as a resource, do statements like that currently weaken its impact?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think the report is very clear about the kinds of things that we consider to be inappropriate restrictions on freedom of the media \u2013 as I mentioned, using the legal system to go after members of the press, using physical force and so on. It doesn\u2019t go to the nature of discourse in a country. And you can have your own judgments as to how \u2013 how strong a statement might or might not be, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have a hard time explaining that in a lot of places. When you talk to some of my friends in Cuba, for example, who try to be independent journalists there and are routinely slapped around, they also get called names, but they \u2013 I think if it were limited to that they\u2019d be pretty happy as compared to the situation now. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when the State Department is talking about this represents our values as Americans, the removal of sections on women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 why is that not included in values as Americans?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> There\u2019s still a long section on women. And by the way, if you look elsewhere in the report, I mean, women are also activists, are also journalists. There are \u2013 yeah, now --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Understood. But it\u2019s so conspicuous that it\u2019s removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Let me \u2013 now, it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to explain why it was removed. It was introduced six years ago into the report. It hadn\u2019t been there before. The \u2013 it\u2019s one of the few terms that are used in the report that isn\u2019t derived from an international treaty that has a definition or derived from U.S. law, where there\u2019s a clear definition to the term.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in this case, the previous administration intended it to mean look at the availability of contraception, at the \u2013 whether the government tried to impose or coerce people in making decisions about reproduction. In the statements that were made \u2013 this was derived from the Beijing Declaration that was done in the \u201890s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt that time, it was very clear and our delegation made a very clear statement that this has nothing to do with abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion. Unfortunately, over the last few years, groups on both sides of that issue domestically have started to use the term, and both seem to think it does include abortion and then argue about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo our thought was let\u2019s just not use a term that has the opposite meaning from the one we intend. We went back to the term that\u2019s used in the U.S. statute that requires the Human Rights Report, which is coerced family planning, namely coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI might mention too, because I went back and looked at last year\u2019s report, the question being asked was, \u201cWere there obstacles opposed to getting contraception information and means?\u201d The answer in virtually every country was no, there were no obstacles other than, in almost every country, including our own, the availability in rural areas is less than it is in urban areas. But we were taking a lot of space to explain that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve kept that information in there. We\u2019ve done it now by a hyperlink. We used to take that information from the WHO report and put it in. We said let\u2019s just use a hyperlink, and then there\u2019s actually more information available that way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the rationale behind that. It\u2019s not a diminishment of women\u2019s rights or a desire to get away from it; it was to stop using a term that has several different meanings that are not all the ones we intend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Dave Clark from AFP.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you very much. When countries around the world are looking at the U.S. for leadership on human rights, should they be looking at this report, or should they be looking at President Trump\u2019s embrace of Rodrigo Duterte, of meeting with Sisi, and with the very warm relations with Mohammed bin Salman, who runs a country where women have no rights at all? Is \u2013 what sends the stronger signal, the President\u2019s close personal friendship with Xi Jinping and his golf tours at Mar-a-Lago or you at that podium decrying human rights abuses?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, this is a official report, and by the way, I think it\u2019s one of the most widely read U.S. Government documents in the world when we do the hit counts on the internet. It\u2019s put out in the name of the Secretary of State, who was just here to deliver it, and he certainly is reflecting the President in this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think this is showing what we assess to be the human rights situation in all of the countries you\u2019ve just mentioned, including \u2013 now even more so \u2013 the responsibility of the government for the abuses that are occurring there. They\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not just saying there are these societal problems in the country; we\u2019re saying the government either has done these bad deeds or not. And I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Russia we highlighted the fact \u2013 their response to an increase in domestic violence there \u2013 and they have a terrible problem, I mean tens of thousands of deaths of women being killed in domestic disputes every year. But since it went up, the government spokesman who went into the State Duma said, \u201cWell, we have to decriminalize this, because it\u2019s better that our women be beaten than that our men be humiliated by their behavior.\u201d So \u2013 and this was Putin\u2019s party, they decriminalized spousal beating. So not a very good thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, does that mean that the President should never speak to these people? This is what \u2013 we\u2019re trying to keep the report as the factual baseline for what we\u2019re going to do in policy terms or sanctions as the secretary was mentioning. So we can learn a lot from this, and we can use it to formulate a policy. But usually part of your policy is engaging with the people whose behavior you\u2019re trying to change at some level. And I don\u2019t think those two things are in distinction. The fact is, these other governments and their populations do read the report, and I don\u2019t think they discount it because the President speaks with their leader or otherwise. And when the President speaks to their leader, often he\u2019s talking about these issues, so it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s complementary, it\u2019s not a \u2013 two things that are in conflict\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Since we\u2019re citing examples, what does Saudi law say about spousal abuse?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Saudi law is very, very restrictive on women. We\u2019ve tried to encourage changes in that, we\u2019ve seen the minor changes that are reflected in the report, that they\u2019ve started to say they\u2019re going to allow women to drive cars and so on. That isn\u2019t very much, but it is a baby step in the right direction, and we\u2019re trying to encourage more of that kind of reform at the same time that we\u2019re calling out the areas in which they\u2019re deficient, which are many.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>All right, Rich Hudson from Fox News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks, Heather. Ambassador, I want to follow up a little bit on Saudi Arabia, the conversation you were just having with Dave. You note in the report \u2013 and a lot has happened on the government level in Saudi Arabia in just the past year, and you note in the report the jailing or hoteling of 200 officials there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Yep. Hoteling, that\u2019s a good \u2013 (laughter).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are you \u2013 overall, in Saudi Arabia, are you encouraged by some of the things that are happening? Are you discouraged by what\u2019s happened over the last year? Where do you see the trend going in Saudi Arabia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, of course it\u2019s always hard to predict trends, but I think \u2013 I\u2019m always encouraged when you start to see things break out of a static holding pattern. When you see a little bit of change as we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia, and the hoteling was connected to \u2013 ostensibly anyway \u2013 to more of concern about corruption, which is not \u2013 another one of our issues, insofar as corruption and human rights abuse seem to \u2013 tend to go together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re trying to encourage that kind of movement on the part of the Saudis. At the same time, you can look at that and say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t do this with sufficient due process,\u201d and I think that\u2019s also well spelled-out here. So it\u2019s trying to get that right balance of, hey here\u2019s where we think you\u2019re deficient, but we\u2019re seeing some movement and we\u2019re trying to encourage the movement in the positive direction and see more. But I\u2019m usually more encouraged when I see some movement going on than when things are just stuck in the same rut for years and years and years. So in that sense, at least there\u2019s an opportunity there. We\u2019ll see if it comes to anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>So is hoteling now going to be standard language in --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>I think your colleague just came up with a new term with --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Cindy with Voice of America. We have a few minutes left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, thank you. We were talking about press freedoms, and you\u2019re probably aware that in Nicaragua, the Ortega Government ordered at least five television stations off the air for their coverage of massive protests. What is the U.S. Government prepared to do to stem this new wave of repression?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, Nicaragua is \u2013 and I think if you looked at the report \u2013 is going to wrong direction on many fronts and that is one of them, of media freedom. But also on all the basics, I mean, it\u2019s a long litany of torture, extrajudicial killing, the elections were a sham. And so we\u2019ve put more and more pressure on \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see some of the sanctions programs will start to affect some people in that country. But it\u2019s a tough one; the Ortega Government has basically shut down a lot of the opposition, a lot of the independent civil society organizations as well as the free media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I mean, in our policy everywhere, and certainly in Nicaragua, is to try to provide both moral \u2013 and to the extent we can support NGOs and so on that are working to keep \u2013 to help them keep working, help free media keep working, and bring about a change in that dimension. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s tough, but we can\u2019t do it ourselves. We have to be in a position of supporting the people in those countries that are trying to bring about change, and we try to do that through a variety of means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he met with any Nicaraguans \u2013 but at the Summit of the Americas had meetings with civil society activists from Cuba, Venezuela \u2013 same camp as Nicaragua \u2013 and it was in part just to give them that \u2013 show that we stand with them and that we\u2019re trying to be supportive of what they\u2019re trying to do to bring about change in their own country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question about Gaza and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Janne. Janne, go right \u2013 excuse me, Janne, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korean human rights issues, as the North Korean nuclear issue is an important issue and the North Korean human rights is also serious issues, unless the regime of the North Korean Kim Jong-un changes, the North Korean human rights abuse against the North Korean people will continue. What is the U.S. solutions on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay. We have \u2013 I mean, we are concerned about the nuclear issue in North Korea, but we\u2019re equally concerned about the human rights issues, and they both derive from the same problem. And I think you see in the report we\u2019ve laid out pretty starkly the kinds of abuses, and over the last year or two, we\u2019ve supported, like, a commission of inquiry on North Korea, we support NGOs that are working on North Korea and exposing the human rights abuses that occur in the camps there and so on. But some of the stories that are contained in the report are just overwhelming. There\u2019s one about 11 people who were arrested for supposedly making a pornographic film and they were executed by shooting anti-artillery weapons at them, and then they brought out tanks and ran over the bodies, and this is supposed to be a civilized country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t think you will see a diminishment in our concern about that issue even as we try to work the nuclear issue. It\u2019s not a trade-off. I think the President\u2019s laid out a vision there that North Korea can get on a much better path, but it needs to make progress across the board, not just on one issue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, thank you. Sir, you \u2013 the report considers China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea forces of instability. What do you mean by that? And will there be any consequences?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve called them as forces of instability in the report. Perhaps --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, in the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> In the preface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> In the preface. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, exactly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think that has to do with their international behavior as well as their internal behavior. I mean, sometimes, internal behavior \u2013 you can\u2019t really separate them because when you start oppressing your own people, you generate refugee flows, you generate humanitarian crises like you\u2019re seeing in Venezuela, for example. So \u2013 but there\u2019s not \u2013 saying something is a force of instability is saying or characterizing a set of facts. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a prescribed policy flow. None of this does.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis report doesn\u2019t say countries that reach a certain level we\u2019re going to cut off aid or something like that. It\u2019s the factual predicate for making those decisions, but those are policy decisions where the President and his advisors will have to weigh a whole number of factors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> And our final question --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask \u2013 can I ask a question on the Gaza and the West Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> -- Kylie from CBS News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because, I mean, he pointed to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just go back to the reproductive rights for a second? So you said there are no obstacles for women to get contraception in any country except for if there\u2019s a remote issue, right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> I said with some exceptions, and the exceptions were and still are \u2013 and we\u2019ve really gotten at it by flipping back to the original U.S. statutory language. It\u2019s in places like China, where in order to enforce their two \u2013 now two-child policy, that there are reports of coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization. In North Korea, where the government also coerces or forces abortion \u2013 although sometimes that\u2019s for political punishment rather than family planning. And we uncovered it \u2013 so as we were digging through trying to reduce the bulk of some of this report, I found in the old country I served in, in Belarus, that it turns out that the doctors in the state hospitals, and particularly in the institutions there, if they have a woman who is pregnant and who is a woman with disabilities, the doctors insist on an abortion. Or if they believe the fetus has a disability, they\u2019ll insist on an abortion. So we\u2019ve called that out too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not \u2013 those were the cases, though, in the \u2013 under the previous formula where you would say there was a restriction on family planning, freedom of family planning. For most countries, it said, there isn\u2019t any restriction except for the ones imposed by economics and rural-urban type thing. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So just to be clear just on that, so taking out the language about those cases therefore means that the U.S. doesn\u2019t believe that the inability for women to get an abortion physically or by law is an abuse of human rights?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> That \u2013 correct under the previous administration and this one and the one before that. We have never taken the position that abortion was a right under \u2013 a human right under international law. This is supposed to be internationally recognized human rights, and it\u2019s an issue on which \u2013 some countries prohibit abortion, some countries, like our own, pretty much no restriction on it, and we don\u2019t say one of those is right and one of those is wrong. We don\u2019t report on it because it\u2019s not a human right. It\u2019s an issue of great policy debate, you can have a good discussion, but there\u2019s no internationally recognized standard as to what\u2019s the right treatment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the other, yes. The \u2013 it is internationally recognized that somebody shouldn\u2019t coerce you to have an abortion or force you to be sterilized, so that\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Thank you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question on the Palestinian --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We \u2013 the ambassador has to go. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, one quick question on the Palestinian (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We have to go. Sir, thank you. Thank you. We\u2019ll get you another time.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you, Shaun. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for this on-the-record conference call. We have with us Dr. Peter Navarro, who\u2019s the assistant to the President for trade and manufacturing policy and director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. He is joined by Ambassador Tina Kaidanow. She is the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs here at the Department of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe call today will be on the updated Conventional Arms Transfer policy and Unmanned Aerial Systems export policy. This call is on the record, but I\u2019d note that the contents of the call will be embargoed until the Conventional Arms Transfer policy is posted on the White House website at approximately 12:00 p.m. today, Thursday, April 19.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019d also like to note that we have with us on the phone Mr. Gregory Kausner. He\u2019s the deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. He\u2019s able to participate with us today. He will be happy to field any questions that are addressed to the DSCA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dr. Navarro. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Thank you. I want to start by thanking the Department of State and the National Security Council for all their tremendous work leading this process over the past year, along with all our interagency partners. This collaboration underscores the President\u2019s vision that economic security is national security. The fact is our allies and partners want to buy American. They know American industries produce the most technologically sophisticated, accurate, and effective defense systems in the world. When we enable our allies and partners to more easily obtain appropriate American defense articles and services, we improve our national security. Partners who procure American weaponry are more capable of fighting alongside us and ultimately more capable of protecting themselves with fewer American boots on the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tProviding our allies and partners with greater access to American arms will also reduce their reliance not just on Chinese knockoffs, but also on Russian systems, consistent with the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. For too long we have hamstrung ourselves and limited our ability to provide our allies and partners with the defensive capabilities they require, even when in the U.S. interest. President Trump\u2019s new CAT policy, which reforms the myopic 2014 policy of his predecessor, will ensure that American interests are put first in our own decision making.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe administration\u2019s UAS export policy will level the playing field by enabling U.S. firms to increase their direct sales to authorized allies and partners. By expanding international sales opportunities, U.S. industry will be further incentivized to do what they do best: invest and innovate. This will keep our defense industrial base in the vanguard of emerging defense technologies while creating thousands of additional jobs with good wages and generating substantial export revenues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. aerospace and defense industries contribute almost a trillion dollars annually to our economy and support about 2.5 million jobs while maintaining a significant global trade surplus. As President Trump works to balance our trade with the rest of the world, further strengthening a critical part of our export economy and defense industrial base is a logical and critical step.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ll now turn it over to Ambassador Kaidanow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Thanks very much. Actually, I\u2019m going to leave that statement because I think it speaks volumes, and maybe just open it up for any further questions. We\u2019re very, very pleased that we now have the opportunity to engage in this conversation. As Dr. Navarro said, it\u2019s been a process that\u2019s taken some time to put together thoughtfully, and we want to be able to talk about it with all of you. So thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> All right, thank you. With that, we\u2019ll turn to our questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do wish to ask a question, please press *1. Our first question is going to come from the line of Matthew Lee from the Associated Press. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi there. Good morning. I just \u2013 I have two brief ones. Number one: What exactly is changing about \u2013 how is it now or going to be easier for allies and partners to buy these drone systems and the other things?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd secondly: Didn\u2019t \u2013 you refer, Dr. Navarro, to the myopic policy of the previous administration. Didn\u2019t this begin, this review with an eye toward easing these restrictions, begin during the previous administration? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Okay, well, I\u2019ll start, and then if Dr. Navarro wants to chime in, he\u2019s welcome to. What I would say is as follows: Let\u2019s remember, again, first of all, there\u2019s the discussion of sort of the wider array of things that fall under the conventional arms treaty \u2013 Conventional Arms Transfer initiative. That is a wider set of things than simply just the UAS policy; we should bear that in mind. And in that instance, or with that regard, what we are explicitly doing there is inserting a definition of economic security, right \u2013 consideration, I should say, of economic security into our broader national security considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in other words, it\u2019s not that we are necessarily doing one thing. You\u2019re doing a number of things, and I hope that we will be able to talk interactively with industry associations \u2013 that\u2019s part of this effort \u2013 to hear what they have to say about how we can more strategically address some of their concerns and enable them to make sales overseas. That will be done within the very near future. In fact, we\u2019re \u2013 as part of the explicit element here, you\u2019ll see some of this when it comes out in the new NSPM so-called. But at any rate, we will be talking to them within the next 60 days so we can put together a specific work plan to actually implement all of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut \u2013 so in other words, it is efforts to do things a little more strategically. We need to do, as the U.S. Government, a better job of strategic advocacy for some of our companies. We need to think about those areas where we can really enable sales overseas. We need to think about how might they sell things that are a little bit harder to sell. We recognize that because the quality of our product is so high, sometimes, for example, it\u2019s more expensive than others. Well, just because of that, we don\u2019t want to disadvantage them. We\u2019d like to find ways to help enable countries to buy our product even when it may be slightly more expensive and so forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we need to be working with our companies to find the ways for strategic advocacy to do all of these things that will enable them, and we are specifically looking, again, as Dr. Navarro said, at the question of how do we enable these companies, how do we provide economic security for the United States, how do we make sure we\u2019re creating American jobs and American prosperity as part of the larger picture, the balance and responsible policy that we have with regard to all the things we consider when we look at any particular arms sale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I\u2019m going to leave it there and then Dr. Navarro, if you want to chime in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Again, the fact of the matter here is, although the U.S. leads the way in UAS technology, overly restrictive policies enacted by the previous administration have accelerated an undesirable outcome. Strategic competitors like China are aggressively marketing to and making sales in international markets that are forecast to be worth more than $50 billion a year within the next decade. Already, we are seeing Chinese replicas of American UAS technology deployed on the runways in the Middle East. In June, at the Paris Air Show, China\u2019s Chengdu Aircraft Group featured its Wing Loong II medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS, a clear knockoff of General Atomics Reaper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBottom line, the policies of the previous administration enabled that, and this administration, consistent with its national security strategy and national defense strategy, is changing that policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Let me \u2013 sorry, just let me add one more thing specific to the UAS policy itself because I mentioned that\u2019s it\u2019s a part of, but it\u2019s an important part of the overall changes under the new CAT policy. We are enabling not just some additional sales of MTCR Category 1; we are actually looking at allowing these companies \u2013 Dr. Navarro mentioned we\u2019re allowing them to go forward and make a function of what we call direct commercial sales \u2013 in other words, to directly make sales to the countries rather than via the U.S. Government. That\u2019s a major change. And we will give them additional space for marketing of these systems and for the eventual sale, assuming that they meet all the other criteria, the sale meets all the other criteria that we would normally consider.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are other things the new policy will do. It\u2019ll eliminate the special scrutiny of laser designators on UAS. That\u2019s one of the things that has hampered the sale of these particular systems. So there\u2019s a number of things within the policy itself that will help enable and widen the space, if you want to call it that, for the sales.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you very much. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question, then, comes from the line of Aaron Mehta from Defense News. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this, guys. A couple of things just to make it clear: So is there any change in the presumption of denial and \u2013 with the unmanned systems? And if so, how is it actually \u2013 if there\u2019s no change, how is it actually different from what the Obama administration set up in 2015 with that standard? And then can you just go into why the laser designator decision was made and what that actually means in terms of being able to sell these things to different countries?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Let me be clear, first of all, that the presumption of denial is not a feature of a particular administration. The presumption of denial comes as a feature of the MTCR regime itself. And the rationale behind it is one that I think is understandable and it still pertains, and that is it is supposed to prevent the proliferation of systems that may indeed cause \u2013 of weapons of mass destruction, in essence, and those systems in particular that might, for example, endanger U.S. troops.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we have to have those considerations in mind and that\u2019s why I say this is a balance policy. It does not change the presumption of denial under the MTCR, okay? It\u2019s \u2013 again, this is a regime that is a multilateral regime and it\u2019s existed for some time. The point is that what we are looking to do is take that presumption of denial, assess it against other factors \u2013 and these are important factors, the ones that I mentioned before, and there will be others \u2013 but the point is that we will work to update the MCTR. That\u2019s another issue. We are looking to ensure that the MTCR keeps pace with the dynamic quality of all of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s remember that the things that, for example, two or three years ago may have been, again, endangering our troops may have been of concern to us with regard to the spread of weapons of mass destruction, now may have commercial applications. There may be things that, again, over time, do not concern us in quite the same way. So we are looking together with our partners to update the MTCR. That\u2019s an ongoing process. But the existing presumption of denial \u2013 that doesn\u2019t change. What we are doing is \u2013 again, we are widening the space for the companies to do their sales and marketing via direct commercial sales. We\u2019re eliminating some of the specific factors that in the past we looked at when we approved these sales or we didn\u2019t. And what we are doing is ensuring that, again, that the MTCR itself keeps pace with the changes over time that we think are salient and need to be considered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roxana Tiron from Bloomberg. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. Hi. Thank you for doing this. Two questions, actually: Is there \u2013 are there any considerations given to make sure that some of these arm sales don\u2019t end up to countries that violate human rights? And also, President Trump yesterday said that this could allow sales of weapons to go through in just days, but Congress still has about 30 days to block a proposed sale. Does that change? Is there any change in that as well?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Okay. So let me be very clear. Nothing in the \u2013 this new NSPM that will be issued changes either the existing legal or the regulatory requirements. And we are very respectful of Congress\u2019s role in all of this. Again, we consider them to be our partners and they are the ones that ultimately will authorize a number of these sales, in so far as \u2013 again, we have good consultation with them. There is a process by which all this flows. I won\u2019t get into all the mechanics of that here. I\u2019m happy offline to talk about it, or we can give you a lot more detail on how that all works. But the point is Congress retains its role. Again, no change to the legal or regulatory framework.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the important thing again here to remember \u2013 you asked about human rights. The real question for us \u2013 again, this is a balanced policy. We absolutely look at human rights as one of a set of considerations that we look at. It\u2019s all done \u2013 every sale we do is done on a case-by-case basis. In other words, we look at a whole range of U.S. national security objectives. Dr. Navarro talked about some of them. We are looking, again, at the \u2013 we are looking at the \u2013 again, the entire range. And let\u2019s remember, U.S. national security make \u2013 is comprised \u2013 may be comprised of a whole set of things. We look at democracy, at governance, at human rights, at economic development, at security, at the creation of U.S. national \u2013 or U.S. jobs and American prosperity. We look at all those things, with an emphasis on making sure that, again, companies can operate in that space, that they have every opportunity to do their business within that set of considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn human rights specifically, let me just mention we have been very, very focused, especially in this administration and in tandem with Congress, on trying to give our partners, our strategic partners overseas, the ability to avoid civilian causalities especially where we can. I know that\u2019s the focus of \u2013 in Congress and the wider array of public opinion. This is really important. We need to give them an understanding \u2013 using some of our experience, give them an understanding of how to minimize civilian causalities to the extent possible when they are doing their operations overseas. That\u2019s critically important to us. I really want to emphasize that, because, again, we have focused on it so very hard over the last little while, especially with Congress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Yeah. Let me echo what Ambassador Kaidanow said, because it\u2019s so important. The new policy clearly and strongly recognizes the need for responsible balance. And just some of the key issues include human rights, nonproliferation, as well as safeguards against the transfer of our technology, the theft of that, to bad actors. And the safeguards that are put in place include things like prescreening, principles of proper use, training and support, and a continuation of stringent end-use monitoring. So this is a key part of President Trump\u2019s new policies. And again, as Ambassador Kaidanow said, they require enhanced end-use monitoring, directing the federal government to work with partners in reducing civilian causalities in conflict, and championing principles of human rights and international law, including the law of armed conflict. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Let me \u2013 sorry, just to add one thing, and again, to emphasize \u2013 this is so salient and Dr. Navarro just mentioned it again, but this is the first time that minimizing civilian casualties indeed will be an affirmative part of our conventional arms policy. So that really is a change, and it\u2019s an important change, and is one that I think we\u2019re incredibly focused on as we do our work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Stone from Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks for doing this. What is the number of jobs that will be created by this? And what is the estimated dollar amount that defense exports will go up, making them go from X to Y?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Dr. Navarro?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> So we\u2019re going to say at the general 30,000-foot level. This will all be a function of how the sales go forward and through the review process. So that would merely be speculation at this point. What we do know is that this will provide the American industry with expanded opportunities, and that\u2019s the signature of President Trump\u2019s administration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Your next question\u2019s coming from the line of Charles Forrester from Jane\u2019s. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Good afternoon, or morning rather. Thank you very much for doing this. Question for you is regarding offset technology transfer. Now some of the markets that you\u2019ve mentioned here, in the Middle East and India for example, very strong on technology transfer and getting some of that work done out there as part of a package deal. How do you see that reconciling with the new policy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Well, what I would say is with regard to \u2013 first of all, I think you know that in certain particular instances, we are \u2013 we allow the companies to do the actual negotiations with regard to offsets and other requirements and so forth. The U.S. Government itself doesn\u2019t get in the middle of that set of negotiations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut again, let\u2019s remember that what the NSPM will call for is within 60 days we are apt to produce a work plan. And that work plan, again, will be done and created in conjunction with a number of these companies and with some of the industry associations. In putting it together, we will be looking at a whole array of things, not just coproduction but, again, things that will enable sales overseas: strategic efforts to create an environment in which our companies can push back against foreign competitors, make our products as competitive as possible, advance sales, all those things that we want to be doing. Financing advocacy \u2013 in other words, looking at ways that we might, again, if our product ends up being slightly more expensive because it is better, then how do we enable countries to really do that so that they can purchase those systems. So there\u2019s a whole array of things that may come. We\u2019re going to have that conversation with companies, but it\u2019s important that we look at that whole array of things in order to give us a better understanding of where we can be most effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our last --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO: </strong>I would just add to that the organizational culture of the Trump administration is: buy American, hire American. These are the two simple rules that President Trump has repeatedly stressed, and be assured that this administration will be encouraging private defense industry to embrace those principles as it goes forward with its expanded opportunities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Okay. We\u2019ll take our last question now, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Then our final question will come from Aaron Mehta from Defense News. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi, you guys. Sorry. I just wanted to follow up on the laser designation question from earlier. What is actually being changed about that? Why does that change matter? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>So basically what it means is that we\u2019ll be reducing the complications to how we classify UAS. Because under the previous policy, UAS equipped with so-called strike-enabling technology, like laser target designators, were classified under a specific, discrete category. And the criteria for transferring that category of UAS was equivalent to the criteria for transferring an armed UAS. So we placed the proposed transfer of UASs equipped with strike-enabling technologies under significant scrutiny in the past, and we limited their transfer to occur only through the Foreign Military Sale system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat approach caused a lot of confusion within industry and our partners, so the new policy does away with this category of quote-un-quote striking-enabling, and those technologies that were previously classified as such are now treated as unarmed, essentially. So eliminating that kind of distinction makes it easier, or makes it so that U.S. industry faces fewer barriers and less confusion when they\u2019re attempting to compete against other countries in marketing and selling those similar systems to our partners. So what it does is it allows them effectively to sell you UAS with laser target designators via direct commercial sale, which, as I mentioned previously, can potentially allow for faster procurement by those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>And before we close, I just want to offer Mr. Kausner from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency an opportunity to comment on any of the topics raised, if he has any comments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR KAUSNER: </strong>Nothing to add. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>All right. Terrific. Well with that then, we\u2019ll conclude the call. I remind everyone that the contents of the call is on the record, but embargoed until the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy is posted on the White House website. That link was provided in the advisory sent out for this call, and we expect that will be around 12:00 p.m. noon today, Thursday April 19th. Thank you everyone, and have an enjoyable day.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

The law enforcement component will build upon the cross-border counterterrorism communication, coordination, and response at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels between military and civilian law enforcement to counter terrorist threats and attacks. In general, the law enforcement integration into Flintlock provides a series of training sessions focusing on tactical rural patrol and crisis response capabilities, counterterrorism investigations, command and communication management, post blast and crime scene investigations, community engagement, and human rights. The State Department will also integrate rule of law engagement and humanitarian border management training into components of the exercise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe State Department is proud to be part of this exercise and values this opportunity for information sharing and integration of civilian law enforcement with the military to increase security sector and multinational interoperability and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and terrorist organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tParticipating African nations include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal.

        "date": "March 23, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\tAt the 37<sup>th</sup> Human Rights Council session in Geneva, February 26-March 23, the U.S. addressed urgent human rights situations around the world. This session brought attention to human rights issues in Iran, Syria, North Korea, Burma, Cambodia and South Sudan, among others. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee delivered our national statement on February 28, underscoring the U.S. commitment to human rights, as well as our continued concerns about the Council\u2019s disproportionate focus on Israel and our commitment to reforming the Council. The United States introduced a resolution on South Sudan that the Council adopted with broad cross-regional support. Our active engagement on all other Council actions allowed the U.S. to protect critical legal and policy equities and achieve successful outcomes. In addition, through national and joint statements, the United States addressed human rights situations in China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, the DRC, Egypt, Turkey, Burundi, Azerbaijan, the Maldives, Vietnam, and Bahrain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Supporting Israel:</b> The United States worked closely with Israel and other partners to combat the institutionalized bias against Israel both by opposing Agenda Item 7, the only Council agenda item focused on a single country, and by voting against every resolution introduced under Item 7. Australia joined in voting against all Item 7 resolutions, while many other partners changed votes to either vote no or abstain. This session demonstrated the largest shift in votes towards more abstentions and no votes on Israel related resolutions since the creation of the HRC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Standing up for the Integrity of UN Human Rights Mechanisms:</b> The United States voted against a China-led resolution on <b>mutually beneficial cooperation</b>, which sought to weaken international human rights frameworks by demanding that governments be \u201crespected\u201d (i.e. not have their human rights records criticized) and suggesting that governments could agree on \u201cwin-win\u201d exceptions to human rights concerns. In a strong explanation of vote, the United States underscored that \u201cfeel good\u201d language about mutually beneficial cooperation is intended to benefit autocratic states at the expense of individuals whose human rights and fundamental freedoms we should all respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Iran</b>: The United States played a key role in garnering support for the resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The United States also read, on behalf of a group of 27 countries, a joint statement addressing the recent crackdown in Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>North Korea:</b> The United States supported a resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, condemned the ongoing systematic and widespread human rights violations and abuses, called for accountability, and voiced ongoing support for monitoring and documentation efforts by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Syria: </b>The United States supported an urgent debate on the dire situation in eastern Ghouta, which culminated in a resolution condemning the violations of the ceasefire. The United States also co-sponsored the resolution renewing the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which condemned the violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law throughout Syria, primarily by the Assad regime, including the use of chemical weapons, abuse of detainees, and denial of humanitarian aid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>South Sudan:</b> The United States led a resolution to renew the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for another year to collect and preserve evidence that can be used in future judicial efforts, including the AU Hybrid Court for South Sudan. We worked closely with South Sudan, members of the African Group, and other member states to ensure the text was adopted by consensus. South Sudan\u2019s support for the resolution reaffirmed its commitment to continue cooperating with the Commission and UN bodies and mechanisms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Burma: </b>The United States co-sponsored an EU-led resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and support the work of other special procedures, including the Fact Finding Mission, which are invaluable in investigating and highlighting the human rights situation in Burma. The resolution was adopted following a vote called by China.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Cambodia</b>: The United States joined 44 other countries in supporting New Zealand\u2019s joint statement highlighting the decline in civil and political rights in Cambodia in the run up to national elections scheduled for July 29. The joint statement noted that an electoral process from which the main democratic opposition party is arbitrarily excluded cannot be considered genuine or legitimate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Other Country Situations:</b> The United States co-sponsored priority resolutions that renewed mandates on <b>Burma</b> and <b>North Korea</b>, as well as a resolution drawing attention to the human rights situations in <b>Georgia</b>, including the Russian-occupied territories of Georgia. We supported cooperative resolutions on <b>Libya</b> and <b>Mali.</b> The United States also delivered a statement supporting the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 engagement in <b>Yemen</b>, <b>Georgia</b>, <b>Afghanistan</b>, and <b>Haiti</b>. Additionally, the United States joined joint statements highlighting serious concerns regarding the human rights situations in <b>Cambodia</b>, <b>Maldives</b>, and <b>Sri Lanka</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Development Resolutions: </b>The United States worked actively to remove trade-related language from resolutions on development, and to ensure that all resolutions that touch on development make clear that states may not use their lack of development or related concerns to excuse a failure to uphold their human rights obligations or commitments. We re-stated our long-standing opposition to recognizing a \u201cright to development.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Thematic Issues:</b> The United States co-sponsored resolutions on <b>freedom of religion or belief</b>, <b>good governance</b>, the prevention of <b>genocide</b>, the rights of <b>minorities</b> and of persons with <b>disabilities</b>, and the impact of corruption on <b>torture</b>, among others. The United States also opposed a cynical Russia-led resolution on \u201cintegrity of the judicial system,\u201d which failed to address issues of judicial independence, and inaccurately reflected aspects of international law.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients. You can applause. (Laughter.) (Applause.) We would like to welcome them into the room. (Applause.) And they have come a long, long way to get here to meet you in Washington. (Applause.)</span></span>\n\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to welcome First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump. Melania, Mrs. Trump, welcome. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Thank you, everyone, and welcome to the State Department. I am honored to welcome you to the 12th Annual Secretary of State\u2019s International Women of Courage Awards, which have recognized more than 120 remarkable women from dozens of countries since the award\u2019s inception. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In addition to the privilege of being joined by the First Lady, I would also like to extend a special welcome to the members of the diplomatic corps in the audience, including Ambassador Callista Gingrich. Where is she? She\u2019s here somewhere. Thank you, there she is. Ambassador Gingrich, welcome. (Applause.) She joins us from the Vatican today and has been in Washington this week. It\u2019s wonderful to have you back here with us.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We know that women\u2019s voices are critical to global security, prosperity, and peace, which is why the Department of State annually presents the International Women of Courage Awards. Each awardee\u2019s story is an inspiring reminder of how individuals can make a difference. Taken together, they provide a powerful message of courage and leadership. And you can read some of their profiles in your pamphlets that you have with you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This year we have recognized 10 extraordinary women who have demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight day in and day out for what they believe. The formidable leaders include a former slave and anti-slavery activist, a human rights lawyer documenting abuse under the junta rule, a nun sheltering internally displaced people from violence, a writer, director, and producer who wrote scripts under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and a courageous advocate for the families of forcibly disappeared persons. We are so happy to have them here today.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States is proud to honors these leaders as part of our commitment to advancing the status of women and girls around the world. I want to take a moment to thank my colleagues in the Secretary\u2019s Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues for the work that they do to ensure that women\u2019s equality and empowerment are integrated into our U.S. foreign policy. Our GWI folks, thank you so much for bringing them all together. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>I\u2019d also like to recognize the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, whose people-to-people programs are a critical element of our diplomacy, including the International Visitor Leadership Program these women are about to embark on for the next two weeks, I believe, as they share their stories with audiences around the United States.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This commitment to women\u2019s empowerment is the reason that President Trump signed the Women, Peace, and Security Act into law last October. The new law affirms the United States commitment to expanding women\u2019s leadership on the issues of international peace and security, especially efforts to prevent conflict and atrocities, promote peace and counterterrorism, and also violent extremism. We know that when women are empowered, communities are safer and countries are more stable. We see that around the world every day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Another way to ensure that women are empowered is by expanding economic access and opportunity. Reports show that if the world closed the gender gap in workforce participation, global GDP would increase by $28 trillion by the year 2025. That is precisely why President Trump galvanized the creation of the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Finance Initiative through a U.S. contribution of $50 million at the G20 Leaders Summit last summer. Along with contributions from international partners, the initiative has leveraged more than 340 million in support to help advance women\u2019s entrepreneurship around the globe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>From day one, the Trump administration has been committed to empowering women. Women\u2019s empowerment is not only a basic fulfilment of human rights, but a strategic investment in our collective future. Women and girls must have the tools they need to succeed and the pathways that they seek opened. That includes a safe environment that promotes their health and also their education. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Whether at home or abroad, expanding opportunities for women and girls is a priority of this President for this administration. And today I\u2019m honored to introduce someone who plays a central role in this critical initiative. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>As a philanthropist and a humanitarian, the First Lady has been a driving force behind the administration\u2019s efforts to promote the empowerment of women and children in our society. Mrs. Trump has been an Honorary Chairwoman for the Boys\u2019 Club of New York for five consecutive years and in 2005 was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador for the American Red Cross. She helped launch the National Child Abuse Prevention Month in April of 2008 and has been a champion for the American Heart Association. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Her deep concern for issues affecting children continues. As First Lady she is focused on the challenges of what children are exposed to online through technology. And as a mom whose children are always trying to sneak her electronic devices, I thank you for your work on that. (Laughter.) A lot of us can relate to that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump works tirelessly to raise awareness of the damaging effects of opioids and the harmful effects that drugs can have on pregnant women, particularly on newborns who develop neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS. Mrs. Trump, the State Department has watched with a great deal of pride as you visited hospitals and women\u2019s groups around the country to draw attention to this. Thank you for that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump is a powerful voice promoting women\u2019s equality and improving the lives of women and girls around the world. Now please join me in welcoming the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Melania Trump. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The First Lady gives remarks.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Mrs. Trump. Thanks to all of you. As Mrs. Trump just discussed, courage takes many, many forms. This year, we are honored to recognize 10 extraordinary women who have dedicated and demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight for what they believe in day in and day out. I\u2019d like to introduce you to these women.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>First, we have Roya Sadat. She\u2019s from Afghanistan. She is a writer, a producer, a film director. Ms. Sadat, she\u2019s over here. She is being honored for refusing to be silenced in her home country. She uses the arts to raise awareness of the brutal challenges facing women and girls, and despite threats to herself, her cast, and her crew, she\u2019s served as a pioneer for Afghanistan\u2019s cultural reawakening. In fact, she wrote her film, \u201cThree Dots,\u201d while keeping it a secret from the Taliban, and many of you will recall that entertainment was not allowed \u2013 music, films, all of that was not allowed under the Taliban. Congratulations to you. Thank you for your bravery. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next, from Honduras, we have Dr. Julissa Villanueva.

Welcome and thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aliyah Khalaf Saleh. She\u2019s from Iraq. A humanitarian volunteer working to resist sectarian and radical ideology, Ms. Saleh is being honored for her bravery, her heroism, and her compassion in the wake of ISIS terror. She selflessly risked her own life to save others. In fact, she is credited with rescuing 58 young Iraqi military cadets who were ambushed by ISIS back in 2014. Imagine the bravery that takes for a woman in that country. It\u2019s really incredible. She risked her own life to save others, and working with all Iraqi communities as well as security forces. Congratulations. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Such tremendous bravery in this room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Sister Maria Elena Berini.

She is a lawyer, a human rights defender, a promoter of justice and other reforms. Ms. Umarova is being honored for improving laws to address violence against women and children, delivering justice in a number of landmark cases for rape victims, and her efforts in countering violent extremism despite the grave risks that she faces in Kazakhstan. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Dr. Feride Rushiti is from Kosovo. She\u2019s the founder and executive director of the Kosovo Center for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims. Dr. Rushiti is being honored for decades of advocacy on behalf of civilian victims of Kosovo\u2019s war, including rape survivors, and she\u2019s laid the groundwork for a legislative victory to support survivors of wartime sexual violence. Thank you, Doctor. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To Mauritania now. I would like to introduce you to L\u2019Malouma Said from Mauritania. She\u2019s a former slave and now a deputy member of parliament in Mauritania\u2019s National Assembly. That is incredible. (Applause.) Mrs. Said is being honored \u2013 wait here, Mrs. Said. (Laughter.) You can stay here. We\u2019re not done yet. Stay right there. Thank you. Mrs. Said is being honored for her relentless activism in the fight against slavery, including work in the country\u2019s most effective anti-slavery organization; perseverance and promotion of human rights and equality; and resolve in addressing a failing prison system in Mauritania.

She is a lawyer and human rights defender and is being honored for fiercely standing up for human rights. She includes \u2013 this includes the rights to peaceful assembly and expression. During Thailand\u2019s military rule, she co-founded an organization to provide pro bono legal services to those who are facing politically motivated charges and overcoming unprecedented harassment and persecution. As a result of her advocacy, she now faces three sets of criminal charges for her work as a lawyer, and those charges include sedition. What a brave woman. Thank you.

She has been an activist since her brother disappeared back in 1984. Since then, she\u2019s received death threats, and has even been kidnapped by armed assailants in her country. We recognize Ms. Farfan in absentia today, as she is not able to travel to Washington from Guatemala due to a current medical condition that she suffers.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So please join me in thanking these women, welcoming these women to the United States, and I would like to introduce you to our next speaker. Please join me in giving a round of applause for this remarkable group of leaders, and it is my pleasure to introduce one of our women of courage, who will give remarks on behalf of the group, Godelive Mukasarasi from Rwanda. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS MUKASARASI:</b> Mrs. Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to stand here to tell you my joy and my gratitude for this acknowledgement of my work in Rwanda. As a committed activist, I have been fighting for the rights of women, victims of rape, and their children born of such rapes during the genocide against the Tutsis in 1993 and \u201994. Through an extensive therapy process to help heal them of their trauma and through active advocacy, the rape victims have become models of self-development and resilient citizens.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>During the genocide, one million innocent lives were lost and millions of survivors were affected by the trauma, left with physical and emotional wounds. Rape has been used as a war weapon. Tutsi women and girls raped, raped en masse, and some of them became pregnant or by the militia and soldiers of the former regime. A number of these women were infected with HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Some underwent genital mutilation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Others were forced to marry the perpetrators as a price to escape death, therefore becoming sexual servants and captives. When the militias were defeated, the women returned to their families but were rejected and stigmatized by relatives for having been the spouse of a militia member or for being pregnant by them. They were told to abort or to walk away with their cursed pregnancy. Some of these women decided to abort or they have left their families to hide far away, protecting those babies who today are beautiful 24 year-old women and the men.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Even too, the Government of Rwanda has done everything to address the effect of the genocide, the cases of rape were kept silent, because speaking of sexual issues is taboo in Rwanda culture. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Breaking the silence of this crime, I started the SEVOTA organization in Taba in December 1994. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Before meeting SEVOTA organization, every woman thought she was alone and would remain humiliated. But when sharing their stories, they find out that they could decided to accept themselves and accept their children. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>After experiencing the SEVOTA healing session and receiving assistance, these Rwandan women decide to speak out against the rape and stood up to testify about them in the international criminal court of Rwanda. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These women \u2013 these women\u2019s advocacy persuaded the international community make rape punishable as a crime against humanity. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These resilient women and young people are fully integrated in the community, undertaking income-producing activities, sustaining themselves, and preventing renewed trauma. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>However, there is the need for more attention, as many of them are living with post-traumatic effects such as HIV/AIDS, poverty, and a fragilized and wounded memory.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This is why SEVOTA continues to advocate, to heal, and to participate in self-development program using different channel \u2013 different channel, such as the recent film \u201cThe Uncondemned,\u201d where Seraphine, Victoria, and Cecile played a key role in speaking out. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my profound gratitude toward those who have encouraged me, including the Government of Rwanda, which appoint me as one of the guardians of the social pacts, and the institution who have selected me for this prize. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Finally, I would like to extend many thank you who have attended this ceremony, and most of all, my sincerest thanks to First Lady Mrs. Melania Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, the Secretary Office for Global Women\u2019s Issues, and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you. Godelive, thank you so much. Please join me in a final round of applause for this remarkable group of women leaders. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States will continue to work the advance \u2013 the rights of women and girls globally, well aware that when women do better, countries do better, families do better, we all do better. Mrs. Trump, thank you for your inspiring words and for being part of today\u2019s ceremony and our ceremony last year as well. This is certainly your passion, and we are so grateful to have you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees, thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do. Thank you for your bravery, for your commitment, especially in the face of adversity. We honor you and your work.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At this time, I\u2019d like to ask the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients to please stand for a group photo together, and we\u2019ll get a picture together, and then we\u2019ll conclude our ceremonies.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Awardees then depart. Let\u2019s take a picture first.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The picture is taken.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees depart. Thank you, ladies. (Applause.) And thanks to all of you for coming today. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>For those of us who are joining us in our reception, you are now invited to proceed to the Ben Franklin room, and that is on the eighth floor. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, our First Lady, and thank you to these wonderful ladies. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "official_name": "Brian Hook",
        "official_title": "Director of Policy Planning",
        "date": "March 21, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us, and apologies for the slight delay in getting started. Brian Hook is joining us. As you all know, Brian was just in Europe with a delegation from the State Department and also the NSC, where Brian was meeting\u2014 and our colleagues\u2014 meeting with members of the E3 in Berlin, and then he went to Vienna \u2013 they all went to Vienna \u2013 for the quarterly meeting with the JCPOA. Brian met with press last week and overseas, and would like to provide you all not only with an update but a \u2013 just sort of an analysis and readout of where we are in the overall discussions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Brian will make some comments and then we\u2019ll have time to take several of your questions. We ask that you wait until the end of the call to start writing about this and tweeting, as we normally do, and embargoed. That\u2019s a simple way of putting it: embargoed until the conclusion of the call.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Director of Policy Planning Brian Hook for his comments and your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thank you, Heather, and thank you for organizing this call, and thanks to everybody who\u2019s joined the call. As Heather mentioned, there was an American delegation that first went to Berlin and then we went to Vienna for the Joint Commission meeting, and let me say just a little bit about both meetings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Berlin, this is the third meeting with our European allies since the President delivered his statement on January 12th. As you know, on January 12th, the President set forth the conditions that would need to be met in order for the \u2013 for him to continue waving sanctions as part of America\u2019s commitments in the JCPOA. And what the President asked for on January 12th was a new supplemental agreement with European allies that (inaudible) impose new multilateral sanctions if Iran develops or tests long-range missiles, thwarts inspections, or makes progress toward a nuclear weapon. And he has given his negotiating team until May 12th to reach a supplemental agreement to fix the deficiencies of the Iran nuclear deal. And so we have been operating under that guidance since then. We have had three meetings with our European allies \u2013 one in London, one in Paris, and then the last one was in Berlin \u2013 and at these meetings we are negotiating a new supplemental agreement and we are also \u2013 and the focus there is around the sunsets, the sunsetting of restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the omission of ICBMs from the original Iran nuclear agreement, and a stronger inspections regime so that we can support the work of the IAEA so they can verify that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 in all of these meetings, half of our day is spent negotiating a supplemental agreement. The other half of the day we spend on making progress on the six areas that the President identified on January 12th. He called on our allies to take stronger steps with the United States to confront Iran\u2019s other malign activities, and that includes cutting off funding to the IRGC and constraining Iran\u2019s missile development program, countering Iran\u2019s cyber aggression, its maritime aggression, asking other countries to pressure Iran for all of its human rights violations. So we spend half of these meetings working on steps that we need to take collectively against Iran\u2019s other activities, and this is consistent with the policy shift that this administration effected, which is addressing the totality of Iranian threats and not having (inaudible) on the nuclear deal at the exclusion of all of the other threats that Iran presents. And I would refer you to the President\u2019s statement on January 12th for more detail on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe then went to Vienna for a meeting of the Joint Commission. I think as many of you know, the Joint Commission is part of the JCPOA and it oversees the implementation of the Plan of Action that was reached in 2015 with the previous administration, and it meets on a regular basis to review Iran\u2019s compliance with the JCPOA and to address concerns raised by member states. They were productive meetings and we fulfilled what we set out to do. We are meeting our commitments under the JCPOA, and we will \u2013 we continue to hold Iran strictly accountable for its commitments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that we did in that meeting was to take stock of one of the key provisions of the JCPOA, which is that the Iran deal will, quote, \u201cpositively contribute to regional and international peace and security.\u201d That is mentioned in the deal, and since it took over two years to negotiate and every word was weighed carefully, we take all of these provisions seriously. And when you look at Iran\u2019s foreign and domestic policies, it\u2019s impossible to argue that they have \u2013 that they are behaving constructively or with greater moderation in the last two years. In fact, quite the reverse. They are aggressively destabilizing the Middle East and present a range of threats to peace and security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this was an opportunity for us in Vienna to listen to any concerns that the Iranians had about us meeting our end of the deal. The Iranians complained that this administration is warning other nations about the dangers of doing business in Iran and that this is hurting their economy. And what I said in response was that Iran\u2019s opaque economy makes it hard for investors to know whether they are supporting commerce or supporting terrorism, and I said that Iran needs to stop sponsoring terrorism, stop destabilizing the Middle East, and overhaul its banking and business sectors. It\u2019s not America\u2019s job to make up for the shortcomings of Iranian policies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also requested a meeting with the Iranian delegation to demand the release of the American citizens that they have arbitrarily and unjustly detained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the summary of the meetings in Berlin and Vienna. I\u2019m happy to take questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll go ahead and take your questions. And Nicole has a list of who\u2019s on the call, so I\u2019ll just defer to my colleague, Nicole, who will handle that. Nicole, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * then 1.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur first question comes from the line of Josh Lederman, AP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I was wondering if you have spoken to Director Pompeo in the last week about this deal. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that Secretary Tillerson was more enthusiastic about trying to salvage this deal than perhaps Pompeo will be. So can you tell us how that transition may affect the work that you\u2019re doing on this. And then if you can give us any details about your separate meeting with the Iranians; did you make any progress on those detained Americans? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks, Josh. On the first question, I don\u2019t want to comment on internal discussions. What I can say is that a number of us are providing assistance to Secretary-designate Pompeo\u2019s confirmation process, and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the Senate confirmation process, but if he is confirmed, and we certainly hope he will be, he will then be, I think, well equipped to do all of the work that we\u2019re currently working on, the range of activities that he\u2019s been working on as CIA Director. And so I think he\u2019s got such a deep familiarity with so many of these issues from his current position that it will be a very easy transition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn your other question, can you remind me, Josh? I couldn\u2019t \u2013 what was the second part of the question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, the other question was about your bilat with the Iranians. Did you make any progress?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Oh yeah, the bilat with the \u2013 yeah, the bilat with the Iranians, as I said, the only purpose in requesting it was to demand the release of the Americans that they\u2019ve detained. Given the sensitivity of that subject, I don\u2019t want to go beyond what I said, that I requested the meeting and I did have a discussion with them, and that\u2019s as much as I can say on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And can you tell us whether you expect to stay at S/P?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK: </strong>Everyone in the Executive Branch serves at the pleasure of the President, and I am continuing to advance the administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And that question comes from the line of Karen DeYoung, <em>Washington Post.</em> Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Karen, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello? Oh, hi. Thank you. You said that the United States is complying with all of its commitments under the JCPOA, although you mentioned the part that says that they need to pay attention to certain other things. Would you say that they are or are not complying with their commitments under the JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> I would say that they are in \u2013 that they are in technical \u2013 we have not heard \u2013 we go over sanctions and we go over nuclear \u2013 we talked about the nuclear issues, civil nuclear on the agenda for the Joint Commission, and they are in technical \u2013 my understanding is that they are in technical compliance with their commitments under the JCPOA. The Iranians had a number of complaints about licenses, especially around civil aviation licenses to Iran Air and other airlines. And what I said to them was: You use your commercial airlines to move terrorists and weapons around the Middle East, including to Syria, and we will not issue licenses at the expense of our national security. And so I encouraged them to make the kind of reforms to their civil aviation and to their economy that would then put us in a better position. But we are not going to be issuing licenses at the expense of our national security or at the expense of our allies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> That comes from the line of Elise Labott, CNN. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the idea that you just said, that you see that the Iranians are in technical compliance \u2013 and obviously, the Europeans have said the same thing and they don\u2019t want to do a kind of additional supplement to the agreement, but have clearly said to you that they\u2019re willing to work with you on some of these other issues such as the sunset, the ICBM, inspections outside of the contours of a deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering, like, what \u2013 I think this is the basic question that everyone is asking, like what is the point of even withdrawing from the deal if you can deal with these concerns with the Europeans outside of the confines of it? Whereas if you push and you pull out of the deal that they\u2019re not going to work with you on it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then a second part of that is if Iran is in technical compliance of the deal and you\u2019re working towards possible discussions with North Korea on a nuclear deal, what kind of confidence does it give the North Koreans if you\u2019re willing to kind of change the goalposts and say technical compliance is one thing but the spirit of the agreement is another? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks, Elise. I think on the second part, in the context of nonproliferation agreements or treaties, it is very common to add supplemental agreements. START \u2013 New START does not violate START. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a very common practice in arms control to be making adjustments to a nonproliferation agreement as you go along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat\u2019s unique about the JCPOA is that it\u2019s not an arms control treaty. It\u2019s not even an agreement. It\u2019s a plan of action that was agreed to by the prior administration and it doesn\u2019t have the same standing as a treaty would. And so this is a \u2013 I think a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s <em>sui generis</em> nonproliferation plan of action that\u2019s a political document. And this is an agreement that has many deficiencies. We think that these deficiencies are of such threats to national security that we can\u2019t allow the deal to remain in place without a supplemental agreement to address its deficiencies. And so that\u2019s our focus there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of North Korea, when you look at the history of negotiations with North Korea, no one has moved the goalposts or negotiated in more bad faith than North Korea. They have a history of noncompliance, but with the United States, we then stick to the terms of the deal, and we have not had a partner \u2013 we have not had somebody on the other the side of the table in (inaudible) with the Kim family over three generations now who negotiate in good faith. And so we are determined not to make some of the past mistakes again in the context of North Korea, and the maximum pressure campaign continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our next question comes from the line of Michele Kelemen, NPR. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, hi. One quick question about the negotiations with the Europeans: Do you think that whatever supplemental deal is really going to be enough to keep the President inside the JCPOA? And then on this question of the Americans, are you proposing kind of a separate humanitarian channel, is this going to be something more regular, or was this a one-off meeting?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> What we have is the President\u2019s guidance on January 12th where he has explained the conditions that would have to be met to continue waiving sanctions, and those are the instructions we\u2019re operating under. He will have to reach an \u2013 he will have to reach a decision as to \u2013 are we able to \u2013 first we have to reach an agreement with the Europeans, and if we can\u2019t reach an agreement with the Europeans, then we will report that to the President. If we can reach an agreement, then that will be presented to the President by the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor, and then he will make a decision on whether he wants to remain in the deal or stop waiving sanctions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> That comes from the line of Arshad Mohammed of Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for doing this. Has \u2013 have you made any progress in the talks so far with the three European partners on the specific question of the sunsets under the JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: I appreciate you asking the question, but I don\u2019t want to get into the substance of our negotiations. We \u2013 where we have agreement, we are capturing the agreement, and where we have differences, we are working to narrow them to see if we can reach an agreement. And so that\u2019s been the nature of the process. As I\u2019ve said before, we have had very constructive meetings and we are (inaudible) toward reaching an agreement, and we\u2019ll see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Okay. Our next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR</strong>: The next question is from Felicia Schwartz, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Hey, Brian, thanks for doing this. First, should we take your comments earlier on the airline licenses to mean that the Boeing deal is on hold, or perhaps in danger? And then are you discussing contingencies with the Europeans in these meetings at this point if the President does pull out of the deal, since May is not too far away? And what is the status of the legislative fix?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: On the first part about the civil aviation, most of that was related to \u2013 I think that\u2019s related mostly to parts. What I said earlier is not meant to make any commentary or opinion on the other part that you raised. I was just saying that with respect to civil aviation, we are meeting our obligations under the deal in terms of aviation licenses. They have acknowledged that we have not issued any new civil aviation licenses in this administration. The previously issued licenses remain in place, but we never intended to let licensed aircraft contribute to Iran\u2019s regional destabilization effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Felicia, what was the second?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Just \u2013 are you discussing contingencies at this point if the President does decide to pull out, since May is only a few months away? And also, the legislative fix, where does that stand?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: I will defer to Congress on the legislative fix. The President set forth a plan. What the President wants to do is to give Congress a role to address the range of threats that Iran presents. The prior administration did not submit this nonproliferation plan of action to the Senate and bypass the Congress. In this administration, the President is working with the Congress to \u2013 we think one aspect of fixing the Iran deal is giving the role to Congress. The other aspect of it is securing an agreement with our European allies to address its deficiencies. And so those are the \u2013 sort of the two key lines of effort. So that\u2019s really where our focus is.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Okay. We have time for just a couple extra questions. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR</strong>: The next question is from the line of Dave Clark, AFP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Hello, can you hear me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Yep, sure can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Yeah. Hi, Dave Clark here from AFP. I know that our Israeli colleague Barak Ravid is reporting that Israeli officials are saying that President Trump told them that a supplemental agreement would be insufficient, and that he wants the deal itself to be torn up otherwise. He\u2019s thinking of \u2013 he\u2019s thinking of pulling out. I wouldn\u2019t ask you to comment on leaks from another government, but are you clear yourself and are you able to articulate to our European allies what exactly the President\u2019s redlines are? And do you \u2013 are you clear yourself as to what it would take to convince him to stay in the deal? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: Well, I also \u2013 before I answer that, let me just go back to what Felicia asked about contingency planning. The President has, as I said earlier, given us negotiating guidance in his January 12th statement. And so he has asked if we can reach agreement with the Europeans. We always have to prepare for any eventuality, and so we are engaged in contingency planning because it would not be responsible not to engage in it. We are \u2013 we\u2019re kind of dual-tracking this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so on the other question about the meeting with the President, I wouldn\u2019t comment on any sort of discussion that the President had privately with another country. So I don\u2019t really have anything to add there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: And I would --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: No, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: I would just confirm \u2013 excuse me, I would just highlight, Dave, that we haven\u2019t seen that report ourselves from Israel, and so just can\u2019t confirm that that is what anybody from the administration said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: No, but I didn\u2019t ask you to comment on that report, but I just wanted to know if Mr. Hook is himself clear on exactly what the agreement with the Europeans would have to involve for the President to sign off on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK</strong>: The President has identified sunsets, inspections and ICBMs. And so those are the three areas of focus for us, and we have a delegation, a team that is working on this with representatives from the State Department and the White House. We have a very good interagency team that\u2019s working on this to be faithful to the President\u2019s instructions on negotiations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. And we\u2019re going to have to do the last question. Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. I know you had a question, if we can pull you in there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And Nick Wadhams, Bloomberg News, please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks. Can you hear me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yeah, we can hear you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Okay. Can I just ask Brian two quick things? One, how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to reach a deal with the Europeans? Are you hopeful that there is \u2013 that you can cross the finish line on this, or are you skeptical that you\u2019ll be able to reach something?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd also you mentioned that you would need to come to some agreement with the Europeans to present to the President in May. What about Russia, China, and Iran? What if you don\u2019t secure agreement from them before May? Or is the strategy that you would get the European agreement and then take that to the President, and then work on those other parties to the plan of action? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> We have had constructive talks with the Europeans toward a supplemental agreement, but I can\u2019t predict whether we will reach an agreement with them or not. We have a goal in mind, and we either will reach agreement or we won\u2019t.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the second part of the question, the only guidance that we \u2013 that the President gave is to reach an agreement with the E3. And that is the first phase of this, which is through May 12th. And I won\u2019t speculate beyond May 12th, because that is \u2013 that\u2019s as much as our negotiating instructions allow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Thanks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and Brian, thank you for your time. We\u2019ll let you get back to shoveling snow or whatever one does in the suburbs. (Laughter.) The embargo on the call has now been lifted. If anyone has any follow-up questions, PA is staffed, we\u2019re all working, so let us know if you need anything. Brian, thank you, and thank you everybody for your time today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Okay, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay, bye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks so much, everybody. Bye.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Technical questions regarding the details of today\u2019s action should be addressed to the Department of Commerce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe listed entities are a source of substantial revenue for the Government of South Sudan. Unfortunately, the South Sudanese Government, and corrupt official actors, use this revenue to purchase weapons and fund irregular militias that undermine the peace, security, and stability of South Sudan rather than support the welfare and current emergency food needs of the South Sudanese people. We call on the region and broader international community to join us in limiting the financial flows that fuel the continuing violence in the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Government of South Sudan can do better. The United States expects it, as well as the armed opposition, to fulfill their commitments to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and to their own people to cease hostilities, allow unimpeded humanitarian access, and pursue a negotiated peace in good faith. As the largest donor of aid to South Sudan, the United States is proud to uphold humanitarian values and deliver vital assistance. The Government of South Sudan must not squander that generosity and should take concrete steps to provide for the vast needs of the South Sudanese people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday\u2019s actions are part of our ongoing effort to hold to account those who foment violence, commit human rights violations, obstruct the peace process, or engage in illicit financial activities against the interest of the South Sudanese people.

The Secretary is in Kenya for three days as part of his official visit that began at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa and that is heading to a number of African countries, namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Chad, and Nigeria.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOn behalf of His Excellency the President, the government, and the people of Republic of Kenya, and indeed on my own behalf, I take this opportunity to express our utmost gratitude to Secretary Tillerson for his historic visit.

During their meeting, President Kenyatta expressed his satisfaction at the existing strong bilateral cooperation on a wide range of issues and areas. He reaffirmed his commitment to continue working closely with the administration of the United States on matters of mutual interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe discussion focused on priority areas of cooperation, including their shared conviction in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, other transnational crimes, as well as regional peace and security, and more importantly, our economic partnership.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the bilateral front, President Kenyatta shared his focus on the Big Four agenda, which aims at improving livelihoods, creating jobs, and growing the economy of Kenya by focusing on critical areas of our economy in the next five years. He urged the Government of the United States of America to support the implementation of the Big Four and observed with delight the steps taken by a number of American companies, including Bechtel International, to set their African headquarters in Nairobi and their readiness to commence investment in construction of a number of our infrastructure projects. The president also expressed his appreciation that all processes are now complete in readiness for the inaugural direct flight between Nairobi and New York and expressed his optimism in the \u2013 that this flight \u2013 this flight \u2013 direct flight between our countries will boost people-to-people contacts and trade between our countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our exchange of views with Secretary Tillerson, I have reaffirmed and the president as well has reaffirmed Kenya\u2019s commitment to the values of democratic governance, constitutionalism, the rule of law, and human rights. We underscored the importance of respecting established democratic institutions as the basis for entrenching democratic governance across the globe. We noted the exponential growth of trade between our countries and we hope that we can begin to negotiate towards concluding a framework that will succeed AGOA when it comes to an end in 2025.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the regional front, Kenya sits in a fragile region with numerous security threats. We commend the Government of the United States of America for their existing robust partnership and support to us in the area of security, military, and intelligence cooperation. In this area, the president urged and Secretary Tillerson reaffirmed the commitment of the two countries to continue working together in the fight against terrorism, in countering violent extremism, and other security threats. We especially welcome the continued support of the USA to AMISOM. We in Kenya, like other troop-contributing countries, believe in the need for sustained engagement in order to sustain the gains made and to create an enabling environment to turn Somalia around. On South Sudan, we noted the slow progress in the IGAD high-level revitalization process, and we share very deep concerns about this crisis that has impact on large numbers of people. But President Kenyatta reaffirmed Kenya\u2019s continued demonstrated commitment towards our efforts to restore South Sudan to normalcy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn reference to environmental and wildlife conservation, we appreciate the longtime support from the U.S., especially against illegal poaching and trade of wildlife trophies obtained from endangered species, and we continue to urge further U.S. support in this endeavor in order that we can sustain and preserve our common humanity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI wish at this point to thank Secretary Tillerson for this historic visit. We hope he\u2019ll come back again to enjoy the fauna and beauty of our country that we hold in trust for humanity, and we hope that this time he will also take some time to enjoy a little bit of that menu. It is now my honor and pleasure to invite the Secretary of State of the United States to make his remark. Secretary Tillerson, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, thank you so much, Secretary Juma, for the welcome, and congratulations on your recent confirmation to your new position. And I truly enjoyed coming to Kenya and to continuing the work of the United States in this enduring partnership between our two countries. I do want to congratulate President Kenyatta and opposition leader Odinga on their meeting this morning and their joint announcement. This is a very positive step, in our view, and while we know addressing Kenya\u2019s ethnic and political divisions will take some time and effort, today both of these men showed great leadership in coming together in the agreement that they signed today. The United States looks forward to supporting the process that was announced this morning to bring the country together and to address the various national divisions. Kenya is a leader in Africa and a longtime partner of the United States, and we are steadfast in our support for Kenya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTomorrow, on behalf of the American people, I will pay my respects to those who died 20 years ago in the U.S. embassy attacks here and in Dar es Salaam. Tragically, we still are confronted with the face of terrorism. During our meeting today, we discussed threats facing Kenya, Africa, and the global community. The United States appreciates our security partnership with Kenya and our shared fight against terrorism. We recognize the 4,000 Kenyan troops serving in Somalia as part of AMISOM to counter al-Shabaab and bring stability to that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKenya is a country of tremendous opportunity. With a fast-growing GDP at more than 5 percent, a vibrant culture of entrepreneurship, and a regional economic \u2013 and a regional economic leader, we are eager to find more ways to work with you to grow our economic cooperation. In 2016, total trade between our countries was just under $1 billion. I know we can do much more, and we look forward to growing our trading relations. We commend the government\u2019s Big Four economic growth initiative, and look forward to deepening the ties between American and Kenyan business communities to support this effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the secretary already commented on, we shared our concerns during our discussions with the president about the importance of democratic institutions and Kenya as a leading democracy in Africa. We believe that there are actions that need to be taken in Kenya and that they need to correct certain actions, like shutting down TV stations and threatening the independence of the courts. I know Kenya takes these matters seriously. A free and independent media is essential to safeguarding democracy and giving all Kenyans confidence in their government.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States looks forward to growing our comprehensive relationship with Kenya. Our commitment is not to one party, but to all of the Kenyan people. We stand ready to assist Kenyan \u2013 Kenya and the Kenyan people as they move forward on what we know will be a very bright future. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Your Excellencies will take a few questions. I want to ask (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Karibu Kenya, Secretary Tillerson. Given the timing of the commitment to unity by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga \u2013 (inaudible) preceded your arrival \u2013 did the U.S. have anything to do with that mediation? And as mentioned by Secretary Monica Juma, the U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to Kenya\u2019s security \u2013 sorry, to collaborating with Kenya in the area of security, as well as growing trade. But what about the other programs, such as PEPFAR, Power Africa, YALI, and AGOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think the U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period. And we were very, very encouraged and pleased to see the two leaders come together today. But I think we really want to give them the credit. This was a very important, I think, action on their part to show that they\u2019re ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans regardless of party and begin to really take this long journey that\u2019s necessary to restore the country, eliminate these divisions that are creating obstacles to Kenya\u2019s future. And so I really \u2013 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning that came together in a very important agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We have another question from AP. (Inaudible.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Madame Cabinet Secretary \u2013 (inaudible) microphone? Madame Cabinet Secretary, could you respond to the Secretary\u2019s remarks, and can Kenya truly call itself a democracy in light of the severe restrictions imposed on free media in the country, starting with the silencing of television outlets, the firing of editors, and pressure on news outlets to stifle criticism of the government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Secretary, can you talk a little bit about the fact that your administration has been running the government for more than a year now and we still see vacancies in key administration posts, including assistant and under secretaries, also including the North Korean envoy? What\u2019s taking so long to fill these posts and what\u2019s your response to allegations that some posts are being left unfilled intentionally? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JUMA</strong>: Let me respond to the question around the media, because I think this has been played up significantly. First of all, I think the definition of democracy goes way beyond the media, but also the provision of free press in this country is secured within our constitution. And the incident that is being referenced here is a one-off incident. It\u2019s an incident that affected three of more than tens of TV stations in this country. It is a matter that involved investigation of the police, and you will know, if you operate in this environment, that we have perhaps the largest media corps anywhere on this African continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the notion that there is a restriction of the media in Kenya is actually not backed by fact and reality. In this country, I think it is important for me to emphasize that we bestowed upon ourselves a progressive constitution because we believed that only that constitution, only those liberties, only those privileges guaranteed by the constitution would help us to realize our full potential as a country. And that involves a whole range of rights and protection of institutions beyond the media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have to say this, that since this process began, the start of that new constitution, which was three decades ago, up and until 2010, when we promulgated the 2010 constitution, and from 2010 to today, including in the event that Secretary of State was referencing this morning, are all indications of our fidelity to our aspiration to deepen our democratic credentials. And therefore, I want to put it to everyone here that the democratic project in this country is on the right trajectory, and it is not under any form of threat whatsoever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think this is a question you\u2019re probably going to be asking the day the end of the first term of this administration ends. We have a number of nominees in the system, as you well know. We have \u2013 we\u2019ve had a number that have been confirmed this year. There are several waiting on their hearings to be scheduled before the relevant committees. But as you well know, the process is a fairly rigorous one, from the time we select an individual, they agree to serve, to go through their clearance processes, to go through the clearance both from a standpoint of security but also the clearance with the White House process, and then make their way over to be nominated directly for consideration by the confirmation by the Senate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd along that way, not surprisingly, sometimes things come up and people decide they want to proceed any further, or things come up that disqualify individuals. That\u2019s why we have a clearance process. It\u2019s an important element of the whole process of naming and confirming people so that when they are confirmed and they\u2019re ready to serve, there\u2019s no question that they meet all the qualifications as well. And when that happens, we have to start the process over, and that\u2019s happened to us on a number of occasions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think with respect to the open positions \u2013 I\u2019ve said this many, many times; I\u2019m going to stick with what I\u2019ve said and stand by it \u2013 I think if you look at the results that we\u2019re getting in very important policy areas, and you mentioned North Korea, and the open positions we have there, I think as we\u2019ve seen in the last 24 hours, the policy that was put in place and has been executed by the State Department over the past year has succeeded. And we\u2019ve done that in spite of the fact that we have people serving in acting positions in some cases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as I\u2019ve said many times, I don\u2019t lose a wink of sleep over the fact that we may not have our nominees in the position because we have very capable, skilled, career diplomats ready to step up and serve in those positions. And they are serving superbly, and we are moving the policies forward, and nothing is being held up because the positions are open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWould I like to have them filled? Of course I would like to have them filled, because it\u2019s easier on everyone, including our career people, and some of the career people that are waiting for confirmation. It\u2019s a very different matter to be Senate-confirmed versus in an acting role, and we know that. But having said that, I am very, very proud of the State Department and the work that we\u2019re getting done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>One final question from Ferdinand Omondi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. It\u2019s Ferdinand from the BBC. The United Nations accuses Kenya and Uganda of aiding the conflict in South Sudan by supplying arms at a time when the U.S. is pushing South Sudan\u2019s neighbors to enforce an arms embargo. What is the U.S. position in this, and what actions, if any, are being taken?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON</strong>: Well, the U.S. believes that the arms embargo should be enforced, and that\u2019s \u2013 our position has been very clear on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JUMA:</strong> I also have to state here that Kenya is not involved in any supply of arms to any of the parties. For the longest period of time, Kenya has been involved in the search for peace in South Sudan, and it would be foolhardy that we would invest in the search for peace while at the same time arming parties to that conflict. We take the first unintended consequences, including large numbers of refugees that are already flowing into our territories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I have to make it abundantly clear that Kenya has no intention of exacerbating that conflict, that Kenya is engaged in terms of efforts to normalize South Sudan, and it is not in our policy or our intention to get involved in supplying arms to either South Sudan or any other country for that matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you, Your Excellencies. And that concludes \u2013 that\u2019s the end of this press briefing. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

We will continue to implement measures to strengthen the economic empowerment of women and girls through policies and programs that promote entrepreneurship as well as broaden equal access to finance, decent work, training, and learning opportunities. We will build upon the success of women who have paved the way for more equality in the fields of defense, peacebuilding, and good governance, and work to solidify gains in these areas. We want to see more girls able to aspire to their full potential and to ensure they live in safe, healthy, and secure environments. Thus, we strive to create and invest in opportunities to enable girls to attain the education and freedoms they deserve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is committed to working with governments and partners around the globe to ensure that countries everywhere enable women to thrive and realize their rights. In the 21st century, it is unconscionable that about one in three women has experienced some form of physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Far too many societies still deprive women of their human rights, discriminate based upon sex, pose obstacles to women\u2019s ability to contribute to economic development, or fail to uphold the laws intended to protect them. Such conditions deprive individuals, families, and communities of the contributions that empowered women can provide. As the U.S. National Security Strategy has asserted, governments that fail to treat women equally do not allow their societies to reach their full potential.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the spirit of International Women\u2019s Day, we recognize the leadership, contributions, and courage of women who have made sacrifices in the past, over many generations, to make the world a more safe, prosperous, and peaceful place.

May we rise, please? I thank you very much. <i>Ameseginalehu</i>. Your Excellency Dr. Workneh Gebeyehu, foreign minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; Your Excellency Rex Wayne Tillerson, U.S. Secretary of State; ambassadors, ministers, all protocol observed, welcome to Addis Ababa, the political and diplomatic hub of Africa.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs His Excellency Minister Tillerson said during his speech at George Mason University, Africa is part of the future. It\u2019s a continent in which 70 percent of its population is youth. This population, Your Excellency, is an opportunity and, again, a challenge. Ethiopia, as a UN-U.S. partner and longer in the continent, I believe this extraordinary visit will further deepen the ties of Ethiopia and the United States, one of the oldest diplomatic ties.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAccording to our program, His Excellency Dr. Workneh and His Excellency Rex Tillerson will highlight the gist of their discussions to the media, and that will be followed by questions from media houses. Media houses, make sure that you have one questions. If it is more than one, the two principals will ask \u2013 will respond to one question only.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI thank you very much. Excellency Dr. Workneh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER WORKNEH: </b>Thank you very much. Thank you. Good afternoon. The house is full. Your Excellency Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State of the United States of America, we are delighted to have you here in your visit to Africa as a first stop here in Addis Ababa. United States and Ethiopia have a century-old relationship, a relationship which, time-tested, always a relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Your Excellency, your coming here is a testament for this strong relationship. I and Excellency Secretary discussed extensive issues bilaterally. We discussed about our regional issues \u2013 the regional security, international issues, international politics \u2013 at the same time, how to boost our economic ties and investment between the United States of America and Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe touched about the issue of South Sudan and Somalia, which we are working very closely together. And also, we discussed other very important security concerns that we have in common. And also, I explained to Excellency about our situation, the country\u2019s situation, the transition that we are in the process, and we are very thankful that the United States of America is a close friend, which \u2013 working with us in all aspects, especially in economic areas. So it was very cordial, candid, and very fruitful discussion. And thank you so much, Your Excellency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, thank you as well, Excellency, for the warm welcome and hospitality. And we just had a very enjoyable lunch where we were able to continue our discussion with a number of members of both of our delegations, which is always useful to gain a greater understanding of each other. I also want to welcome both the local press and the foreign media as well to this event. And we do appreciate our partnership, and particularly at such a critical time for Ethiopia. I also look forward to my meeting later today with the prime minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m quite excited to be in Ethiopia. This is my first visit, and certainly this was an important place to start my trip as Secretary of State to the continent, in large measure because of the more than 100-year diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the United States. And it\u2019s been an enduring relationship; as the foreign minister described it, an all-weather relationship, that even when storm clouds gather we remain friends and have always worked through challenges together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also want to acknowledge again today this being International Women\u2019s Day and an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women across the world, and note the role of women in Ethiopia in promoting economic growth as well. It\u2019s quite evident the prominence that women already occupy in government, but in economics as well, strengthening the rule of law, the important role they play in human rights and building and strengthening a civil society that will thrive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I indicated, the United States and Ethiopia are longstanding partners. I was glad to have the opportunity to exchange views with the foreign minister on many areas of mutual interest that we share. We recognize and share concerns expressed by the government about incidents of violence and loss of life. We do firmly believe the answer is greater freedom for people, not less. We recognize the transition that is underway in Ethiopia, the first-ever voluntary transfer of power. And I view this as a very positive symbol of the strength of this very young democracy in Ethiopia, a peaceful transition of power.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGiven recent events, the United States has expressed our concerns with the government\u2019s decision to impose another state of emergency, because it does put restrictions on fundamental rights like assembly and expression. We also discussed in our exchange the importance of ensuring that security forces remain disciplined in maintaining law and order, preventing violence. They have a very difficult challenge on their hand. This is \u2013 this tests their own discipline as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe firmly believe that democratic reform, economic growth, and lasting stability are best addressed through an inclusive political process, rather than through the imposition of restrictions. And we encourage the Ethiopian people as well to maintain patience, maintain support for your government through this change, through this transition, but also in pursuing this journey of democracy, which takes time and effort. Democracy is not easy. It takes a lot of work. But staying with it, lasting change will come about, and to not resort to violence. Violence is simply never a solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI was able to raise these concerns because of this very, very strong relationship that exists between Ethiopia and the United States, and we share so many values as partners. We want Ethiopia as a country to succeed and prosper, and we\u2019re confident that they will succeed and prosper, providing many, many economic benefits not just for the Ethiopian people, but for the neighboring countries in Africa, and ultimately for U.S. business interest as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe welcome the proactive steps that have already been taken with the release of thousands of prisoners, including journalists and political leaders, and we encourage additional concrete measures to allow greater political freedom of expression. As the seat of the African Union, Ethiopia plays a critical and significant role in leadership in the region throughout the continent and the world, and we appreciate its efforts for \u2013 to further our mutual goals of peace and prosperity on the continent. This is especially true of our shared security interests. As the largest contributor \u2013 Ethiopia is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations \u2013 they play a vital role in AMISOM in Somalia, as well as peacekeeping efforts in Sudan and South Sudan. We have shared treasure together in trying to advance the cause of peace, and we have shared blood together in this advance for the cause of peace, and we acknowledge that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEthiopia\u2019s influence in supporting the security of Somalia and Djibouti are particularly important at this time to keep global commerce routes open. These routes through the Red Sea affect billions of people around the world in terms of their economic stability. And we discussed the United States is eager to help Ethiopia liberalize its economy. We think it\u2019s going to bring great opportunity and attract many business interests as they continue the process of reform and liberalization, strengthen its judicial and commercial institutions, and assist in humanitarian emergencies here and throughout the region, including the almost one million refugees that currently reside in Ethiopia. And we need to reside \u2013 recognize Ethiopia\u2019s generosity in hosting those refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is a long-term friend and partner of Ethiopia. We look forward to working with you as the people of Ethiopia seek greater peace, democracy and prosperity, all of which we know you will succeed at achieving. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you so much, excellencies. Now, back to the media. Tibebu Yared from EBC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you very much. I am Tibebu from EBC. My question goes to Your Excellency Mr. Tillerson. What is the purpose and, of course, the implication of your visit to Ethiopia at this particular time? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, as I indicated, this is a very, very longstanding relationship, more than 100 years. Ethiopia is a large-population country, they are an important security partner in areas that I\u2019ve already touched upon, and we also see Ethiopia\u2019s journey towards democracy \u2013 I think 27 years now, which is a long time, but it\u2019s a young democracy, and as I indicated, democracies are challenging. It\u2019s not easy to take a country forward as a democracy. And so we\u2019re here also to support Ethiopia\u2019s journey towards a democratic society and institutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut importantly, also, to have an exchange on additional steps that could be taken, what else can the U.S. do to be supportive and helpful of Ethiopia\u2019s economic development. Ethiopia has a vibrant economy, but there\u2019s a lot of potential that has yet to be realized in Ethiopia\u2019s economy, and we think there are great opportunities for U.S. private sector engagement in supporting economic growth, creating jobs for these many, many millions of young people who are working hard at getting an education in school; now they want to have their opportunity for a future themselves. And so we would like \u2013 we want to be a part of that and hope to be a part of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there are so many touch points where we share a common interest of security, stability for the region, which affects our security but also affects global security, and then opportunities for economic prosperity. And that\u2019s the purpose of the trip, is to \u2013 for us to better understand how do we work together as partners to achieve what are really common aspirations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Next question, Sisay Woubeshet, Afro FM. I am trying to meet gender parity. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. My question also goes to Secretary Tillerson. You came during the time of the second state of emergency here in Ethiopia, and what is your opinion towards the state of emergency, as many nations are opining on that? And how is the U.S. following the current political situation in Ethiopia and what role does it want to play? Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Well, as I indicated, first and foremost, I want to acknowledge this voluntary transfer of power. We think that\u2019s a very powerful symbol to the strength of the democratic process here in Ethiopia, and we think it\u2019s important that the parliament, which has been elected by the Ethiopian people, decide who the next leadership be. That\u2019s the way democracies should perform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I want to first acknowledge the very positive aspects of what is happening. I know it\u2019s challenging for the country. It creates uncertainty. And that is the hard part of democracy. But we support this peaceful transfer of power.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs to the state of emergency, as I indicated, we believe ultimately giving people greater freedom gives them a greater investment in this democracy as well. And so while we appreciate the government\u2019s responsibility to maintain control and not allow violence to break out and harm innocent people as well who may become victims of violence, it is important that that \u2013 that the country move on past the state of emergency as quickly as possible. We hope that that can occur. As I said, we\u2019re encouraged that a number of steps have been taken to release large numbers of people who have been detained. That\u2019s an important step. But the citizens of Ethiopia have a responsibility as well to behave in a nonviolent way, and we hope the government allows that nonviolent expression to take place. This is all part of understanding how to best serve the citizens of Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you very much. Girum Chala from CGTN, international correspondent based in Addis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. I\u2019m from CGTN. Mr. Minister, thank you very much, as well as Mr. Secretary. Ethiopian Airlines over the past few years has spent about $20 billion \u2013 that\u2019s Ethiopian money \u2013 invested in the United States, in Boeing Company, to be particularly straightforward. Now, when it comes to those \u2013 the money spent, 100,000-plus jobs were created in the United States. When it comes to the investments of the United States to Africa, Ethiopia particularly, we don\u2019t see much. Policy-wise, what\u2019s the next move in this country and particularly also in the African continent to expedite investment? And how do you view, Mr. Minister, the expectation from Ethiopia\u2019s side, the U.S. involvement in helping the country industrialize and even more trade internationally? Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Well, we had a very robust discussion of economic opportunities and the potential economic opportunities that we see within Ethiopia. And because you mentioned the aviation connection, Ethiopia is becoming a critical hub for intercontinental traffic for people traveling from the United States, with more and more nonstop connections for Americans to travel to Addis Ababa and then make connections to other parts of the continent. I think this is going to promote a great deal of interest in Africa and in Ethiopia. There are still economic reform measures that are necessary, not just in Ethiopia, but in other parts of Africa as well, to lower some of the barriers to investment, create greater certainty to outside business investors, strong rule of law, good regulatory processes. The more privatization of holdings as possible creates opportunities. But we understand this is all part of governments in transitions, economies in transitions, but that\u2019s what we encourage, is what are the areas of opportunity where we believe there will be strong interest in U.S. companies to participate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI commented on, in our discussions, the what we understand soon-to-be-completed continental free trade agreement, and we believe stimulating intra-continental economic activity and trade from countries on the continent is actually going to create even more opportunity for inbound foreign investment, and certainly U.S. business interest, in wanting to be a part of the intra-continental trading system as well. Similarly, with the civil aviation agreement that\u2019s being negotiated through the African Union. That once again is going to just tie the continent more closely together, more efficiently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these are very positive conditions for outside businesses to want to participate and be a part of. So I think a number of very positive steps are being taken, and I think it\u2019s really ensuring that American businessmen and investors understand what are the opportunities here. And we had discussions about how to do that as well. Recently creating an American Chamber of Commerce-Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce partnership is going to be very important to exposing American businesses to the opportunities here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think there\u2019s a lot of it in front of us yet to come, and as the conditions are created and some of these pieces come into place, I think American business and private sector interest is going to grow in Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER WORKNEH: </b>Yeah. As Secretary has said, the issue of investment and trade is also one of the agendas that we have discussed with Secretary Tillerson. Africa is a future continent, as Secretary said, and Africa is a population who have more than 70 percent of users and skilled labor. So coming to Africa is, by all measurements, will benefit the business, the investment of America. So we are expecting more investors to come to Ethiopia and Africa; we are expecting more business from here to United States of America and from America to Ethiopia. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest airline who have the largest passengers from here, from Africa to United States of America and vice versa. This trade relationship will continue, and we hope that this visit also assists a lot to this \u2013 boosting this investment in trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Last question. Kylie Atwood, CBS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you. Secretary Tillerson, I want to pivot to North Korea for a minute with you. South Korea now says that Kim Jong-un is willing to negotiate with the U.S. on abandoning his nuclear program. You\u2019ve said that you are listening to North Korea, and you said that the message from them will come very explicitly. Is this the message that you needed to hear? And are you worried that the South Koreans are overeager? Can the U.S. now commit to negotiations with North Korea? And I have to ask you one more question about Russia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Only one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I got cut off last time. Can I ask one more? Thank you. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is said to be here in Ethiopia at the same time as you, and the Russian embassy says he\u2019s actually staying at this same hotel. He says there have been talks of you and he meeting. Do you plan to meet with him while you\u2019re here? And if not, what does that say about U.S. diplomacy, that you refuse an opportunity to meet face to face to express U.S. frustrations over Russia\u2019s continued military campaign in Syria? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>I think there\u2019s five or six questions in there. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m sorry, but we had to do it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>First, with respect to North Korea, I think, as President Trump has indicated, potentially positive signals coming from North Korea by way of their intra-Korean dialogue with South Korea. We maintain very, very close communication with President Moon of the Republic of Korea. They are keeping us well informed of their meetings, the content of those meetings and the nature of those meetings, and we\u2019re providing them input as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of direct talks with the United States \u2013 and you asked negotiations, and we\u2019re a long ways from negotiations. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it. I think the first step \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this before \u2013 is to have talks, have some kind of talks about talks, because I don\u2019t know yet, until we are able to meet ourselves face to face with representatives of North Korea, whether the conditions are right to even begin thinking about negotiations. And that\u2019s kind of the current state of play.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to my meeting Foreign Minister Lavrov, I\u2019ve lost track of how many meetings he and I had last year. So any notion of us rejecting diplomatic engagement is really silly. That\u2019s just silly. We have had extensive negotiations, contact, dialogue. We have strategic dialogues. We have a number of mechanisms by which we talk to one another. I was unaware Foreign Minister Lavrov was going to be here at the same time I was until a couple of days ago, and I\u2019m unaware of any outreach to want to meet until I was on my way over here. My schedule\u2019s largely set, so if it doesn\u2019t work out here, he and I see each other often around the world, and we have each other\u2019s telephone numbers, and we do use them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you. I thank you, excellencies. Thank you, media houses. Your Excellency Tillerson said that this is his first visit, but I hope this will not be his last visit to Ethiopia. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for being with us today for a very, very special presentation. I\u2019m honored to welcome our Secretary of State to George Mason, who, as you know, is on his way to a very important trip to Africa. And I\u2019m slightly biased, but I think his choice of George Mason for this presentation couldn\u2019t be any better.\n\n\n<p>\n\tGeorge Mason is the home to students and faculty from over 130 countries, and we have made it as part of our mission to make sure that we are educating students to engage in a very interconnected world. We sometimes define ourselves as wanting to be a university for the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, who\u2019s now beginning his second year on the job, obviously, who was not a politician or a government person by training, and yet there are aspects of his career when you think about it make him absolutely perfect for this job assignment. You know that he ran ExxonMobil for a number of years, since 2006 until 2017. You know that Exxon is one of the largest publicly-held companies in the world and one of the most global companies. So yeah, it is pretty intimidating to run the State Department with over 44,000 employees, plus another 44,000 local employees all over the world, and a $50-plus billion budget. But that\u2019s actually smaller than what he used to run when he was at the helm of ExxonMobil. Plus he has spent a lot of time around the world running operations in the Middle East and in many other parts of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMost importantly, I think for this job, is that he was an Eagle Scout. And being a Boy Scout not only prepared him very well, but it marked him so much that he decided to serve the organization. And his \u2013 he served as president of the Boy Scouts of America for a number of years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo again, on behalf of the Mason community and without much more to say, just please join me in welcoming our Secretary of State, Mr. Rex Tillerson. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Thank you. Thank you so much, Dr. Cabrera, for the warm welcome. And it is a pleasure to be here at George Mason, and I\u2019m pleased always to meet a Fulbright alum, as well as a fellow engineer. And we appreciate George Mason University hosting the African and African American Studies program here and for the work it does on many, many important topics that we\u2019ll be discussing this morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLater today I will be leaving on my first official visit to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 not my first visit to Africa, as I made many, many trips and many visits during my past career, but it\u2019s a trip that really began its planning and originated back in November following a ministerial of 37 African nations and the African Union hosted at the State Department. Our conversation during that summit focused on counterterrorism, democracy and governance issues, and strengthening trade and investment ties with the continent \u2013 and these are all themes that I\u2019ll address in a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I said, in my previous life, I spent quite a bit of time in Africa. And my firm belief is that there is ample opportunity on the continent \u2013 for economic growth, for greater prosperity, and for responding to global challenges through mutually respectful partnerships. I do look forward to returning and building on a strong foundation of U.S.-Africa relations. And that includes visiting Chad, a country that has never before welcomed a visit by the Secretary of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past century, as African nations emerged from their colonial past, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in America\u2019s engagement with Africa. The State Department created the Africa Bureau in 1958 \u2013 a year following then-Vice President Richard Nixon\u2019s trip to the continent. Ghana had invited the Vice President and Martin Luther King, Jr. to attend their independence day celebration \u2013 an event that took place exactly 61 years ago today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few years later, President John F. Kennedy established USAID with an eye toward African development, and our first Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Ghana and Tanzania. Forty years ago this month, President Jimmy Carter visited Liberia and Nigeria, where he announced that \u201cour nation has now turned in an unprecedented way toward Africa.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday that turning continues. Our country\u2019s security and economic prosperity are linked with Africa\u2019s like never before. That will only intensify in the coming decades for the following reasons:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst: A major demographic shift. By the year 2030, Africa will represent about one quarter of the world\u2019s workforce. And by the year 2050, the population of the continent is expected to double to more than 2.5 billion people \u2013 with 70 percent of them under the age of 30.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second: Africa is experiencing significant economic growth. The World Bank estimates that six of the ten fastest growing economies in the world this year will be African.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor context, by the year 2050, Nigeria will have a population larger than the United States and an economy larger than Australia\u2019s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo understand where the world is going, one must understand that Africa is a significant part of the future. African countries will factor more and more into numerous global security and development challenges, as well as expansive opportunities for economic growth and influence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile Africa contains a wealth of diversity \u2013 among its peoples, its cultures, and its governments \u2013 there are common challenges and opportunities. Africa\u2019s vitality is reflected in its youth, but a growing population of young people means a requirement for more jobs. As more Africans move out of poverty, nations will require more infrastructure and development. The growing population of young people, if left without jobs and a hope for the future, will create new ways for terrorists to exploit the next generation, subverting stability and derailing democratic governments. Leaders will be challenged to innovate and to manage the limited financial resources they have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we look ahead, this administration seeks to deepen our partnership with Africa, with an aim of making African countries more resilient and more self-sufficient. That serves our partners, and it serves the United States as well by creating a stable future for all of our children and our grandchildren.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe future of stability is dependent on security \u2013 the condition that is necessary for economic prosperity and strong institutions. Without it, none of the other pieces can be put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the long reach of terrorism threatens to steal the future of countless individuals. This August, we will remember the hundreds of lives lost 20 years ago in the U.S. embassy attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam \u2013 where hundreds of lives ended.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSince that day, thousands more have died at the hands of terrorists in Africa. Terrorist attacks rose from less than 300 in 2009, to more than 1,500 in each of the years 2015, 2016, and \u201917. And more recently, we witnessed again the heartbreak of the abduction of more than 100 Nigerian schoolgirls \u2013 ripped from their families, forever changing their future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast week, in response to this growing threat, I designated and the United States sanctioned seven ISIS-affiliated groups, including ISIS-West Africa and ISIS-Somalia and their leaders in an effort to cut off the resources that these groups use to carry out attacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo prevail against such evil forces, the United States has committed to working with African partners to rid the continent and the world of terrorism by addressing the drivers of conflict that lead to radicalization and recruitment in the first place, and building the institutional law enforcement capacity of African nations. We want to help Africa states provide security for their citizens in a lawful manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday African nations are stepping up to take action, including the sacrifices that go with such commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTerrorism knows no borders. In the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram, ISIS-West Africa, al-Qaida in the Maghreb and other groups are adaptable, they\u2019re resilient, and capable of launching attacks throughout the area. Regional cooperation is crucial to disrupting those attacks and denying them the capability to plan and carry them out in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Multinational Joint Task Force \u2013 created by Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Benin, and Cameroon \u2013 along with the Group of Five Sahel nations, or the G5 \u2013 Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger \u2013 are pooling expertise and resources. Their work is instrumental in achieving African-led solutions to terrorism and instability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast October, I announced that the United States would contribute more to these regional efforts. We committed up to $60 million toward the G5\u2019s counterterrorism efforts \u2013 to enable them to train and equip members of the Joint Force and counter terrorist propaganda throughout these communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition, for more than a decade, the United States has supported the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership to provide training and promote cooperation between military, law enforcement, and civil actors across North and West Africa. We have deployed a similar approach in East Africa, with the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism, or PREACT. Since 2016, the United States has contributed more than $140 million to help partners prevent terrorist safe havens and the recruitment through these partnerships.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is grateful for the African Union\u2019s leadership in a growing, multilateral role. The AU Mission in Somalia \u2013 or AMISOM \u2013 includes troops from five African countries, stabilizing areas under attack from al-Shabaab and permitting much needed aid to reach the Somali people. I look forward to meeting with AU Commission Chairperson Faki on my upcoming trip to explore more ways in which we can work together to counter terrorism on the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States\u2019 role in these and other regional and multilateral efforts is to build capacity \u2013 not dependency \u2013 so our partners can provide for their own security. That\u2019s true of our approach to peacekeeping on the continent as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the largest contributor of peacekeeping capacity-building in Africa, the United States trains, deploys, and sustains forces that provide counterterrorism support, remove landmines, and facilitate peaceful transitions of power. This creates security, allows health \u2013 excuse me \u2013 allows health, food, and other services to reach areas of need.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast year, the United States supported more than 27,000 African peacekeepers from over 20 African countries. Here too more African countries have taken ownership of their future. A decade ago, Africans made up only about 20 percent of peacekeeping forces on the continent. Today that number exceeds 50 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we support important security efforts, we must work to find long-term diplomatic solutions to conflicts that cause so much human suffering. Until we do, the United States, as the world\u2019s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, will continue to stand with those most vulnerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a testament to that commitment, today I\u2019m announcing $533 million in additional humanitarian assistance to fight famine and food insecurity and address other needs resulting from conflicts in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Lake Chad Basin. The alarming levels of hunger in these areas are largely man-made, as conflicts erupt and people flee their homes. Under these conditions, people cannot produce crops and often lose access altogether to food, education, and health care. Many lose everything. And regrettably, Mother Nature can still be cruel, such as in the Horn of Africa, where a prolonged drought is contributing to grave food insecurity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese additional funds will provide emergency food, nutrition assistance, and other aid, including safe drinking water, thousands of tons of food, and deliver health programs to prevent the spread of deadly diseases like cholera to millions of people. This will save lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe American people, as we always have been, are there to partner with African countries to ensure their most vulnerable populations receive life-saving assistance. We also call upon others to join us in meeting the growing humanitarian needs in Africa. We hope these initial contributions will encourage others to contribute aid to increase burden sharing and meet the growing humanitarian needs in Africa. However, this assistance will not solve these ongoing conflicts, but only buy us time \u2013 time to pursue diplomatic solutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs many African countries assume greater responsibility to address their needs at home, the United States needs our partners in Africa to take an active role on the global stage as well. One area where we seek greater cooperation is our peaceful pressure campaign to bring the DPRK to the negotiating table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNorth Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, including its arms exports to Africa. It doesn\u2019t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia. It doesn\u2019t just include countries with longstanding ties to the DPRK, like China and Russia. This is and must be a global effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast month, during my trip to South America, I spoke candidly with my counterparts about ways they are actively working to contribute to this pressure campaign. Nations in Africa need to do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAngola and Senegal have taken steps to exert some diplomatic and economic pressure. The Ethiopian Government has made public commitments of support as well. But many African nations are holding back. We hope they will add their voices to that of the international community and end these diplomatic, economic, or weapons programs with the regime in North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecurity on the continent is a prerequisite for greater prosperity. And greater stability will, of course, attract greater United States trade and investment with African nations, leading to further development, building on what we have accomplished through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAGOA has been the cornerstone of U.S. trade policy in Africa for almost two decades now. And with AGOA, we\u2019ve seen a lot of progress. Total non-oil goods trade has more than doubled from $13 billion a year to almost $30 billion a year. In fact, last year, total U.S. trade climbed to $38.5 billion, up from $33 billion in 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re encouraged by the actions of many of our African partners who are seeking ways to expand trade with the United States. On his trip to the United States last week, President Akufo-Addo of Ghana addressed the National Governors Association, the first African president to do so. He talked about his desire \u2013 his people\u2019s desire \u2013 to transition from poverty to prosperity in a generation. The United States wants to help enable the public and private sectors in Africa and here at home to make that a reality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfrica still has vast, undeveloped natural resources. Private sector expertise in the United States can facilitate the responsible development of those resources, helping bring more Africans out of poverty to share in the economic values of those resources. But significant transcontinental infrastructure is necessary to support the development, spur economic growth, and boost intraregional trade on the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday only about 12 percent of total African exports are delivered to their neighboring countries on the continent. Compare that to 25 percent among ASEAN countries and more than 60 percent in Europe, and the potential for more economic prosperity through trade on the continent itself is quite evident. As African nations achieve greater regional integration through lowering tariff barriers and improving transport, energy, and infrastructure links, that will create more opportunities for U.S. businesses, investment, and transatlantic trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd importing American business practices and expertise provides the best combination for Africa\u2019s future by contributing to economic prosperity, equipping African nations with new capabilities, and doing so in an open, transparent framework. That is why we want to create the new development finance institution. DFIs are specialized government banks designed to support private sector development to improve development effectiveness. We\u2019re working with Congress to give the United States the ability to compete with countries that already utilize finance to achieve their goals in the developing world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPower Africa, a USAID-led program, is one of the largest public-private partnerships in the continent\u2019s development history. Established five years ago, Power Africa was created to provide African countries access to one of the most basic needs for development: electricity. Today tens of millions of Africans \u2013 across Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 have access to electricity in part because of commitments from more than 140 private sector partners. Our aim is to provide 30,000 megawatts of power by the year 2030 \u2013 or 60 million new connections \u2013 to reach 300 million Africans. Administrator Green announced Power Africa 2.0 just last week to expand even more power opportunities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is eager to reduce barriers to trade and investment with our African partners, helping African countries transition from dependency toward self-sufficiency, growing their middle class, and better integrating African economies with the rest of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo prepare for the future and realize the continent\u2019s potential requires an educated and a healthy workforce. This is true all over the world, but it takes on even more urgency, given Africa\u2019s expanding youth population.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Young Africans Leaders Initiative is one way the State Department and USAID are investing in the next generation of African leaders. YALI provides leadership and professional development training to up-and-coming African leaders on the importance of a free press, how to build more resilient institutions, and even how to start a business. Today, YALI has over 500,000 members and representatives from every Sub-Saharan country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThrough the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, better known as PEPFAR, the United States has transformed the global HIV/AIDS response. And nowhere is this more evident than in Africa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen PEPFAR began 15 years ago, an HIV diagnosis was a death sentence. In the hardest-hit parts of Africa, infant mortality had doubled, child mortality had tripled, and life expectancy had dropped by 20 years. One in three adults were living with HIV. Millions of orphans were left behind. And only 50,000 people were receiving HIV treatments. Today, the American people, through PEPFAR, have provided lifesaving treatments to over 13.3 million men, women, and children. It has allowed more than 2.2 million babies to be born HIV-free and continues to support more than 6.4 million orphans, vulnerable children, and their caregivers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis administration is committed to saving lives in Africa. Last September, I announced the PEPFAR Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control for 2017 to 2020. The strategy is a roadmap to achieve epidemic control in more than 50 countries within three years. It outlines a path to accelerate our work in 12 high-HIV-burden countries in Africa who are poised to achieve epidemic control by 2020. We can actually now see a future free of HIV/AIDS. It\u2019s just ahead of us, and that\u2019s critical to Africa\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor security, trade and investment, and economic development to sustain itself requires effective and accountable government institutions that earn the trust and support of their citizens. Peace and prosperity are only possible in a democratic society. Media freedom, open communications, religious freedom, and a vibrant civil society foster creativity, ideas, and the human energy for economic growth. Today, Africa has much to gain by creating stronger, more transparent, democratic institutions that reflect their citizens\u2019 voices, that reject corruption, and protect and promote human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe African Union estimates that Africa has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to corruption \u2013 hundreds of billions that was not invested in education, infrastructure, or security. Bribes and corruption keep people in poverty. They encourage inequality and they undercut the citizens\u2019 faith in their own government. Legitimate investment stays away, and insecurity and instability grows, creating conditions ripe for terrorism and conflict. We strongly support the African Union\u2019s summit\u2019s highlighting and encouraging efforts on \u201cWinning the Fight Against Corruption.\u201d We hope this year\u2019s theme is only the beginning of a more sustained, long-term focus on anti-corruption.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn support of this theme, the United States will continue its work with African countries to strengthen their democratic institutions. Last month, the State Department requested $137 million from Congress to support democracy, human rights, and government programs to create more transparent, less corrupt institutions that value consensus building over conflict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDemocracy requires transitions of power through free and fair elections. It also needs a vibrant civil society and independent media to help inform citizens and keep them connected to their government. Last year, the United States helped support free and peaceful elections in Liberia, a country that hadn\u2019t experienced a peaceful transition of power in decades. That included civic and voter education programs with a focus on youth, women, and other hard-to-reach, first-time voters, and working with media to promote responsible reporting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the Fiscal Transparency Initiative Fund<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> helps governments create more transparent, publicly available budgets, and equips civil society to advocate for areas of improvement. The United States is currently working on 31 projects \u2013 and is about to award nine more \u2013 throughout Africa. Already, the Financial Transparency Initiative Fund<a name=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> has helped Kenya, Chad, and Malawi develop measures to fight bribery and better serve their own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also keep good governance initiatives in mind when it comes to development. As Secretary of State, I am chairman of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, or MCC. Through this agency designed to reduce poverty, the United States is able to incentivize good governance \u2013 including greater transparency \u2013 by tying it to development assistance. And about 60 percent of MCC\u2019s funding goes to Africa. Last November, we signed a $524 million compact with Cote d\u2019Ivoire to improve its education and transportation sectors. This was only possible after the country had implemented policies to strengthen economic freedom, democratic principles, human rights, and to fight corruption. Spurring reforms before a dollar of U.S. taxpayer money is even spent is the MCC\u2019s model.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s an American model of development that has proven itself to work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States pursues, develops sustainable growth that bolsters institutions, strengthens rule of law, and builds the capacity of African countries to stand on their own two feet. We partner with African countries by incentivizing good governance to meet long term security and development goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis stands in stark contrast to China\u2019s approach, which encourages dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them their long-term, self-sustaining growth. Chinese investment does have the potential to address Africa\u2019s infrastructure gap, but its approach has led to mounting debt and few, if any, jobs in most countries. When coupled with the political and fiscal pressure, this endangers Africa\u2019s natural resources and its long-term economic political stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe welcome other countries\u2019 involvement in the development of Africa; in fact, it is needed. That\u2019s what the free market is all about, competition leading to more opportunities. But we want to see responsible development and transparent free market practices that foster greater political stability on the continent. We hope China will join us in this effort as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States sees a bright future in Africa. We have an opportunity to be part of Africa\u2019s journey to a stable, prosperous future for its people. Each of these priorities \u2013 trade and investment, good governments \u2013 governance, respect for human rights, combatting terrorism and instability \u2013 have the same guiding principle in mind: to help African countries build the capacity to take care of their own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are no quick fixes to these challenges, but the United States is committed to meeting them in partnership with nations of Africa so that the continent can increasingly become a place of prosperity and freedom in the 21st century. Thank you for your very kind attention. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I\u2019ve been collecting a few questions from the audience, some from the faculty, some from students, so I\u2019m going to maybe follow a little bit of a --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Go to the hard ones from the students.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: -- </strong>(inaudible). Since you insist, here\u2019s one. So the first one is maybe more of a personal nature, which is the reasons that led you to accept this position. As I mentioned earlier, you were leading one of the \u2013 really the largest companies that the world has ever seen, and not only that, you were CEO. You were your own boss. I mean, you had a board, but you were your own boss, and all of a sudden, why do this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I was within three months of mandatory retirement. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>That helps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>But I had \u2013 this was not in my retirement plans. I thought I was going to the ranch to spend more time with the life that I love and with my grandchildren. But the President-elect asked me to do this, and as I thought about it, this is \u2013 I\u2019ve told this story to a few other audiences, and it is how I got to the decision. When I was 18 years old, at that time we still had a mandatory military draft. It was the Vietnam War. And I registered for the draft, and they had a lottery system whereby people were selected. You got a number, and they pulled numbers until they met their draft quotas. And they got within three of my number my freshman year of college, and the year came and went, and my number was 89, they got to 86. And so I stayed in college, got a great education, got hired by a great company, had 41 and a half wonderful years, a dream career I never could have hoped for. My father is a veteran, World War II, fought in the war in the Pacific. My uncle is a retired major in the Army, did three tours of duty in Vietnam. And as I reflected on things at that point, I said I hadn\u2019t really done anything yet. It\u2019s my time to serve, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>Thank you for that. Now, you went to Texas at Austin, joined Exxon, and you may or may not have anticipated how incredibly global your own career would end up being. I\u2019m guessing if you had known what was going to \u2013 what your life was going to be like, you would have maybe prepped yourself a little better. Some of the folks in the audience still have the chance to make choices --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>(Laughter.) Right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>-- about what they do with their years in college, and this is a favor I\u2019m asking you, because I\u2019m pushing our students to go abroad, and some of them still don\u2019t believe why they should. So help me \u2013 what is the best plug that you can make for why should students go abroad? And then the follow up to that is: When they go abroad, they decide to go, for reasons still surprise me, to the UK, to Italy \u2013 well, Spain is not surprising, it\u2019s an awesome place to visit. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>So, why they should go to Africa, for example? So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think \u2013 in my first trip abroad I was a freshman in college, and I had an opportunity to travel to Peru. There had been a terrible earthquake, a big humanitarian disaster, two cities had been literally buried under thirty meters of a mountain that collapsed. And it led to a big flow of people out of the mountains into the edges of Lima and a terrible refugee camp was set up. So I went down to Peru on a five-day mission during the Christmas holiday to bring awareness to that situation, so that was my first opportunity. It had a tremendous impact on me because I hadn\u2019t \u2013 in fact, it was only the second time I had ever flown on an airplane. It was the first time I got a passport. And it was really the first time I had a connection to the world outside and realized how interconnected we are and how we\u2019re just all human beings trying to get through life, no matter where you are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think today the case for going abroad is even more compelling than at that time in my life, because all of you know the world has transformed so dramatically. The global \u2013 our economies have transformed so dramatically. Our own security has transformed so dramatically. And today, it is \u2013 it is all interconnected, and you simply cannot think about economic issues, you cannot think about security issues without thinking about them in a global context. And so, whether you\u2019re just continuing your journey and your education to expand your understanding of why you\u2019re spending the time hitting those books every night and writing those papers, it will completely change your perspective and understanding to go abroad and spend time in someone else\u2019s nation as the person that\u2019s not a citizen and see the life from their perspective, but also hear their perspective of how they look back at us. And it\u2019s \u2013 it will be probably the most valuable component of your education that you can put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then beyond that, this is going to continue, this interconnectedness of the world. The world is \u2013 really is \u2013 while physically it\u2019s the same size as it was the day God created it, for us, the people who occupy the planet, it is getting smaller and smaller and it is getting smaller at an exponential rate. And your generation is going to have to deal with that, and it brings with it an entire new dimension of challenges my generation is only seeing the front edge of. And it\u2019s important \u2013 the earlier you begin to understand that and how to interact with it, the better prepared you\u2019ll be for that in the future. And besides all of that, I promise you it\u2019ll be exciting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd go to the hard places. Don\u2019t go to the easy places. Like I said, I went to Lima, Peru. I went out into the mountains and the jungles. It was quite an experience to see how people exist around the world. Go to the hard places. It\u2019ll change you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> Thank you, by the way. Appreciate that. We\u2019ll take that and use it. (Laughter.) The \u2013 so now you\u2019re \u2013 in preparing for this trip to Africa, you\u2019ve picked five countries. How much of that is your own choice and based on your own experience in those countries? How much of that is sort of kind of technical decisions from your team? And at the end, why? Why those five countries out of all the many choices?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it\u2019s \u2013 obviously, I wished I had two or three weeks, because there are many African nations that are important to us that I think a visit would be beneficial to the relationship. But we picked these five. We\u2019re going to Ethiopia. Ethiopia is the home of the African Union; that\u2019s where it is located, their headquarters. Ethiopia also a very longstanding, important partner with the U.S. We have a relationship with Ethiopia that spans more than a century now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to stop in on Djibouti, the Horn of Africa. Djibouti is that country that sticks out right into the narrow straits between Yemen, leading into the Red Sea up to the Suez Canal, a very critical trading route for the world\u2019s economy and a critical partner in securing that trading route.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to Kenya, a large, thriving country. It\u2019s really where PEPFAR has seen its greatest success, and it\u2019s also been an incubator for how we expanded PEPFAR over the years. So we have a longstanding partnership with Kenya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to Chad \u2013 N\u2019Djamena, Chad \u2013 because Chad contributes the largest fighting force to the G5 Sahel and they have been crucial to our fight against terrorism in the Sahel and the success of what they\u2019re doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then finally to Nigeria, the most populous nation on the African continent. Tremendous natural resources and tremendous capabilities to succeed as a nation. They\u2019re still on their journey to succeed, and they are going to be critical to not just the relationship the U.S. has with Africa, but Nigeria is going to be critical to how Africa succeeds as a continent. And I spoke about the need to integrate African economies more, trade more with the neighbors. I think too often the U.S. in its approach \u2013 it\u2019s all been about trading across the transatlantic corridor. We really need to promote African intercontinental trade. That\u2019s actually going to open more opportunities for American investment and participation. So Nigeria, big country, very important country to the future of the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there \u2013 I\u2019d love \u2013 there are others I\u2019d love to go to. I\u2019ve traveled to North Africa, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be aware, but a lot of important countries in East Africa, South Africa, clearly, so obviously this won\u2019t be my last trip. I\u2019ll have to go back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> So you \u2013 as a CEO of ExxonMobil, of course you\u2019ve engaged, and I\u2019ve seen some of this. I\u2019ve been a partner in an earlier life in some of the work of how private companies can play significant role in development of the economies where you do business. Now, when I look at the proposed budget for \u201919, State Department is getting a pretty significant haircut, maybe a 25 percent cut, which I imagine is going to have to \u2013 it will force you to have to rely much more heavily on the private sector to achieve the diplomatic goals that you have. What are your thoughts about \u2013 are we going to see a bigger role in the private sector? And how do you bring them along?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Right. Well, first, on the budget itself \u2013 and that reduction\u2019s relative to 2017\u2019s budget because we\u2019re still waiting on an \u201918 final budget \u2013 but it also is a return to levels that are more historic for the State Department before the big run-up in the war against ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut yes, what we will be doing \u2013 and I mentioned that, touched on it in my remarks \u2013 is we want to facilitate more public-private partnerships. And we have mechanisms to do that and we have procedures and we\u2019re putting in place some new financing ideas where we can help countries have access to financing so they can participate themselves in private sector investments as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is \u2013 I mean, our role really, I think the U.S. Government\u2019s role, are the things that I stressed in there: one, to help with stability and security because if you don\u2019t have stability and security, it\u2019s tough to attract investment, it\u2019s tough to educate people, it\u2019s tough to feed people, to provide the bridging assistance in food security, on health areas, because again, as I touched on, the future is the young people. We got to have healthy young people, educated young people coming up. And then help with rules-based systems, so work with governments to put better laws in place, promote good courts and justice systems, and that\u2019s what will lead to the eradication of corruption which has drained the continent of so much capacity in the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\u2019s our role. The direct investments, we\u2019re there to facilitate and we\u2019re there to help companies understand what the opportunities are. If they need our help navigating through the local rules and whatnot, we\u2019re there to help guide them through that. But it\u2019s really to create the conditions in these countries where U.S. businesses and others \u2013 European businesses, Chinese, others to the extent they\u2019re ready to participate under a rules-based system, they\u2019re attracted because they see the conditions are there to be successful or at least have the opportunity to be successful. There\u2019s no guarantees in life, and I learned that in the private sector. All I ever wanted was to understand the rules, that the rules weren\u2019t going to change, and I had an opportunity to be successful. If we failed at it, we\u2019ll accept that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> One last question. I\u2019m reading some nonverbal messages \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 from your team. But the role of women in the future of Africa and my hope that you carry a very, very strong message \u2013 I know this is not new to you. I am aware of the investments that ExxonMobil made in women entrepreneurship. We know the impact that it has when women are kept in school instead of given into marriage. We know the impact that women have in improving health and the quality of life in communities. Let us \u2013 help us understand what our message is going to be in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it is something that I gained an appreciation for more than 20 years ago in the private sector, and largely because of investments and business activities that my previous life had in Africa, but also in emerging economies and emerging government systems, including Russia and \u2013 which I spent a lot of time in as well. And what I learned through studies, academic studies, but also my own experience is so much about creating these conditions that I\u2019ve talked about and so much about creating the conditions for people to thrive the way \u2013 and have a life like we enjoy is about breaking the cycle. And I was speaking earlier with the president of your student body about breaking the cycle and that we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re a generation away from breaking that cycle in Africa, but we have to stay at it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important element of that starts with women because it starts with mothers, and what we learned through our studies is that mothers \u2013 and probably this is true even here in this country, it was for me \u2013 mothers are the greatest influencers on how children are going to grow up \u2013 the values they hold, how they conduct themselves, and what they aspire to. And so first it\u2019s important that we support women\u2019s health first and their capacity to participate in the economic well-being of the country because too often we have women that are raising families without a lot of help from fathers. And so it starts with giving them capacity because they will raise better families.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut then secondly, putting women into not just the workforce, but the governance. They bring a very different perspective \u2013 and I see this in my private sector life, I saw it and I experienced it in the government sector as well \u2013 having a perspective brought that women bring, it\u2019s different from ours. I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that we\u2019re bad, but we have gaps and we have blind spots and women fill those in for us. But I think it\u2019s as much about anything \u2013 this is how we break the generational cycle is by really empowering women to fully participate in all aspects of our human life as mothers, as participants in the economy, as entrepreneurs, as participants in government. That is what will ultimately transform the next generation of leaders. Both men and women will be transformed by that and it\u2019s particularly important in Africa. And part of this is the history and culture of Africa. We know it works because we\u2019ve seen it work. We\u2019ve seen it work in very distinct areas. We just have to grow it out now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is crucial to, I think, the success of Africa creating a quality of life that we all want for people in the African continent. We want them to have the quality of life we have, and it\u2019s an important element of how we\u2019ll achieve that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> Mr. Secretary, we thank you again for coming to share that message with us, and most importantly for recognizing the huge importance that the African continent has for the rest of us, for carrying that message of economic development and opportunity, and for making Africa a priority. We wish you a productive and safe trip to Africa. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Thank you, and all the best to George Mason.

Today we will have senior State Department officials previewing the Secretary\u2019s upcoming travel to the continent of Africa. I want to remind you that today\u2019s call is on background, and I\u2019ll describe the attribution in just a few seconds.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Today\u2019s conference \u2013 our briefers today will be [Senior State Department Official One]; from here forward he will be referred to as Senior State Department Official One. We are also joined by [Senior State Department Official Two]. He will be referred to as Senior State Department Official Two. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019ll open up with brief remarks from Senior State Department Official One, and then we\u2019ll turn it over for your questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Okay. Thank you very much, and thank you on this very window day here in Washington, D.C. for joining all of us. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The trip by Secretary Tillerson really is an outgrowth of the ministerial meeting for 37 ministers from Africa back in November of 2017, and this will be a kind of follow-up with the Secretary traveling to Africa. So his trip is going to begin on Tuesday, March 6th, and it will take him to \u2013 first to Ethiopia and then down to Djibouti and then Kenya, and then all the way up to Chad, and then down over to Nigeria. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So this trip is really \u2013 and we apologize for kind of the last-minute \u2013 because we\u2019ve been just back and forth on how the trip would be arranged and the schedules and the trips going in and out and which countries to select. And so \u2013 and also given the Secretary\u2019s tight schedule, this is what we came up with, and we announced it yesterday.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the whole purpose of the trip is really to follow up on the ministerial meeting, and that is if Africa in the year 2100 is going to form 40 percent of the world\u2019s population, over 30 percent of the work force, yet also have the potential of having 50 percent unemployment rate, which is very high, that is a security issue, a economic issue problem, but more important, it\u2019s also an opportunity. And so the United States says, \u201cHow do we position ourselves to play a significant role in supporting Africa and also as a \u2013 to highlight this important relationship?\u201d And we said it\u2019s going to be based on \u2013 not only on economic and commercial development, but in the context of building strong institutions, governance, and security, as well as human rights.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issue, too, that we\u2019re looking at is how to really keep African resources and also development beneficial for the people of Africa. Right now we\u2019re looking at the growing indebtedness in Africa. That\u2019s not a good thing. We\u2019re looking at other countries, not helpful countries, other countries too, expropriating a lot of resources. And as you know, high rates of rare earth minerals and metal are from Africa. I mean, just one example is if your cell phone is 10 percent of that material comes from resources in Africa, in the next decade it\u2019s going to be 25 percent. Then that\u2019s an issue of: How do we do rational allocation of resources? How do we benefit the people of Africa? How do we create jobs? How do we really develop Africa, and not just become a repository for the development of other regions of the world?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are some of the issues and challenges that we\u2019re facing, and we can \u2013 through the Q&amp;As, we can go into what we seek to achieve in each country. But the bottom line is really economic development, how to build strong institutions, and also to move forward in the future for Africa. And just for your information, three of the four \u2013 three of the embassies being visited or countries visited has the largest American embassies in Africa. And just for your information, we have 44 American embassies and six consulates and offices in Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So we\u2019re set. We can turn it up to Q&amp;As.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone phone. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating you\u2019ve been placed into the queue.

Once again, if you do have a question, you may press * then 1 at this time. One moment, please, for our first question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And our first question from the line of Felicia Schwartz with <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Your line is open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the counterterror objectives of the trip. It seems like Djibouti, Chad, some of these stops are very counterterror focused, so if you could talk about some deliverables you expect or what you\u2019re hoping to achieve.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> So the issue comes in as there\u2019s really no deliverables, and the reason why is because for the Secretary of State and for our trip now it\u2019s really to underscore the commitment of the United States to Africa but also to explore with the leadership in each of the countries about what we want to achieve at the \u2013 together as partners but also in our overall program. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So going into Djibouti \u2013 so Djibouti is, as you know, mainly French relationships, but we also have \u2013 it\u2019s also the base for the only U.S. military base in the entire region. But it\u2019s more than just the U.S. military. I was there when Camp Lemonnier first started back in 2001. We\u2019re really talking to President Guelleh and his government because, as you know, Djibouti after the <i>USS Cole </i>bombing in Yemen \u2013 Djibouti now becomes really the main refueling spot for all U.S. Naval ships and also support for the U.S. as well as French military bases, the Japanese, our two task forces. We have 150 and 151 which does counterterrorism and counterpiracy.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But the focus is also how do we really continue to have a strong relationship with Djibouti. As you know, Djibouti is part \u2013 has troops in Somalia as part of AMISOM, which is to stabilize Somalia and to move it forward. And Djibouti has become a important country in peacekeeping operations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And let me just kind of give you one factoid. So if 53 percent of all UN operations are in Africa, 87 percent of the world\u2019s UN troops are in Africa, and almost 70 percent \u2013 actually over 50 percent \u2013 of all the troops are African, then that becomes very important. So for us, what we\u2019re looking at is how do we deal with Djibouti as a partner in that realm as far as peacekeeping operations. And the second area is to continue having good U.S. military relationships, because that is our base there. And it\u2019s not just a base for counterterrorism but also to support the security of all the other countries in the region. So I hope that kind of helps. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Chad, let me just give \u2013 on Chad is we\u2019re working with President Deby because, as you know, they were given on the visa sanctions list. That\u2019s not a good thing. They have been trying to get off those lists. They\u2019ve made tremendous motivations and movement toward getting off that list, so we\u2019re trying to support them as best we can and also to improve their own personal security.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We also want to give Chad importance because they\u2019re part of the G5 countries and their troops have made a tremendous amount of sacrifices in providing troops in supporting Mauritania and Niger and other countries in the G5 area. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So that\u2019s what we would \u2013 that\u2019s part of it. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Hi. And I just want to remind everyone to please make sure that your phone is on mute if you\u2019re not speaking. Thanks very much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have a question from Abigail Williams with NBC News. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi there. Thanks for doing the call. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> At the \u2013 towards the top in your opening you talked about the importance of focusing on development in these countries and job opportunities.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> What is it that the Secretary will be doing on this trip to try to help with that in the various countries he\u2019ll be visiting?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> I think we need to look at how to build \u2013 and so for instance, the countries that we\u2019re going to, so Kenya is our largest embassy in all of Africa. And then of course followed by South Africa, which we\u2019ll probably go later, and then of course Nigeria and then Ethiopia. And so \u2013 and Ethiopia, as you know, you\u2019re looking at transition from a prime minister to another prime minister, and so there we want to make sure that we\u2019re working with the Ethiopian partners on institution building, human rights, engagement, community leadership, et cetera, which will make them a much stronger partner. And also because of its 8 percent economic growth rate, it really is \u2013 becomes an engine for economic growth for the entire region. So that\u2019s \u2013 so we\u2019re trying to look at how we can work with that country.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And I\u2019ll give you one \u2013 sorry, I\u2019ll kind of go off tangent here. Ethiopia, had purchased something like $2 billion worth of Boeing 787s transport airplanes and also 777s. And so the prime minister, the late Prime Minister Meles, said, \u201cYou know, we just saved 35,000 American jobs. What are you doing to help Ethiopia?\u201d And that was a very valid, fair question. And so what we\u2019ve been doing is trying to look at the various sectors where they have economic advantages and opportunities, and that\u2019s in the ag sector. So in other words, their coffee, their flour, they even do Fruit of the Loom and Starbucks apron productions. But we\u2019re looking at much more. So in other words, in our discussions with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs and others, we\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat is it that we need to do to help these countries develop from agriculture to industrialization and then to consumer-based industrialized growth?\u201d And Ethiopia, I think, is on that track, but what are the mechanisms? What is it that we need to help them with as far as savings rate, education, and industrialization, and access to resources? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so as you know, the United States, we don\u2019t build things, but we teach things. And so our biggest thing is education, girls\u2019 education, women entrepreneurs, helping with expanding electrification. And certainly on a continent where most people do not have access to electricity and electricity is really critical for industrialization, that\u2019s important. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So going back to girls\u2019 education, in all our areas of development is \u2013 girls\u2019 education is very inexpensive, but it really brings out a lot of high-volume growth. Anywhere we have high girls\u2019 education, we also have high rates of growth. And when I was in Afghanistan, we were in the northern part. We had 40 percent girls\u2019 education there and economic development was great, but in the southern area it was less than 20 percent, economic growth was very bad. And we see the same results all over, from Ethiopia to Nigeria to the Congo. Areas we have 40 percent or higher rates of girls\u2019 education, we have tremendous amount of development, and it\u2019s sustainable development, and it goes to other areas. So that\u2019s some of the things that we\u2019re looking at in these areas. And the same thing with Kenya and Nigeria as well. I hope that helps somewhat.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Our next question from Laura Koran with CNN. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you so much for doing the call. I\u2019m wondering what message we can expect to hear from the Secretary in terms of how he views the role that China plays on the continent, and particularly, what the U.S. is willing to offer to some of these countries to counter that growing influence in the coming years.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </b> Yeah. Okay. So here\u2019s an interesting point is that we, the United States, especially part in \u2013 by region. So in the Africa region, we are going to have a heart-to-heart discussion with the Chinese. We\u2019ve invited the Chinese to come to Washington to talk about their programs in Africa. And so on the one hand, the unhelpful role is the providing low-interest but really concessionary loans which really indebts the country. So for all of us who worked on HIPC \u2013 in other words, getting African countries post-colonial period off of debt \u2013 to see these countries re-indebted again is not only outrageous and terrible, but for us it\u2019s really just \u2013 I mean, we spent so much time getting them off of debt, and to see them to go back on debt is just terrible. And it goes back to not only corruption in some of these states, but also the ease in which not only China \u2013 and you\u2019re talking Russia, Iran, and other countries providing low-interest loans. And this is really kind of another forum of impoverishment and poverty, because it\u2019s \u2013 unlike HIPC, we can\u2019t really kind of repay loans back to banks, and so this is going to be a very tough issue to address.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issues aside too, though, is China builds things. We don\u2019t construct. And so in that regard China can play a helpful role. The other issue, too, is that China has some really good ideas on development in developing areas, such as how to do better healthcare, how to do water production. So those are things that are good. Also China did a good favor for us in Sudan, providing an engineer battalion to provide assistance to the UN operations there. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So when you look at China, it\u2019s a very complex relationship. We have a lot of areas and issues that we\u2019re in conflict, but the issue comes in is that we\u2019re trying to find the areas where we can build some type of support and cooperation that will be to the betterment of Africa. But one area that\u2019s not to the betterment is these loan rates, which is terrible. So we\u2019ve looked at countries, and we\u2019re doing data dumping. Some \u2013 a lot of countries in Southern Africa and parts of the east and west are having anywhere from 50 percent to in one case 200 percent of GDP debt. And 80 percent and 50 percent are probably Chinese loans, and that\u2019s really not acceptable, and that\u2019s an area that we really need to address and focus on.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So when you said \u201ccountering China,\u201d I think the better word is probably how are we going to resolve tensions, problems. How can we make China much more supportive of the overall development of Africa. Because what we don\u2019t want to see is \u2013 let\u2019s say, for instance, Congo, which is very rich in resources \u2013 where you see Russia, China, North Korea, Iran taking out resources, yet the Congolese don\u2019t receive very much in benefits. How do you resolve that? How do you develop, how do you get these countries to really benefit from the resources that they have, yet at the same time these countries such as China, Russia, Iran is also developing but also they give back a lot to the Africans? And that\u2019s an issue and a question we need to pursue during this trip over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have a question from Nike Ching with Voice of America. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much for doing this phone call. It\u2019s really appreciated. My question is regarding the political development in Africa. Twenty countries in Africa are holding national elections in 2018, which include Chad and Djibouti\u2019s national assembly elections. And separately, we saw the state of emergency in Ethiopia, and in Kenya a demand for greater diversity in the presidential cabinet. Now, my question for you is given the history of unrest in Ethiopia and other place, in the U.S. vision, what is a genuine inclusive political process look like in those countries? And in your assessment, what should those governments do to improve press freedom and human rights? Thank you very much.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> And thank you, Nike, and then I look forward \u2013 we look forward to seeing you next week as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the issue right now is \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely correct. Over two decades ago, we were looking at the number of really democratically elected countries, and it was really very few. It\u2019s only three or four or so. But now we have over two dozen, which means those are two dozen countries which are not going to have transitions in government through coup d\u2019etats and illegal methods, et cetera, we hope. Now, obviously, a lot of those countries are fragile democracies and we\u2019re trying to strengthen them, but look at the most recent elections in Liberia \u2013 so the first really free, open, fair, and peaceful transition of governments in over 75 years, and that\u2019s a good thing. And really, after the horrendous rule of Charles Taylor and the degradation of the institutions there, but now we\u2019ll going back and they\u2019re building, and I think with the election of George Weah that\u2019s going to be a positive thing.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And you see the same thing in \u2013 with Akufo-Addo in Ghana and Ouattara in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Macky Sall in Senegal. So you see a lot of developments. And as we look at the 20 elections, obviously Nigeria, though it\u2019s not this year \u2013 it\u2019s going to be next year \u2013 that really is a major priority focus, because that\u2019s going to be the third most populous country in the world by 2050. And it has really very complex political issues and ethnic and tribal issues and security issues, and that\u2019s an area that we really are focusing on how to do a peaceful transition, a democratic transition, but more important is how to hold governments accountable to the people.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Now, you raised Ethiopia, and that is \u2013 remains a challenge for us and a focus for us as well and an opportunity, because we\u2019re looking at trying to build institutions, really strengthen institutions, and also have peaceful transitions and hold governments accountable to the people. We\u2019re looking at how we can have reconciliation and dialogues between all of the different groups \u2013 the Oromos, the Amharas, the Tigrays, and also in Kenya with the opposition and with the ruling government. And so those are some of the things that certainly during this trip are going to be the subjects of discussion, is how do we do these \u2013 building strong institutions, holding governments accountable? How do we advance political and economic reform that will help in the transition process? Those are issues too that we\u2019re working in Zimbabwe with the transition between Mugabe and Mnangagwa, and also we\u2019re looking hopefully at South Africa with the election of Ramaphosa from Zuma and seeing how that\u2019s going to transition. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And \u2013 so we\u2019re very hopeful. We\u2019re very high on Africa, and let me just give you one factoid that\u2019s very interesting: So we were doing some data crunching, and in the early days \u2013 in the \u201980s and \u201990s \u2013 we were looking at 19 evacuations of some country around the world. And evacuations are full evacuations or partial, and Africa had its fair \u2013 fair number. But if you look at the last couple years, actually, the number of evacuations or countries in crisis really are not in Africa. We had, like, four in the last year and a half. We\u2019ve had, I think, it\u2019s like eight or so in the last couple years, three years. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those numbers in Africa look really good. I mean, you still have the problems of DRC and Sudan, which really grab the press; but overall, across the continent, it\u2019s pretty good, it looks really good. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do is: How do we build on it? How do we boost stability? How do we do security? How do we build institutions? And so those are the things that this trip is going to try to highlight, and it\u2019s going to be really a start, a dialogue, that we can really work with our African partners to achieve. Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR: </b>We have a question from Simon Ateba with Today News Africa. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Yes, thank you. The president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, says there cannot be business without peace. And as you know, yesterday Boko Haram killed several UN humanitarian workers and also kidnapped hundreds of student last week. Will Secretary Tillerson, will he propose any new cooperation with Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon in the fight against Boko Haram, or will this be only about business? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And finally, why didn\u2019t the Secretary go to Cameroon since the U.S. has hundreds of troops in Cameroon fighting Boko Haram? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </b>Yeah, those are very \u2013 they were very good questions, and thank you. And just kind of starting out last, the Secretary\u2019s trip, this is his initial trip to Africa. He\u2019s going to come back again, and we are going to look at Cameroon, we\u2019re going to look at South Africa, we\u2019re going to look at other countries. Of course, with South Africa, with the transition to Ramaphosa, we were kind of saying, well, probably this is a very critical country for the U.S., but I think it\u2019s once the government is established and set, I think then we\u2019ll probably go there.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But Cameroon, yes. Cameroon raises an issue, but so does Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali. And so there\u2019s a lot of countries, and which countries do we head to? So on Nigeria, this is really a really important issue, and I know that in the last administrations, even the last three, we have always said going to Nigeria is critical to stability and the future for the U.S. relationship in West Africa. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So on Nigeria, you really raised really good points, is that \u2013 so we are following the recent kidnappings of 110 school girls, which really kind of follows up on several years ago of the Chibok girls. And those are horrendous, they\u2019re unacceptable, terrible, and how do you do security? But the issue that comes in, it\u2019s not only a security issue \u2013 and it is a terrible security challenge \u2013 but it\u2019s also political issues and really building those institutions and political dialogue between north and south, and also with the region. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those are some of the things that we need to look at. It\u2019s a comprehensive approach. The other issue, too, is on economic development and education. So looking at the UN, we have fresh UN reports about some of the extremist operations in the G5 countries, the Trans-Sahel, is for some of these groups it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s about getting jobs, it\u2019s about looking at getting an income for families. And if terrorism or trafficking of persons, if that\u2019s going to get them the jobs, then that\u2019s unacceptable and we really need to find alternative ways to help the economic development in these regions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those are some of the issues and challenges that we\u2019ll be working on is political institutions, political dialogue, reconciliation, supporting community-based development, helping growth, education. And then on the other hand, as you said, is the security, particularly in the north, and how do you enhance security. And it just can\u2019t be constantly a kinetic strike operation or bring in U.S. military. That\u2019s not the answer. The answer has to be developing institutions and also providing good police training, military training, and having governments accountable to the people and having people really have faith in their institutions, and also having opportunities for job creation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And what happens in Nigeria is going to affect the Lake Chad region, and that includes Cameroon as well as the G5 countries. So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at, much more broad-based, comprehensive, and really interrelated with security. Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR: </b>And we have a question from Michele Kelemen with NPR. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thanks. I wondered \u2013 just following up on Nike\u2019s question \u2013 how the Secretary plans to navigate the political turmoil in Ethiopia. Is he going to have any meetings with opposition figures or former political prisoners, and what messages he has to the government there? And then while we have you, you have any reaction to what happened in Burkina today?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah. So those are very good points, and in Ethiopia, again, it\u2019s \u2013 is to reaffirm that we\u2019re committed to the continued institutional development, and that we are looking \u2013 everyone\u2019s looking at how they conduct this transition from Haile Mariam, who belongs to really a minority group in southern Ethiopia. And there\u2019s a lot of rumors on who might be \u2013 it could be an Oromo or it could be another group. But whatever it is, is that the process really is going to bring all these various ethnic groups and regional groups and other political parties into the room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Again, the Secretary\u2019s trip is very short, and so that means there\u2019s going to be a follow-up. So obviously, after the Secretary\u2019s ministerial last year, we all went on \u2013 all over Africa to kind of follow up. I went on a 15-day, 10-country trip. I\u2019ll be going out after the Secretary\u2019s trip again to this region. And it\u2019s not just \u2013 Michele, not only just the interrelating with the Oromo and the Amhara groups, but again, community leaders, women-based groups, opposition. Yes, the people in prison, that remains a concern. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re addressing. But also regional issues \u2013 relationships with Eritrea, looking and supporting the Ethiopian negotiations with \u2013 in South Sudan, and also their troops in Somalia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So it\u2019s going to be an initial discussion. There\u2019s going to be follow-up and a lot of discussions. And even now, before the Secretary\u2019s gone out there, I\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve all spoken to the leadership. Our ambassador, Michael Raynor, and his team are doing a fabulous job really reaching out and just setting up the base for a discussion. And we\u2019re going to follow up, and this is going to be a long-term process. And it\u2019s not just Ethiopia. It\u2019s Kenya, it\u2019s South Africa, it\u2019s Zimbabwe, and it\u2019s Nigeria.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Going to your second question, is on Burkina Faso. We\u2019re still getting a lot of information that is \u2013 that\u2019s troubling. Burkina Faso is a focal country for our G5 operations. The $60 million that was committed by Secretary Tillerson, about 30 million is going to go to Burkina Faso for military training and security training, but also we\u2019re looking at all different communities. Burkina Faso is a very diverse community. It has a large Christian community \u2013 it actually has Catholics, has a number of Catholic bishops. It has a Muslim population. And it\u2019s looked on as being much more relatively calmer than the other states. But I think this attack on the French military, the local military bases, that raises concerns. We\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019re still getting assessments as this comes in, and it\u2019s still a very fluid situation. But it does raise concerns.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Any follow-up? Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. It\u2019ll be just a moment for our next question. One moment, please. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah. Oh, hello. Any more questions?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> I think there are a few. I think we have time for maybe one more.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Rosiland Jordan with Al Jazeera English. Your line is open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing the call. Three quick questions. One: Will there be any discussions with any of the governments about refugee outflows, particularly to EU countries and possibly on to the United States? Any possible ideas to try to deal with that problem? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Number two: Is there any reason, or was it ever considered, that the Secretary might try to visit Somalia in order to show visceral support for President Farmajo? There\u2019s a lot of talk about supporting the Somali security forces, but what about supporting the actual government in Mogadishu?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then finally, regarding Nigeria and Chad and the G5 Sahel situation, what specific conversations will there be about trying to deal with radical Islamic groups that have pledged their fealty to ISIL and who are wreaking political havoc, particularly in West Africa? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Okay, very good \u2013 great point. So going back to the refugee flows \u2013 and that is \u2013 that remains foremost in a lot of \u2013 in our minds, et cetera. As you know, the whole refugee flows \u2013 we\u2019re looking at approaching 10 million refugees in all of Africa. But I think we also should not forget the number of internally displaced, which is probably approaching around 12 million. And the two countries that are of highest concerns is South Sudan and the DRC, and those are two countries that will be under discussion, as the Secretary visits the African Union. And also with Ethiopia, which is leading the high-level discussions in \u2013 with South Sudan and Salva Kiir. So that does remain, but also the internally displaced.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issue too is, as you said, on Somalia. Somalia remains a very critical issue, but where the Secretary goes, I think what he announced obviously open to \u2013 subject to change, but right now, what he announced yesterday, those are the countries he\u2019s visiting for now. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But what you raise on Somalia is a point. So I\u2019ve worked in Somalia quite a number of times since the last \u2013 since Black Hawk Down. I was just there recently. We are looking and working very closely with the TCCs of the AMISOM troops and also the countries that are \u2013 the African troops and the African Union, also the UN envoys working on Somalia. But again, it\u2019s more than just security. It is a security issue, but it\u2019s also a political will issue about, as we have said to President Farmajo, is working with the six other regional leaders and also working on institution building and also working eventually to a one-person, one-vote, which we hope will be by 2024 or 2028. So that will be \u2013 continue to be a high point of interest for not only the Secretary, but for the U.S. Government.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then going back to Nigeria, so again, that is a challenge \u2013 the ISIS-West Africa, Boko Haram, and also the \u2013 where these groups are emanating from Nigeria to Lake Chad area and to the G5 countries. But the question comes in is \u2013 we continue to assess the changing and the evolving relationship. We look at the recent UNDP report which said that 71 percent of people who are radicalized in Africa were radicalized because of the abuse by the security sector in their own country. So that means that we need to do a lot more on security reform, training, institution building, democratic values, accountability to eliminate those \u2013 and the other area too is on job creation and economic, so building economic issues.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so when you say a lot of groups are claiming allegiance to al-Qaida or ISIS or whatever, we\u2019re seeing in some instances where these are aspirational, other areas of opportunities, but the other issue too is that it\u2019s economic in nature as well. So it\u2019s very complex as things that we\u2019re still looking at very carefully, and really how to address it. And those are issues that \u2013 it\u2019s not just Nigeria. It goes across the Trans-Sahel and it goes all the way down to Somalia. And then we look at how is it that \u2013 what do we need to do as the United States in our partnership with Africa and the African Union to really build stability so that they don\u2019t have these organizations and groups. And one of the things that we point to is the DRC in Eastern Congo, where you have a proliferation of these groups which have become extraordinarily violent, and a lot of it is due to the political instability, insecurity, and not knowing about the next electoral process in the DRC, which we\u2019re trying to push towards December of this year.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at, but again, it\u2019s complex, no easy answers, and I think we probably need to have a much more in-depth discussion. Over. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

We\u2019re very glad to host him here. We pay great attention to this visit because we\u2019re passing through a very critical timing in our bilateral relations, and therefore we do believe that this visit is of utmost importance.\n\n\n<p>\n\tTurkey and the United States of America have been continuing their strategic partnership over the course of the history, increasing its depth every day, and with the steps that have been taken on both sides, this strategic partnership has been extended into various spheres. And it does not just include the two countries, but in our region and beyond, it includes many countries as well as many states and many nations who are benefiting from this strategic partnership. The basis of this strategic partnership is actually the fight that we gave together in Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our past, we had some ups and downs in our relations. We even had times of crisis, but always and always, the strategic partnership vision was at the forefront in terms of its mid-term and long-term goals. When we started dialogue in a frank and sincere environment, we were able to overcome all these critical phases together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, like I have said, we are passing through such a critical stage in our relations. Yesterday, we were received by the president of the republic, and we had a trilateral meeting, and we had the same sincere and frank atmosphere where both sides expected \u2013 expressed their thoughts, their expectations, and even their worries in a most sincere and frank manner. And the meeting, which took about three hours, was not just a meeting that we discussed our bilateral relations, but also our cooperation in regional issues as well as our mutual perspectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I said before, our relations are at a critical turning point. We were either going to correct this and continue our relations or we were going to go into a much more worse position. But with the will that we put forward as of yesterday, we have taken an important turn in terms of normalizing our relations. We reached an agreement and an understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, there are certain steps that are needed to be taken to achieve this. There are expectations on both sides. We have certain worries about the Fethullahist terrorist organization and our fight against this FETO terrorist organization, and the support that is provided by the United States on YPG and similar organizations, and our expectations pertaining to PKK. Of course, these are very important security worries that are closely related to our existence, and we do want to believe that these are taken into consideration seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut up to this point, there were certain promises that were made, there were certain topics that we discussed, there were certain promises that were not kept, and there were certain issues that we could not resolve. So from this point on, we wanted to focus as to how we can take solution-oriented steps so that the issues are not just on paper, and we wanted to talk about how we can implement this, how we can make sure that they are implemented. So we were able to talk about all of these, and we decided to create a mechanism or even mechanisms to be able to discuss these and resolve them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne such mechanism, as you will see in the press declaration, is about the general issues: the consular issues, the issue regarding FETO, the Fethullahist terrorist organization, and some issues that the United States attaches importance to. Actually, we had a working group that we established after the visa crisis, but now we are going to extend the content of all of these and we will be talking about all of these together. For instance, on the FETO issue, do we have evidence or not? Do we need any additional evidence? Is the evidence that we have sent sufficient? Instead of discussing this in length before the public, we want to discuss this in the working \u2013 (break in audio) \u2013 because in order to reach any conclusion, any result, we need to work together and act together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Break in audio.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Syria issue, we also talked about how we are going to overcome our worries regarding the Syrian issue: which steps are we going to take, how are we going to fight against terrorist organizations, how are we going to establish stability in those cities that have been cleared of terrorist attacks, how \u2013 who is going to do this, how are we going to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq, and most importantly, how are we going to work together to achieve a political resolution with the Geneva process. So we were able to talk about how we will take concrete steps with our experts so we\u2019re not talking about promises or commitments any longer. We want to overcome all of these by working together, and I am sure that all of these will bring important results for us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll these mechanisms are not kicking the ball off to the corner. They are not delaying the process. To the contrary, these are important aspects to get results and mechanisms that will achieve results that will meet the expectations of both sides. So we are not trying to gain time, and hopefully, the next meeting is going to take place before the middle of March. We have agreed on this aspect as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the end, distinguished members of the press, the meetings that we had yesterday and today have been important in terms of the future of our bilateral relations, in terms of overcoming our mutual worries, and both on Syria, Iraq, and especially on the issue of the fight against terrorism. The cooperation with respect to regional issues were important, and this was a critical visit and a critical series of meetings. I do believe that once the relations are set into track again, what is important is as a result of all these visits and meetings to be able to take step towards the future jointly, commonly, in partnership, and get results. So we will work like two allies, establishing trust once again, and we will base our relations on this basis that have been strengthened by our partnership and alliance thoughts. With these opinions and thoughts, once again I would like to say welcome to our guest, Mr. Tillerson, and leave the floor to him, and then we will be answering questions from your side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, I want to thank Foreign Minister Cavusoglu for his hospitality during this visit, and I also want to express my appreciation to President Erdogan for the extensive amount of time he provided to me yesterday evening so we could have a very full discussion of both sides\u2019 concerns but also a lot of discussion about the future and how we go forward from where we are today. I want to reaffirm the deep and important relationship between the United States and Turkey. Ours is not an alliance of convenience or of temporary interest. It is a time-tested alliance built on common interest and mutual respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTurkey was one of the first countries to join NATO. Turkish troops served alongside Americans in Korea, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo. We have made many shared sacrifices together. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Turkey against terrorist threats. Turkey is a critical partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Daesh. We\u2019re grateful that Turkey has allowed the United States and other NATO countries to base forces in Incirlik, and Turkey is the linchpin of strategic stability at the crossroads of the three continents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur two countries share the same objectives in Syria: the defeat of ISIS, Daesh; secure and stable zones; an independent and unified Syria; and help chart a new democratic future for Syria under the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 process. We are hopeful that the Geneva process will produce a new constitution for the Syrian people and elections to be held under UN auspices. A democratic future for Syria is essential for preventing ISIS from re-emerging and from stopping the suffering that the Assad regime has inflicted on the Syrian people. The Turkish Government and people deserve the gratitude and recognition for the unprecedented hospitality they have displayed in hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize the legitimate right of Turkey to secure its borders. We take it seriously when our NATO ally Turkey says it has security concerns. As to Afrin, we call upon Turkey to show restraint in its operation to minimize the casualties to civilians and avoid actions that would escalate tensions in that area.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve been transparent with Turkey regarding our objectives in Syria. Our relationship with our NATO ally Turkey is enduring and strategic. I again conveyed this message to President Erdogan and to the foreign minister today, as have many other U.S. officials. We have always been clear with Turkey that the weapons provided to the Syrian Democratic Forces would be limited, mission-specific, and provided on an incremental basis to achieve military objectives only.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have long supported and will continue to support Turkish democracy. Respect for the rule of law, judicial independence, and an open press are a source of strength and stability. When Turkey maintains its commitment to these principles, it expands our potential partnership. We support the Government of Turkey\u2019s right to bring the perpetrators of the 2016 coup to justice. It is important to handle these cases in a transparent and fair manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. We continue to have serious concerns about the detention of local employees of our mission in Turkey and about cases against U.S. citizens who have been arrested under the state of emergency. We will continue to engage with our Turkish counterparts to seek a satisfactory resolution to these cases, and we call upon Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson and other U.S. citizens whom we believe are being unjustly detained. With regard to Serkan Golge, we believe his release through the appeals process would be both just and appropriate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want to thank again President Erdogan and Foreign Minister Cavusoglu for the opportunity to discuss these and many other very, very important issues, and for the cooperation we both have been able to show one another and respect in charting a way forward in this relationship. The United States truly appreciates our long friendship with Turkey. We value it, and we look forward to strengthening it as we move forward. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> (In Turkish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Sevil Erkus from <i>Hurriyet Daily</i>. My first question will be to our guest, Secretary of State. Mr. Tillerson, we are actually passing one of the most critical stages of the Turkish-United States relations. In order to overcome these problematic aspects \u2013 the aspect pertaining to the assistance of military equipment to YPG and PYD \u2013 Ankara worries. In order to overcome all these worries, and also, in the context of Syria, to establish cooperation between Turkey and United States, do you have any proposals for solutions? Could you share these with you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, if the Afrin operation is extended to Manbij, the fact that there are American soldiers there \u2013 do you have any plans to withdraw forces from that region, or the fact that they\u2019re at harm?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy question to you, Mr. Foreign Minister --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) So we said actually two questions each, but you have asked more than 10 now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) My question to you: Before you said either these relations are going to go worse or going to be improved. You said today that you had taken a decision to normalize relations. Did you get the relevant warranties or safeguards from the United States that you were expecting from your side?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother aspect: With respect to a news item that was reflected on the media, it was indicated that the troops on Manbij would be withdrawn to the eastern part of Euphrates and that this was a proposal that you brought. Did you make such a proposal indeed so that the American troops were withdrawn from that area, and how does American side resolve?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) So this is actually a question for two hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>In our discussions last night with President Erdogan, we brought forward proposals on how we can address all of the critical issues that are standing between this relationship today. And those will be addressed \u2013 some will be addressed in the joint statement that we will be releasing following this press avail. But the foreign minister did touch on a few of those, and we want to work specifically on the issues that are standing between us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat we have agreed is our objectives for Syria are precisely the same. There are \u2013 there\u2019s no daylight between Turkey and the U.S. objectives: defeat ISIS, stabilize the country, create stabilization areas so eventually refugees and internally displaced persons can begin to return home, and support the political solution for Syria that will result in a whole, independent, democratic Syria with no special demarcations dividing Syria and with the Syrian people selecting their leadership through free and fair elections. And we all share that same objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd now, going from this point forward, we are going to closely coordinate our efforts against the final defeat of Daesh. We do not have them fully defeated today, but we\u2019re going to coordinate our efforts against the final defeat of Daesh as well as other terrorist groups that are located inside of Syria. We want to coordinate how to stabilize areas together and who will occupy those areas. And the objective and intent is to return these villages, these cities back to the composition of people who were there before they were overrun by Daesh. So we\u2019re going to address Manbij first. It\u2019s one of the first areas we\u2019re going to work on. The United States made commitments to Turkey previously. We\u2019ve not completed fulfilling those commitments. Through the working group we\u2019re going to address that, and Manbij is going to receive priority.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut it\u2019s not just Manbij. We have to think about all of northern Syria, and we\u2019ve agreed on certain areas we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work together, and then we\u2019re going to coordinate very closely on supporting the Geneva process, because ultimately, that is the pathway to a peaceful, stable Syria. That improves Turkey\u2019s security as well on its border when we can achieve that final peace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. At the beginning of my remarks, I said that this was a very critical visit for the future of our relations. It was a critical timing. Therefore, in the meetings that we held since yesterday evening, we talked about how our expectations were to be met, and there were other concerns of the United States on their citizens, about the local employees of the consulate. There were, of course, expectations on their side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re already working on these consular issues, but our worries were in direct relation to the direct threats that we were receiving about the YPG attacking our citizens, because our people are dying. Up to this point, we had about 100 citizens, Turkish citizens, or Syrian-origin people coming from Afrin. They were killed by missiles or by arms that were coming from Afrin. They lost their lives because of this. So of course, undoubtfully, this working group which is going to meet our expectations and the concrete steps that we will take is crucial. This is important on YPG, on ISIS/ISIL, on FETO. These are important with relation to all of these aspects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, on Manbij, of course, Rex Tillerson gave the answer to your question. And in 2016, there were commitments of the United States to Turkey at every level, including President Obama, John Kerry, and Mr. (inaudible), who is still at his position, and by other people in high-level positions, but these promises were not kept. And even at one point, we were to send a delegation to tell that YPG was actually going to move to the eastern part of Euphrates, but from that visit we were not convinced and we learned later on that they had not moved. So in this process, we are going to start from Manbij, and we will be sure of the steps that we have taken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also need to ensure that YPG is going to move to the eastern part of the Euphrates. We need to see the implementation together, and Rex stated very clearly: For stability in these regions, we will talk about as to who is going to manage these cities and who is going to provide the security. If Manbij is 95 percent Arab town, it actually does not make any sense that YPG is going to provide security there, because that will mean that there will not be any stability there. So we will be talking with this understanding so that stability is attained and we will be rest assured of the security. It\u2019s not just for Manbij, but we will start from there. And once YPG leaves that and after we have the trust established, we will be able to take steps together with the United States of America, but now YPG needs to leave that zone, and this is a commitment that the United States of America has made to us, and we will be talking about the implementation of how this promise will be kept. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> (In Turkish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Mr. Secretary, there seems to be a little short on specifics here. Do you agree that you are talking about what you\u2019re going to do in the future and you have not agreed on specific steps that will begin starting today? And can you explain why it has taken so long for two allies to come together with an agreement on what seems to be a very basic principle, that two allies will not shoot at each other in Syria and one will not give the other an \u201cOttoman slap\u201d? Are you confident that in the future some of the rhetoric will be turned down, and what has been the hang-up?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, I wanted to ask you if you agree that some of the rhetoric in recent weeks from yourself and your president has been overheated and unhelpful. And also, what will it take for your government to finally be confident enough to lift the state of emergency and release thousands of your own citizens, plus the American citizens and embassy employees who have been imprisoned on what much of the world considers to be very flimsy evidence? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, with respect to how we\u2019re going forward \u2013 and that\u2019s what all of the discussion here was about, recognizing where we find ourselves. And I think as the foreign minister indicated, we find ourselves at a bit of a crisis point in the relationship. And we could go back and revisit how we got here, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s useful. We\u2019ve decided and President Erdogan decided last night we needed to talk about how do we go forward. The relationship is too important, it\u2019s too valuable to NATO and our NATO allies, it\u2019s too valuable to the American people, it\u2019s too valuable to the Turkish people for us to not do anything other than concentrate on how are we going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd out of the meetings last night \u2013 and much of our staff was up through the night to memorialize how we\u2019re going to go about this, and we\u2019ll share a little bit of that in the joint statement. We\u2019re going to reserve a lot of the details because there\u2019s a lot of work yet to be done, and we \u2013 and our working teams need to be allowed to do that work in a very open, frank, honest way with one another so that we can chart the way forward together. And I think that\u2019s the important point I want you to take away here, is we\u2019re not going to act alone any longer. We\u2019re not going to be U.S. doing one thing and Turkey doing another. We are going to act together from this point forward. We\u2019re going to lock arms, we\u2019re going to work through the issues that are causing difficulties for us, and we\u2019re going to resolve them and we\u2019re going to move forward with the future defeat of ISIS in terms of coordinating our efforts to complete this battle, which is not yet complete; to addressing other terrorist presence inside of Syria; to stabilizing areas and ensuring that the stability architecture, both security forces and governing councils, are representative of the conditions that existed in those cities before they were overrun by ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we have good mechanisms on how we can achieve that, but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. People are going to have to roll their sleeves up. We\u2019re going to get started very quickly. As the foreign minister said, we\u2019re going to have the first round of these engagements before the middle of March. We know we need to move with some sense of urgency and promptness to address this, because we have a serious situation still inside of Syria, and we need to address that jointly together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I would say the specifics will emerge out of the work as we allow these groups to come together, but I think the objective, we\u2019ve made clear as to what our objective is. So now we\u2019re going to have a team of people working towards putting that in place and implementing it, and we\u2019ve given you a little bit \u2013 just a little bit of a peek of some of the early priorities we\u2019re going to place for these groups to work on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much for your question. Since last night, we have been talking about how we can overcome these problems, and these are not just explanations and announcements coming from our side. That will not be a realistic approach. Our declarations was not declarations of enmity. And of course, we were taking into consideration our worries and the realities that we show \u2013 show from our side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLikewise, as politicians, sometimes we take certain steps, and by the steps that we take and by the commitments that we have paid, we might be guiding this popular sentiment with the positive inputs. But when it comes to a point \u2013 this is true for all political sphere, but in Turkey, the president of the republic and we as politicians, including me, we should be voicing the opinion of the Turkish public, because we are representing them. And the declarations that we made were just ramifications of the popular thought in Turkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the detention or the prosecution that is taking place \u2013 this does not have anything to do with the state of emergency in Turkey, and this state of emergency is nothing to restrict the fundamental rights and freedoms of Turkish citizens or anybody living in Turkey. In 2003, one of the first steps that we took when we came to government was actually to remove the state of emergency in southeast part of Turkey. In some European countries, after one terrorist attack there is a state of emergency declared. But we, on the other hand, were \u2013 the leader of a terrorist organization who is residing in Pennsylvania attempted a coup in our country. So with the state of emergency, we needed to take rapid steps against this terrorist organization. This was the expectation of our people. So the prosecution that is continuing in Turkey has been in line with the EU, with the Council of Europe criteria, and in line with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the legislation which has been democratically enacted in Turkey in parallel with those standards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this prosecution within the state of emergency has nothing to do with any judicial proceeding that goes on in this period. Therefore, independent courts that have been established and that have been reformed with the legislation in parallel to the standards of the EU and the Council of Europe are conducted. It does not have any \u2013 does not receive any direction from any other third country or a political intervention from within. And the state of emergency does not have any connection to this. We do hope that within this whole process we would always have the following: that in terms of accelerating in the prosecution we might have certain recommendations, but in the end, the independent judiciary passes judgment. The appeal process is open. You can go all the way up to the constitutional court. We do have an individual application system to the constitutional court and even the European Court of Human Rights. So the remedies in terms of the legal sphere go all the way up to Strasbourg within that understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Gonca Senay from TRT World. I have questions to both ministers. In terms of earning in the trust of the Turkish public, I think we listed the expectations on the Turkish side, but I do want to ask a question to Mr. Tillerson, especially reminding him of the budget drop that was proposed by Pentagon. Will the arms assistance provided to YPG by the United States of America \u2013 is it going to cease? And this morning, there was certain news that the Turkish soldiers would be acting together with the American soldiers in Manbij. Thirdly, will you take a step on the FETO issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMr. Cavusoglu, my question to you is that you talked about certain mechanisms involving FETO, and you said that you were talking about the mid-March. Is there any timetable, or is this an agreement that both sides have reached? And what is going to be the level of this working group? What level in the administration? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>With respect to DOD\u2019s budget for the coming year, only sufficient funds have been included in their budget to continue the defeat of ISIS campaign, and this is to continue to supply the SDF forces primarily with ammunition, because this fight goes on. There\u2019s no more being provided than we believe is necessary to complete the battle to defeat Daesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe question of Manbij is one that, as I said, is going to be given priority in our joint working group effort, and this is one of \u2013 as the foreign minister indicated, one of the issues for us to work together on is what kind of security should be provided. Manbij is strategically a very important city from the standpoint of our defeat of Daesh but also our containment and ensuring that they do not re-emerge. It\u2019s geographically important. That\u2019s why the U.S. has left a troop presence in Manbij to ensure that that city remains under control of our allied forces and does not fall into the hands of others. So that will be a topic for discussion in terms of how we go forward to ensure Manbij remains within our control because of its strategic importance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we did agree \u2013 we had a lot of conversation last night with President Erdogan regarding the concerns over Fethullah Gulen back in the United States as well as his organization, and we\u2019ve agreed that we will continue to examine all the evidence that can be provided to us. We will continue our own efforts at our own independent investigations to ensure that we know when illegal activities are being carried out in the United States, and we remain open and anxious to receive any new information and evidence that the Turkish Government can provide us as well. So it remains an open investigation with the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. As I have just mentioned and I \u2013 as I repeatedly say, the purpose of these mechanisms and working groups is to keep the promises that were not kept so far, and in order to take tangible and concrete steps. This is true for YPG; this is true for FETO as well. And in Syria, not only ISIS/ISIL, because we have achieved important results regarding ISIS/ISIL, and the Republic of Turkey has fighted more than everyone in this fight, and it just killed more than 3,000 Turks in just Syria. And as \u2013 in \u2013 with regards to foreign fighters, their extradition and their prevention in terms of entering in the country, we have taken important steps and we have also served as a co-chair as well in the council. But we need to fight against all types of terrorist organizations in order to achieve the political framework that we have just described with new constitution, with new laws. We want to take the country to an election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, these working groups will have different boards, and for example, in the first one, the ministry of foreign affairs will be the coordinator. However, there will be officers from the intelligence unit from the ministry of justice as well. And especially regarding financial crimes and regarding topics about the corruptions of FETO terrorist organizations, we will have representatives from the department of financial crimes. And as it was mentioned by Rex and by relevant authorities, recently there are investigations carried out regarding FETO schools in this United States, and it will bear us the results about the corruption taking place in the U.S. and how they achieve, how they earn these money for election. And with just simple investigations, we \u2013 they will see these results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd again, regarding Syria, we will have our soldiers \u2013 I mean the ministry of defense \u2013 we will have intelligence units and other relevant authorities in these groups and in these wars. So we have identified the participants and we have agreed on the parties as well, and from now on we will try to come together and achieve results altogether.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Did you warn Turkey that they could be subject to sanctions under CAATSA legislation if they go ahead with the purchase of the S-400 system?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd for you, Mr. Foreign Minister, would the threat of U.S. sanctions stop you from going ahead with the purchase of the S-400 system? And if you do buy the system, do you still want to remain in NATO if you\u2019re obtaining the weapons from Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>We did discuss the impact of the CAATSA law that was passed by the Congress last summer that deals with purchases of Russian military equipment. I discussed it last night with President Erdogan; we had further discussions this morning about it. And indeed, it\u2019s in the first group of issues that the foreign minister is referring to. We need to put a group of experts together, and we\u2019ll look at the circumstances around that, as we\u2019ve done with governments all over the world, not just Turkey, because the intent of that legislation was not to harm our friends and allies. But it is directed at Russia for its interference in our elections. So we\u2019ve been advising countries around the world as to what the impact on their relationship and purchases that they might be considering with Russia, and many have reconsidered those and have decided to not proceed with those discussions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEvery case is individual on its own. We want to consult with Turkey and at least ensure they understand what might be at risk in this particular transaction. We don\u2019t have all the details yet, so I can\u2019t give you any kind of a conclusion, but it\u2019ll be given very careful scrutiny, obviously, and we\u2019ll fully comply with the law. And we are \u2013 we are now implementing CAATSA and fully applying it around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> Thank you very much. First and foremost, I need to underline that I am against the terminology that you use. You used the threat terminology. That is not a correct terminology to be used because it is true for all countries and states. We never use the language of threat and we deny if it is used against us, because this is not correct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut as Rex has also indicated, this was not something that we talked just yesterday and today. When we met in Vancouver, we talked about this, and from time to time when we have phone conversations, we talk about such issues. This was again brought to the agenda in one of those talks. Of course, there is a law that was enacted by the United States Congress, and they explained this legislation to us. But on the other hand, this is our national security, and it\u2019s important for our national security. I have emergency need of an air defense system. We want to purchase this from our allies, but this does not exist. So even when we are purchasing small-scale arms, the Congress or some other European parliaments, we have \u2013 we have and we had difficulty in purchasing these because of these excuses, and I have an emergency need. And the Russian Federation came up with attractive proposals for us. We also talked to other countries, not just with Russia, but we talked about this issue of emergency need with many countries and we had bilateral talks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in the mid-term, we talked about joint production and technology transfer. We focused on this because this is important for Turkey. And lastly, during the Paris visit of our president \u2013 with Eurosam \u2013 this is a French-Italian partnership \u2013 there was a pre-agreement signed, a memorandum of understanding signed with these groups. So we do not have any problems with our allies. Why should we not meet this requirement with NATO? But, of course, when it is not met within this platform, we need to look for alternative resources. Otherwise, some batteries \u2013 some Patriot were withdrawn from our frontier. Some European allies withdrew them. We have (inaudible) of the Italians and Patriots of Spain, and we do not have any other air defense. And we need to meet this requirement as soon as possible. And when we talked to Russia, this was actually an agreement that we reached before the legislation in Congress was enacted. And the remaining part was about the details of loans, et cetera.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, we talked about all of these, and we will take into consideration this \u2013 within this working group the commission, but all of us need to understand each other and respect each other. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "date": "February 13, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<span><span>We, the Foreign Ministers and principals of the Global Coalition, have come together in Kuwait City united in our determination to defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh through a focused, sustained, multifaceted effort. We know our enemy: ISIS/Da\u2019esh is intrinsically malevolent, celebrates cruelty, systematically violates international law and regularly commits gross abuses of human rights. Yet three and a half years into this effort, ISIS/Da\u2019esh stands undeniably degraded \u2013 it has lost its territorial hold in Iraq and only a few pockets of land remain under its control in Syria. Its leadership, on-line presence and global networks are under pressure. But our work is not done. ISIS/Da\u2019esh remains a serious threat to the stability of the region and to our common security. Enduring defeat will come when ISIS/Da\u2019esh no longer has safe havens from which to operate; when it no longer poses a threat to our homelands; and when it can no longer convey its ideology of hate globally. Recognizing that we are at an inflection point, where we must sustain attention to Iraq and Syria to secure our significant gains, while simultaneously adapting our footing to curb ISIS/Daesh\u2019s global ambitions, we offer these Guiding Principles as our vision for the future of this Coalition.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ultimately to achieve a full and enduring defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh, the Coalition will fully eliminate ISIS/Da\u2019esh as a territorial threat in Iraq and Syria and stabilize liberated communities in an inclusive manner. We will mobilize Coalition members and external partners, using a whole-of-government approach, to disrupt ISIS/Da\u2019esh networks and its branches and affiliates, including possible new manifestations and variants, and deny its freedom of movement, safe havens, and access to resources in accordance with and in support of UNSCR 2396. We will combat ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s ideology to prevent its reemergence, recruitment, and expansion. We will support local voices that offer an alternative vision to ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s propaganda, and we will redouble our efforts to deny ISIS/Da\u2019esh space to exploit social media and the Internet. We will work to consolidate our gains to date and prevent a re-emergence of ISIS/Da\u2019esh by supporting Iraqi-led political and security sector reforms, and, through UNSCR 2254, committing to reach a political solution in Syria, thus helping to address root causes for the appearance of ISIS/Da\u2019esh.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Our approach rests on a number of key pillars. First, we see this Coalition as a mobilizing and coordinating mechanism nested in a much larger diplomatic, military and counterterrorism ecosystem, in accordance with the principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and relevant Security Council Resolutions. Second, we recognize nations bear primary responsibility for defending their homelands against ISIS/Da\u2019esh; our Coalition must work by, with, and through our partners. Third, membership in this Coalition is voluntary, as are the contributions each of us makes to this effort. Fourth and finally, we agree there is no single approach to the defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2013 each one is tailored to address the unique nature of the threat in a given country or region \u2013 importantly, most approaches to ISIS/Da\u2019esh globally will not mirror our efforts in Iraq and Syria, where Coalition-led military action has been central. That said, we agree there is great utility in sustaining collaboration and unity of purpose across the Coalition against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and ISIS-related threats on a global scale.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At the heart of our collaboration are the Coalition\u2019s Working Groups, and each one has a unique path forward. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Counter-Finance Working Group (CIFG) focuses on identifying and disrupting ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s ability to generate revenue and access the regional and international financial systems. As ISIS/Da\u2019esh adapts in response to its territorial losses in Iraq and Syria, the CIFG will adapt with it, leveraging its collaboration with like-minded multilateral organizations and encouraging members to take more concrete actions against ISIS/Da\u2019esh financing.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Foreign Terrorist Fighter Working Group (FTF WG) focuses on supporting and encouraging preventive, counter-terrorism-related information sharing through appropriate bilateral and collective law enforcement channels (such as Interpol), rehabilitation/reintegration, law enforcement and legal/criminal justice actions to mitigate the FTF threat (including FTF and their families returning, relocating and resurfacing). The FTF WG will continue to serve as a platform for an international whole-of-government approach, enhancing collaboration and capacity building within and across disciplines and seeking close connections and where possible integration with relevant international CT structures such as the Global Counterterrorism Forum.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Communications Working Group seeks to contest the information space in which ISIS/Da\u2019esh operates and to ensure that the contraction of the group\u2019s territory is followed by its ideological defeat. It co-ordinates and coalesces the strategic communications approaches of Coalition members; fosters external partnerships to amplify the reach and impact of the international community\u2019s efforts to degrade ISIS/Da\u2019esh propaganda; and it builds resilience in vulnerable audiences \u2013 all aimed at reducing ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s capability to use propaganda to recruit, and to incite and inspire violence. We will share expertise and best practice to tackle future propaganda threats from other violent extremist organizations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Working Group on Stabilization plays a central role coordinating and promoting international stabilization efforts in Iraq and, where possible, in Syria. Successful IDP return is essential to consolidate the military defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh. In the course of 2018, as stabilization work in Iraq begins to conclude, the group will also assist the Iraqi Government's efforts to secure the significant military gains against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and prevent new violence in liberated areas by supporting the transition from stabilization to sustainable reconstruction. At the same time, the Police Training Sub Group will strengthen its focus on \u201cblue training\u201d and support the Iraqi government\u2019s efforts to restructure the Federal police and create a civilian police force that represents and is trusted by all citizens in Iraq. In Syria, the Working Group on Stabilization will coordinate and promote stabilization efforts with the aim of strengthening credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, in accordance with and in support of UNSCR 2254.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The defense aspects of the Coalition also will continue to evolve as the nature of the threat changes and the Coalition increasingly focuses on ISIS/Da\u2019esh networks and branches. As with the Coalition's Foreign Ministers, Defense Ministries also will continue to coordinate regularly on how best to address the threat. The Coalition will pursue its military commitment in Iraq and Syria, and the existing Coalition Force Command in Tampa will continue to support the efforts in the region, in order to secure and stabilize the liberated areas to help retain our significant successes against ISIS/Da\u2019esh to date.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Across lines of effort, we will work to ensure women and women\u2019s organizations are fully and actively engaged and included in peacebuilding and stabilization efforts, in accordance with UNSCR 2242, and will seek to ensure our policies and practices are gender-informed and guided by international legal frameworks.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh was founded in September 2014 based on the worldwide concern over ISIS/Da\u2019esh and the threat it poses to international peace and security. The Coalition has made enormous progress since then, but our work is not done. Looking ahead, we recognize the need to remain alert to the inevitable evolution of the ISIS/Da\u2019esh threat, and to flexibly adapt our response, including through existing multilateral and regional counterterrorism and CVE institutions. We will revisit these Guiding Principles as appropriate. We recognize that the Coalition and its Working Groups serve to focus the international community\u2019s attention on countering the global/transnational threat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh. With that in mind, the Coalition should look to share its expertise into international counterterrorism efforts wherever possible, with an eye to a time in the future when the international community is confident it has the tools to address and neutralize ISIS/Da\u2019esh and ISIS-related threats.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And this is obvious through the ongoing collaboration and cooperation between the members of the coalition to defeat any kind of terrorism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn this occasion, I would like to reiterate my heartfelt congratulations to the Iraqi people on their victory, the historic victory and the liberation of their country from ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the amount of effort exerted by Iraq and the rest of the member countries in the global coalition in their war against so-called ISIS, and these efforts actually culminated in liberating Iraq from ISIS. Today, we are required to continue exerting efforts in times of peace just like we did in times of war.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStemming from this fact, the state of Kuwait has announced, upon the initiative of His Highness Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the emir of the state of Kuwait, may God protect him, it has announced the holding of the Kuwait International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq, which will be taking place alongside this current meeting in an effort to preserve the stability, security, and unity, as well as territorial integrity, of Iraq. This is an effort to pave the way and to find the favorable conditions to start the reconstruction of that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, despite the very positive developments and outcomes that we have achieved on the ground, the international community continues to face a direct threat by armed terrorist groups. And this is why it is a fair amount important for our coalition to continue exerting international efforts and to continue coordinating jointly to fight terrorism and to further develop the strategy set forth by the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this framework, we are full of hope that the efforts of the Government of Iraq will succeed and will be fruitful in holding the perpetrators of terrorist acts accountable, to avoid any impunity. And this should happen according to the UN mechanisms as reflected in the resolution, in the Security Council Resolution 237 of the year 2017. And also we need to exert or to step up the experience of Iraq in terms of judicial capabilities to \u2013 in this regard, and we need to continue working to stem the flow of terrorist \u2013 foreign terrorist fighters, in accordance to international resolutions 2396, 2253, 2199, 2178, and 2170.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, as part of its responsibilities in the Global Coalition Against ISIS, the state of Kuwait has hosted five international conferences to fight terrorism, and these include the Stabilization Working Group meeting, the meeting of the Small Group of the Global Coalition, the special meeting of the Counter-Messaging Working Group, the meeting of the Preventing Terrorism Financing Working Group, in addition to the meeting on preventing the flow of terrorists and foreign fighters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the end, I wish to welcome you once again in the state of Kuwait, and I hope that this meeting will be a successful one and will be a continuation of the many successes achieved by the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. And we hope that we will come up with recommendations and strategies that we can implement on the ground in an effort to protect the international community from extremism and terrorism. Thank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI now have the honor of giving the floor to my friend and colleague, the U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Rex Tillerson. The floor is yours, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Good morning, and thank you, Excellencies, Minister al-Sabah, for the \u2013 for welcoming me today, and I want to also greet excellencies, colleagues, and friends of the coalition. I appreciate the opportunity to address you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt has been approximately three and a half years since the global coalition began its effort to defeat ISIS. At the time we started our efforts, ISIS/Daesh was thriving. Today, ISIS/Daesh is failed. Approximately 98 percent of the territory once held by ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been liberated. Approximately 3.2 million Syrians and 4.5 million Iraqis have been freed from the tyranny of ISIS. Over 3.2 million internally displaced Iraqis are now back home. ISIS\u2019s leadership, online presence, and global network are under more pressure than ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the end of major combat operations does not mean that we have achieved the enduring defeat of ISIS. ISIS remains a serious threat to the stability of the region, our homelands, and other parts of the globe. Without continued attention on the part of coalition members, we risk the return of extremist groups like ISIS in liberated areas in Iraq and Syria and their spread to new locations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEach of us must continue our commitment to the complete defeat of ISIS. Maintaining stabilization initiatives is essential in this regard. If communities in Iraq and Syria cannot return to normal life, we risk the return of conditions that allowed ISIS to take and control vast territory. We must continue to clear unexploded remnants of war left behind by ISIS, enable hospitals to reopen, restore water and electricity services, and get boys and girls back in school.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, it is critical that the funding facility for stabilization be fully funded in this, its final year, in order to ensure the stabilization initiatives led by the Government of Iraq can be well-positioned to prevent a resurgence of ISIS. The United States appreciates the generous contributions of coalition members over the past year, but we all must do our part to ensure that (inaudible) stabilization (inaudible) in Mosul City, western Anbar, western Nineveh, and (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, the United States continues to be the world\u2019s largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian crisis. At the end of January we provided more than $216 million in new funding, bringing our total humanitarian assistance to nearly $7.7 billion since the start of the crisis. Today, I am announcing that we are providing an additional $200 million to further support critical stabilization and early recovery initiatives in liberated areas of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo ensure an enduring defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, we are working with the global coalition and local partners to consolidate military gains. Home forces are essential to securing liberated areas and setting the conditions for safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States will maintain a conditions-based and ISIS-focused military presence in Syria. As part of that presence, we will continue to train local security forces in Syria. We are also working to ensure the local forces we train are effective, professional, accountable, and respectful of human rights. It is essential that these forces be representative of their local communities and do not pose a threat to neighboring communities or neighboring countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, we remain concerned over recent events in northwest Syria and call on all parties to remain focused on defeating ISIS, de-escalating and resolving the Syrian conflict, and protecting innocent civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe are keenly aware of the legitimate security concerns of Turkey, our coalition partner and NATO ally. We will continue to be completely transparent with Turkey about our efforts in Syria to defeat ISIS, and we stand by our NATO ally in its counterterrorism efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs ISIS continues to evolve, so must the coalition. (Inaudible) ISIS is attempting to morph into an insurgency in places like Afghanistan, the Philippines, Libya, West Africa, and others, and is trying to carve our and secure safe havens. We have seen in Iraq and Syria the consequences of an ISIS territorial threat. History must not be allowed to repeat itself elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs ISIS fighters (inaudible) Security Council Resolution 2396 is a new and effective tool for countering threats posed by foreign terrorist fighters. The United States calls for quick implementation and full enforcement of the resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLastly, we must keep up the pace of combatting ISIS as it continually seeks to radicalize, recruit, and direct operations online. We must be aggressive in online spaces (inaudible) such as the instant messaging service (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe fight against ISIS will remain difficult. Coalition partners must call on all international powers to eradicate this threat. Every one of us must continue to adapt and strengthen our coalition through counter-ISIS\u2019s own network of foreign fighters, financing, and propaganda. And we must continue to deepen our partnerships in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States supports the revised guiding principles being presented today. They reaffirm our common determination to continue our efforts until we have achieved the full and enduring defeat of ISIS. And they (inaudible) our vision (inaudible) the coalition and our ongoing cooperative efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the opening line of the guiding principle says, \u201cWe are,\u201d and I quote, \u201cunited in our determination to defeat ISIS/Daesh through a focused, sustained, and multifaceted effort.\u201d It is now our duty to keep taking action that reflects that determination. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m also very pleased to be with Foreign Minister Shoukry, who has become a friend as we have engaged on a number of challenges in the region and to address those jointly and with a great deal of agreement between us as to how those issues need to be addressed. I look forward to my meeting with President al-Sisi and appreciate his receiving me as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a very productive discussion on our shared regional and security concerns. We spoke about opportunities as to how to strengthen our ties and, as the foreign minister indicated, mechanisms by which we can deepen those ties and further explore areas for mutual cooperation, first through the strategic dialogue which we\u2019ve agreed we will have later this year, and then we\u2019re going to explore also the possibility of a 2+2 dialogue to even allow us to further enhance these conversations both on a full range of issues of not just security concerns, but political and economic opportunities as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI did express to the foreign minister our condolences to the people of Egypt for the violence that they have been suffering from the terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Egypt\u2019s been battling this level of extremism for many years, and we continue to be steadfast partners in their response to these attacks throughout this time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe agreed that we would continue our close cooperation on counterterrorism measures, including our joint commitment to the defeat of ISIS, and Egypt has been a very important member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition from the beginning. They \u2013 Egypt deals with the threats of ISIS themselves and are dealing with it certainly currently in the Sinai.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also discussed the importance of the protection and promotion of human rights and the vital role of civil society in Egypt. With the presidential elections planned for the end of March, the United States, as it does in all countries, supports a transparent and credible electoral process, and all citizens being given the right and the opportunity to participate freely and fairly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn Libya, the United States and Egypt support the UN\u2019s Action Plan for Libya for credible and peaceful elections in their country. This will promote stability \u2013 much-needed stability for Libya and their economy to prosper. As the Security Council affirmed on December the 14th, the Libyan Political Agreement in our view must remain the framework for a political solution throughout Libya\u2019s transitional period.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tForeign Minister Shoukry and I also discussed Syria and how we can work together to reinforce the UN-led Geneva political process, which is the only political framework through which this conflict can be resolved. And Egypt has played a very important role in supporting dialogue between opposition representatives and the central government in Damascus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Middle East peace, I reiterated that the Trump administration remains committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, the foreign minister and I also discussed how we can intensify our countries\u2019 economic engagement and support our private sectors to generate jobs and prosperity for both of our people, and I acknowledged and welcomed the very important \u2013 although we know difficult \u2013 steps towards reform that President Sisi has undertaken in order to create a very strong foundation for future prosperity and economic performance in Egypt, and those have been necessary, although difficult, to be fully \u2013 receive the full support of the IMF, and Egypt has met all of those requirements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll do what we can to continue to encourage the economic recovery and we hope that American companies are able to increase their investments in Egypt that will create jobs and opportunities here as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, again, commits itself to standing with Egypt, standing shoulder to shoulder in these \u2013 in the fight against terrorism, but also standing together to create a more stable region for everyone as well, and I thank the foreign minister for our opportunity to meet and exchange on so many important issues. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think the commitment the U.S. has to Egypt\u2019s security in the fight against terrorism should be evident, and both with the release of about a billion dollars of foreign military financing assistance to Egypt to continue to strengthen its capabilities, and also sharing of other approaches to countering terrorism, some of which we can talk about, some of which we can\u2019t so easily talk about. But our joint commitment to defeat ISIS is steadfast and there has been no gap between Egypt and the United States in our joint efforts to confront terrorists and extremist \u2013 extremism in the region, but most specifically here in Egypt as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think the Egyptian people should be confident that the U.S. commitment to continuing to support Egypt in this fight against terrorism, in bringing security for the Egyptian people is steadfast, and that will continue, and we had a great deal of exchange today about how we can advance that. And we just mentioned the intent to have a strategic dialogue later this year. All of these are opportunities for us to identify other ways that we can strengthen and support Egypt\u2019s fight against terrorism, but also, ultimately, to strengthen the economic development of Egypt as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.) Carol, <i>Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Mr. Secretary, given the concerns (inaudible) to run against the president (inaudible) election and who were arrested and disqualified, how (inaudible) do you believe those elections will be? And will the United States consider withholding more military aid from Egypt (inaudible)?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, sir, human rights groups have called this the most repressive era in modern Egyptian history. What did Secretary Tillerson tell you about democracy and civil liberty here in Egypt? And will anything change here in Egypt after your meeting today? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think as I indicated in my prepared remarks, and I would answer the same: We have always advocated for free and fair elections, transparent elections, not just for Egypt but in any country. And so the U.S. is always going to advocate for an electoral process that respects the rights of its citizens to make the choices the citizens want to make and the full participation of citizens in those elections. And nothing has changed about our advocacy for those types of elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY: </strong>As relates to some of the comments that have been made by certain members of the human rights community and other activists, I would only recommend that you ascertain for yourself the nature and the current situation in Egypt as relates to human rights, and how the Egyptian people view this administration and its efforts to strengthen and protect human rights, and whether there is that sense of restriction that you alluded to. I think it is \u2013 it isn\u2019t helpful that a certain group projects from a perspective of lack of information, lack of direct association to a society, but it is much, much more important the general conditions, the freedom of press that is available, the variety of television shows, the dialogue and the exchange. Development in the social and political field is an evolutionary process. I think over the last 11 years, the Egyptian people have shown their commitment and their determination and their ability to change their course and to indicate their dissatisfaction. If they deemed that they were dissatisfied, they have been able to change two governments in the last seven years, and they have undertaken legislative elections and know how to protect their rights and to advocate for those rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s important that I think we recognize that it is the Egyptian people who should determine how they are applying their freedoms and their political activism, and I hope that you will have the opportunity while you\u2019re here in Egypt to discuss this with the Egyptians on the street and ascertain from them directly whether they are satisfied with current conditions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a discussion with the Secretary related to Egypt\u2019s efforts to develop both politically, economically, and socially, and that we continue to do so out of our desire to see Egypt evolve into a place of \u2013 that can fulfill the aspirations of its people, and we will continue to rely on the support that we can depend on from the United States in this regard. These are commitments that this administration is confident it will fulfill, and it is responsible to the Egyptian people to continue to fulfill those commitments, as has been stipulated in our constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think it\u2019s important to note that in the announcement President Trump made regarding Jerusalem he also made two very important points as well, one of which was he was not advocating for any change to the status quo as to oversight of the holy sites, recognizing the proper role of existing authorities; and the second is that the final boundaries of Jerusalem are yet to be determined, and that those will be decided among the parties. And those \u2013 I think it\u2019s oftentimes those two important points seem to have been overlooked in his announcement. And yes, the U.S. is still committed to the peace process and still believes we have an important role to play in bringing the parties together and seeing a resolution to this. And President Trump is committed to that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.) <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, Felicia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Secretary Tillerson, Vice President Pence, in an interview with <i>The Washington Post</i>, endorsed what you\u2019ve described publicly as talks about talks with the North Koreans, and president \u2013 South Korea\u2019s President Moon said he would go to Pyongyang. Is this the start of a diplomatic process in North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then for Foreign Minister Shoukry, the U.S. has in the past raised concerns about Egypt\u2019s ties with North Korea. What is Egypt doing to cut those ties?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> I\u2019m not sure I could hear the last part of your question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was just asking if this \u2013 is this the start of a diplomatic process with North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as to \u2013 as to the Vice President\u2019s comments about potentially having talks and whether it\u2019s the start of a diplomatic process, I think it\u2019s too early to judge. As we\u2019ve said for some time, it\u2019s really up to the North Koreans to decide when they\u2019re ready to engage with us in a sincere way, a meaningful way. They know what has to be on the table for conversations. We\u2019ve said for some time that I think it\u2019s important that we have \u2013 we\u2019re going to need to have some discussions that precede any form of negotiation to determine whether the parties are, in fact, ready to engage in something this meaningful, in order for us to then put together the construct of a negotiation. So we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> We did discuss with Secretary Tillerson the issues related to North Korea, the Korean Peninsula, and the security of that region. Egypt has had normal diplomatic ties with North Korea, as does many Western and NATO members, and those ties are, in terms of the relationship, limited to representation, and there is almost no existing economic or other areas of cooperation. But we are concerned with the current status with the threats emanating from the proliferation of nuclear weapons, a situation which we deem as threatening to the global nonproliferation regime, one that has to be dealt within our maintaining global security, also the threats of ballistic missile systems to South Korea and to Japan, and we believe that all of these issues must be resolved for the security of the region and the Korean Peninsula. And we will continue to discuss these issues and to take the appropriate measures to deal with these challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for a background call to preview Secretary Tillerson\u2019s upcoming to travel to Amman, Ankara, Beirut, Cairo, and Kuwait City. We are joined today by [Senior State Department Official One], [Senior State Department Official Two], [Senior State Department Official Three], [Senior State Department Official Four], and [Senior State Department Official Five]. These officials will be known now as Senior Department Officials One, Two, Three, Four, and Five respectively. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is on background and will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. With that, I\u2019m happy to now turn it over to our first speaker who will begin \u2013 who will brief us on the Secretary\u2019s travel to Amman. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Hi, folks. Senior Department Official One here with you. So as you know, part of the visit to \u2013 on this trip is going to involve a trip to Amman, Jordan. It\u2019s something that Secretary Tillerson had been planning on doing for quite a long time. When he\u2019s there he\u2019ll meet, obviously, with King Abdullah and with Foreign Minister Safadi. He\u2019ll pay a visit to the U.S. embassy, including a new annex that will be reopened there \u2013 that will be opened there soon. And he\u2019ll do a visit with the U.S. embassy staff, one of our largest teams in the Middle East. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the purpose of the visit, and recall that this visit comes on the heels of a very successful visit by Vice President Pence only a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s really a marker of the longstanding and enduring strength of our U.S.-Jordan partnership. At the center of the visit is going to be conclusion \u2013 Secretary Tillerson and his counterpart Foreign Minister Safadi \u2013 conclusion of a bilateral MOU that enshrines our commitment to cooperate on a whole range of bilateral assistance priorities \u2013 economic, defense, security \u2013 over the coming years. The details of that MOU we will leave for the actual signing when the team is in Jordan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the visit of the Secretary to Jordan will highlight our cooperation with the Jordanians on a whole range of issues \u2013 their work with us resolving the conflict in Syria, the defeat of ISIS and other terrorist groups, and our work \u2013 continuing work to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, including Israeli-Palestinian peace. Obviously, the Secretary will convey our assistance and understanding and support for Jordan as they host upwards of 650,000 refugees, and our commitment to supporting Jordan\u2019s efforts to manage the refugee influx while implementing reforms designed to stimulate Jordan\u2019s economy, promote private sector-led growth, and renewable energy in Jordan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Now we\u2019ll take a preview of the trip to Ankara.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> So Secretary Tillerson\u2019s visit to Ankara is the next step in a series of high-level telephone and in-person engagements we\u2019ve had with senior Turkish leadership, the purpose of which is really to reaffirm the value of our alliance with Turkey and the shared interests that we face as we try and work through a range of these challenges together. The Secretary obviously plans to raise some of the more difficult issues in the bilateral relationship as well as some of the things that are going better. And then he\u2019ll also, of course, discuss the full range of regional and security issues, from the defeat ISIS campaign to counter PKK and so forth. We don\u2019t have a full, final schedule yet in terms of who the Secretary will meet exactly when, but he will be meeting with senior level Turkish officials and have some internal meetings at the embassy as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right, thank you very much. And now we\u2019ll go back to Senior Department Official Number One to preview Beirut.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> So again, as part of the visit, the Secretary\u2019s going to visit Beirut. This is the first time a Secretary of State has been to Beirut in four years. And obviously, the center of that visit, he\u2019ll meet with President Aoun, with Prime Minister Saad Hariri, and with the speaker of the parliament, Nabih Berri. It\u2019s really an opportunity to affirm our support for Lebanon as it confronts a whole range of challenges \u2013 defending its borders from terrorists, coping with extraordinary influx of refugees, upwards of a million refugees since the start of the Syrian war. And the visit will also underscore our commitment to Lebanese national institutions, principally the Lebanese Armed Forces and internal security forces in Lebanon, as those forces fight ISIS, al-Qaida, and maintain Lebanon\u2019s stability.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>He\u2019ll obviously also raise the question \u2013 the issue of Hizballah, the destructive role that Hizballah plays in Lebanon and across the region. It\u2019s obviously unacceptable that a militia like Hizballah continues to operate outside the authority of the Lebanese state, and that will be a major topic of discussion between him and Lebanon\u2019s leaders. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And now we\u2019ll take a preview of Cairo.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> So Egypt\u2019s a key strategic partner for us in the region, and the Secretary\u2019s visit to Cairo is an opportunity for him to further build upon the strengthening of the relationship that has occurred over the past year in the array of senior level engagement that there has been \u2013 most recently the Vice President\u2019s visit just a few weeks ago.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary will meet with Egyptian President al-Sisi, his counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, and he\u2019ll also visit the U.S. embassy and meet with U.S. embassy staff.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Building on the Vice President\u2019s recent, very successful visit to Cairo, the Secretary will discuss a range of issues with the Egyptians, including regional issues of mutual concern such as Libya and Syria, our shared commitment to fighting terrorism, Israeli-Palestinian issues and our efforts to move the prospects for peace forward, and other topics pertaining to the bilateral relationship and how it can be further strengthened.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And now, finally, a look at Kuwait.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOUR:</strong> The Secretary will visit Kuwait, and his visit there really has four key components. There is a \u2013 as you know, global conference on defeating ISIL that will take place. There is an Iraq reconstruction event that he will participate in. He will have bilateral meetings with the Kuwaiti relationship, and he will have a number of separate bilateral meetings with other non-Kuwaiti leaders who are also in the country for those two events that I mentioned at the top.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>It\u2019s no coincidence that the Secretary will have these types of engagements in Kuwait. Kuwait\u2019s a very strong and steady regional partner; hosts the fourth-largest number of U.S. troops anywhere in the world; has been a strong partner in the counter-ISIL coalition, and is also a leader on humanitarian issues in the region, as evidenced by its strong support for Syrian refugees and other humanitarian events. Kuwait\u2019s also been the mediator of the Gulf crisis, or the Qatar dispute, as it is sometimes called. And when the Secretary is in Kuwait and in his meetings with the Kuwaitis, he will also want to talk about next steps in terms of resolving the U.S. \u2013 sorry, the Qatar dispute, taking advantage of Kuwait\u2019s leadership and mediation. He\u2019ll also talk about recent sale of F/A-18s that the Kuwaitis are purchasing from the United States, which is a $5 billion deal and will bring many jobs to the American defense sector.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right. And lastly --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> So let me just briefly touch upon the counter-ISIS meeting and then very briefly on some of the Iraq reconstruction meeting. So obviously, the defeat of ISIS is one of the President\u2019s top foreign policy priorities, and about a year ago in March, the Secretary gathered all members of our coalition here at the State Department for a pretty historic meeting, and the point of that was really to look ahead at the next year. The focus on that meeting was very heavily on Mosul, which was an ongoing battle at the time, and also Raqqa, which we knew we\u2019d have to get after over the course of the coming year. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At that meeting, we raised about $2.3 billion of critical funding needs. And what that money did over the last year was help ensure that as we completed the military campaign in Mosul and Raqqa, we were also prepared for the humanitarian outgrowth of displaced persons. So in Mosul, for example, we had 1 million IDPs, and every single IDP \u2013 displaced person \u2013 from Mosul received humanitarian assistance and aid.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Over the last year \u2013 and I think it\u2019s also notable at that meeting in September<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, we had most members of the National Security Council, the cabinet here \u2013 Secretary Mattis, Director Coats and others \u2013 to talk about all we had to do to really strangle ISIS. And over the last year, we really accelerated the campaign. About 50 percent of all the gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria came over the last year \u2013 7.7 million people who used to be living under ISIS and are no longer, about 5 million of them were freed from ISIS over the last year. And the return of displaced to territories that used to be held by ISIS also accelerated this past year, 3.2 million Iraqis now back in their homes in areas that used to be controlled by ISIS. So pretty significant progress over the last year, which we want to kind of do a brief look back as we then look ahead. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019ve also added a number of members to the coalition since that gathering in March of last year, and that includes Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, and also NATO. That\u2019s significant because this is not just a fight, of course, in Iraq and Syria; it truly is a global campaign. This is now the largest coalition of its kind in history, with about 74 members, and as the Secretary cohosts this meeting in Kuwait, part of the focus will be making sure we really focus on the global nature of the campaign. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So there will be really two main elements of the meeting in Kuwait \u2013 the counter-ISIS ministerial. First will be focusing on consolidating the gains in Iraq and Syria, a heavy focus on stabilization and some funding gaps that we hope to close over the course of the next year. The coalition also importantly will endorse a guiding principles document for what we want to do together over the next year, and that will focus much more on law enforcement intelligence sharing, the very difficult work to make sure that we are catching these people as they cross borders, and doing all we can to protect our homeland. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So not only Iraq and Syria, but a real kind of emphasis over the next year on the global nature of the campaign \u2013 the foreign fighters, counter-messaging, intelligence and law enforcement cooperation. And our CT bureau and Ambassador Sales will be hosting a very important meeting of law enforcement officials from our coalition here next month. So that will be a key theme. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Very briefly, on the Iraq reconstruction conference, the Government of Iraq is working with the Government of Kuwait and the World Bank for this conference. It\u2019ll be held over the course of three days to bring together the donor community, civil society, and the private sector. The first day of the Kuwait reconstruction conference is focused on NGOs; the second day, private sector; and the third day, a meeting of government leaders. So Secretary Tillerson and other high level government representatives will attend the event, along with a really unprecedented 2,300 private sector representatives, high-ranking officials from regional governments, and representatives from international financial institutions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>There will be about a hundred American companies traveling to Kuwait for this event, and I think what you will see is a really innovative approach in terms of long-term post conflict reconstruction. And if you think of the template of these two meetings, the counter-ISIS meeting is focused on the immediate stabilization needs, and the reconstruction meeting is looking longer term. And this is not a program of direct U.S. Government contribution to projects; this is rather a more innovative approach focused on long-term financing, improving Iraq\u2019s macroeconomic stability, which we\u2019ve been doing through the IMF and the World Bank and others, to make sure that they are able to finance their long-term reconstruction needs. And I think there will be some fairly significant announcements coming out of those meetings, which I \u2013 which I won\u2019t get ahead of the Secretary, but that\u2019ll be quite important.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And back to the moderator.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>All right, thank you very much, and we\u2019ll now open this up for questions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone phone, *1. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating you\u2019ve been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the # key. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press *1 at this time. One moment, please, for the first question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Lee with AP. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi there, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve got three, but they\u2019re very brief. First of all, this trip, the Secretary\u2019s going to three of Israel\u2019s four neighbors. I\u2019m just curious as to why he is not going to Israel, particularly since the Kuwait stop seems to focus on the fourth of Israel\u2019s neighbor. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Secondly, [Senior State Department Official Five], on the announcements in Kuwait, I realize you don\u2019t want to get into specifics, but those would be private sector announcements or IMF/ World Bank types? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And the last one, for SAO One, [Senior State Department Official One], the MOU in Jordan \u2013 has there been any thought given to moving some of the UNRWA money that\u2019s on hold now to either Jordan or Lebanon to help them deal with whatever shortfall there might be for the Palestinians in both those countries? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> So, Matt, I\u2019ll take my two questions together. On the question of Israel, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fact that there\u2019s no Israel stop. These are always very complicated itineraries to pull together. The Secretary meets relatively frequently with Israeli officials when they\u2019re in town and stays abreast of the issues. So I wouldn\u2019t reach any conclusions about the fact that there\u2019s no Israel stop on this particular trip. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On the question of UNRWA, the MOU doesn\u2019t really deal with UNRWA money, although I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 I don\u2019t think that was your point. But the whole question of how we handle UNRWA funds in general, and then specifically for a country like Jordan, is something we\u2019re studying right now, at the White House particularly. And we\u2019ll reach some conclusions and formula on that soon I believe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE: </strong>Yeah, just briefly. So the IMF program, the Iraqis concluded a standby arrangement with the IMF, which we have \u2013 we\u2019re of course very much a part of helping facilitate. And that\u2019s delivered already about $2 billion in financing and projected to result in about $5.4 billion in budgetary support. That\u2019s the type of stuff that is far more important than the direct \u2013 than the direct contributions. We\u2019ve also provided a sovereign loan guarantee, which helped the Iraqis have a very successful billion-dollar unsupported bond sale back earlier last summer in August. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are the types of things that we\u2019re really focused on here. So working with EXIM Bank and OPIC and others and the private sector to have a more kind of really innovated approach working very closely with the Iraqi Government and its reforms and the World Bank, and its kind of vision over the next couple decades for how it intends to reconstruct and finance its reconstruction. So that\u2019s the focus of the meeting, and I think it will be quite interesting for those who follow these types of issues.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Also just finally, we\u2019ve done a lot of work in the region. Obviously, Secretary Tillerson was very focused early on on the opening between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The Secretary was in Saudi Arabia about three or four months ago for a pretty historic meeting King Salman and Prime Minister Abadi. And since then, we\u2019ve seen the opening of border crossings between Iraq and Saudi Arabia that have been closed for three decades, direct flights between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. And again, those are the types of things that are critical to Iraq\u2019s long-term reconstruction needs, and we look forward to of course seeing the Saudis at the meeting here in Kuwait over the coming days.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong> Thank you. Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Our next question comes from the line of Arshad Mohammed with Reuters. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good morning. Two topics I wanted to raise. One, with regard to Turkey, is the Secretary going to seek a commitment from the Turkish Government not to continue onto Manbij in its activities or its intervention in northern Turkey? And if he is not going to seek such an explicit commitment, is he going to seek at least some kind of commitment to pull back or restrain those activities by the Turks? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then secondly, for official number two, you made no explicit mention of the human rights situation in Egypt and the deterioration in that during Sisi\u2019s rule. And I wonder if you are going to explicitly raise those issues, and particularly, the issues of trying to achieve a fully free and fair election environment in a country where, as you\u2019re well aware, the \u2013 one of the main challengers to President Sisi was effectively prevented from appealing his disqualification because his lawyer got beaten up on the way to launch that appeal.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>So on your first question, I think what we\u2019ve said to the Turks in privately \u2013 in private has been exactly what we\u2019ve said to them in public, which is: we are urging them to show restraint in their operations in Efrin, and to show restraint further along the line across the border in northern Syria. Obviously, we need to work with the Turks to figure out more about what their long-term intentions are, and we need to work with the Turks more to figure out a way if there\u2019s a way that we can \u2013 that we can work with them to address their legitimate security concerns while, at the same time, minimizing civilian casualties and above all else keeping everything focused on the defeat ISIS fight, which is not over. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So that\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation. Turkish rhetoric has obviously been very hot on this topic, and so that\u2019s part of the value of going out, sitting down face to face, and talking through what our potential areas for cooperation are and what hard messages we need to give to them about restraint and focus. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>In terms of Egypt, concerns about human rights and civil society are a topic of continuing conversation with the Egyptians, and I imagine will be a topic that will be discussed on this upcoming visit. On the elections, we support a genuine and a credible electoral process, and we believe should guarantee the right for all citizens to participate freely and fairly. As we do around the world, we urge the Egyptian Government to respect freedom of expression, which is a fundamental pillar for any democratic society. And we have noted our concerns about the reports that Egypt\u2019s prosecutor general has launched an investigation into opposition figures ahead of the March 26th through 28th elections. These types of issues will be discussed on this visit.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Our next question comes from Carol Morello with <em>Washington Post</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I was just looking for a little more detail on both countries you\u2019ve already discussed. In Turkey, given that relationships \u2013 the relationship seems really near the breaking point, where does the Secretary see room to ease tension and for things to improve, given that the government allied press is calling the United States the enemy. And while he\u2019s there, does \u2013 given that Turkey has spoken with Iranian leaders recently, does he have any intention to talk about prisoners or a prisoner swap?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah, I mean, you\u2019re right to point out that particularly the issue of \u2013 particularly the issue of human rights and the arrest of our citizens and our locally engaged staff, that\u2019s first on the agenda on the bilateral package, and there\u2019s no pulling punches on that. We\u2019ve been very public in our call to the Turks to let these folks go, and we\u2019ve been very firm in our private conversations with them as well. That\u2019s an issue that\u2019s going to be a difficult one to work through, but it\u2019s one that we take seriously, because we have no higher priority than the safety of our people overseas. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With regard to the broader bilateral relationship, look, it\u2019s difficult. The rhetoric is hot, the Turks are angry and this is a difficult time to do business, but it\u2019s our belief that there are still some very fundamental underlying shared interests that we have with the Turks, in terms of stability in Syria, defeating ISIS, fighting the PKK and broader questions of regional balance of power, where the Turks play an important role. So, at times like this, engagement is all the more important, but you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our next question comes from Felicia Schwartz with <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks so much for taking the question. One, I think for [Senior State Department Official Five]. I understand that the U.S. isn\u2019t going to be making a government contribution, but will other governments be making contributions at the reconstruction conference. And then, secondly, what \u2013 I guess this would be for [Senior State Department Official One] \u2013 in terms of \u2013 beyond UNRWA, what\u2019s the status of the deliberations on the broader aid to the Palestinians? I see the 251 million figure on foreign assistance back up, and if Tillerson is meeting with both counterparts in Kuwait, will he be making an ask of those countries to give more to the Palestinians if the U.S. is considering pulling back?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE: </strong>So, in terms of the \u2013 again, I just emphasized, I mean, the first day of the reconstruction conference is NGO\u2019s and we are of course the largest contributor to Iraqi humanitarian assistance, and \u2013 through various NGO\u2019s and the UN and others. But we\u2019re focusing our efforts here and we\u2019ve worked very closely with the Iraqis on this, on the kind of longer-term financing and what we can do to help them there. So again, that\u2019s going to be or focus. Yes, I do think there is a World Bank kind of project list that I think some governments and participants will be quite interested in, and contributing in, as well this unprecedented number of private sector companies that will be coming.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE</strong>: On the assistance \u2013 so our, certainly our internal deliberations about Palestinian assistance issues are ongoing, both internally and ultimately with the Hill. I think the Secretary \u2013 I think it\u2019s safe to say, in the Secretary\u2019s conversations with his counterparts, there will be a focus on this question of burden sharing, both in terms of assistance for UNRWA, for things like humanitarian aid in Gaza, which is urgently needed, and that has been expressed and discussed very clearly at the most senior level, and I\u2019m sure that will come up as well. And then the broader question of various forms of assistance for the Palestinians in the West Bank. Finding ways that other partners can step up and contribute, that\u2019ll be part of that discussion.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question comes from Gardiner Harris with <em>New York Times</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you guys just talk about the general mood of this visit? Last year, of course, the President had a euphoric trip to the region, to Saudi Arabia (inaudible), but it \u2013 you\u2019ve \u2013 talking certainly about hard conversations in Turkey, but you\u2019re going to be having hard conversations at every one of these stops. In Jordan, the king, of course, is upset about the Jerusalem decision and is going to be struggling with the UNRWA decision, because many of the people who are educated and get health care through UNRWA live in his country, the same in Lebanon. In Kuwait it sounds like you\u2019re not getting the assistance help for Iraq that you hoped. So isn\u2019t it the case that the Secretary is going at a time of sort of deep difficulty for the United States, or at least a \u2013 there\u2019s a much different mood about this meeting than there was at this time or a little bit last year?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, this is [Senior State Department Official One] here. Just \u2013 I would only say you\u2019re right. This is \u2013 these are really tough issues and these are going to be tough conversations. The Secretary is going to do some very difficult, serious diplomacy. These are some of our closest partners, but they\u2019re also partners with whom we\u2019re facing some of the toughest issues that we have to face in the region, whether it\u2019s terrorism, whether it\u2019s the future of U.S. assistance, whether it\u2019s the final defeat of ISIS, whether it\u2019s maintaining partnership with an important NATO ally. All of these are, I think, emblematic of the need and the necessity for the Secretary to be out there doing face-to-face diplomacy with his counterparts.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOUR:</strong> Gardiner, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a particularly tough conversation with the Kuwaitis. There aren\u2019t a lot of bilateral irritants in the relationship. I mean, one area that we\u2019re working on with many of our partners globally is reducing DPRK presence in countries. Kuwait is moving out on that front. We\u2019re going to ask them to do \u2013 to sort of close that issue out, but they\u2019ve been very, very responsive to that endeavor. And once again, Kuwait is a platform here for some really important events and discussions, so I don\u2019t think \u2013 and particularly on the Kuwait stop \u2013 that there will be any really difficult conversations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would just add to [Senior State Department Official One]\u2019s point that the underlying point here of the visit to Turkey is that this is an important NATO ally, one of our most important allies in the world and certainly in the region; and while we\u2019re having tough times, this is the time to go out and talk with them through the brass tack issues that we have to get through.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> Just to echo number three on Kuwait \u2013 so on ISIS, compared to where we were a year ago, it\u2019s a much different conversation. A year ago we were facing very serious threats to our homelands, particularly out of Raqqa and the environs of Raqqa. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the last year, but one of the key themes, obviously, will be that this is not over. There\u2019s still fighting in eastern Syria, and we\u2019re not going to quit until that is done. But in terms of the coalition, it is about as united as I\u2019ve ever seen it. It continues to grow and has very broad political support across the board globally. So I think that\u2019ll be an important theme.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And on the Iraq conference, this isn\u2019t like a snapshot and this is the one three-day period in which everything that will be done for Iraq reconstruction will happen in this three days. It\u2019s actually quite the opposite. As we move out of the period of very intense counter-ISIS operations and focus on stabilization, we\u2019re now shifting to longer term. The Iraqis with the World Bank will roll out kind of their vision for the future of how to do this, and this will then be a longer-term process, so it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 it\u2019s the beginning of a foundation for longer-term reconstruction. And I think given the level of participation, which is really quite extraordinary, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019ll be a very good start.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. We have time for one final question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our last question comes from Francesco Fontemaggi with AFP. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you for taking my questions. These meetings are coming amid a deterioration of the situation in Syria \u2013 in many parts of Syria. So what the coalition as coalition can try to do? You\u2019ve been issuing several warnings in the last days and weeks, but what can the coalition do? And thirdly, are you just going to ask them for restraint, or do you think that the operation in Afrin, which has now been lasting for a while, has to come to an end? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I\u2019ll start on Afrin. Obviously, you start with asking for restraint and look for ways that you can help bring it to an end as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t want to prejudge any of these conversations that the Secretary may have, but obviously, the quicker we come to a resolution on that situation, the better it is for the broader effort.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> I would just \u2013 you asked about the coalition. So the coalition is focused on fighting ISIS, and our military coalition \u2013 to the extent our military is on the ground in Syria \u2013 the mission is to fight ISIS, as Secretary Mattis re-emphasized yesterday. Our mission in Syria is to defeat ISIS and ensure it is an enduring defeat of ISIS, which is where stabilization comes in. So that is the focus of the meetings of the counter-ISIS coalition, and obviously, the broader Syria issues will be discussed in bilats and other forums.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for calling in today and thank you to our speakers for sharing their time this morning, and the embargo is now lifted. Have a good day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">\n\t<span><span></span></span>\n\n\t<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"100%\"><span><span> </span></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><a name=\"_ftn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span>[1]</span></a> March</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

You may be seated. Thank you so much for joining us, everyone, on this working visit of the U.S. Secretary of State to Jamaica. The Prime Minister will make some remarks, followed by Secretary Tillerson.\n\n\n<p>\n\tPrime Minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Members of the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It was my great pleasure to welcome Secretary of State Tillerson to Jamaica and to host him and his delegation on this brief but historic working visit to Jamaica. Secretary Tillerson and I have engaged in critical discussions on issues of mutual interest to Jamaica and the United States, as well as the region, with a focus on promoting a peaceful, prosperous, energy-secure, and democratic hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmong the specific matters discussed were strengthening security cooperation in order to more effectively combat transnational organized crime; boosting the U.S.-Jamaica economic partnership; exploring opportunities to broaden U.S.-CARICOM engagement; energy security; the economic vulnerability of middle-income countries, including climatic events; de-risking and correspondent banking issues; and of course, the situation in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur talks reflected Jamaica\u2019s long and productive relationship with the United States and signaled the importance of the strong and vibrant partnership that exists between our two countries. I highlighted the common values we share based on our geographic proximity, our strong historical and cultural ties, our robust trade, tourism and investment relations, our large Jamaican diaspora in the USA, and our strong record of people-to-people contacts at all levels.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI expressed gratitude on behalf of the government and people of Jamaica for the high levels of support provided by the United States to Jamaica over the years, especially in the areas which have assisted in meeting our national development goals. In particular, we have greatly valued America\u2019s efforts to disrupt transnational crime through continued support to effectively secure Jamaica\u2019s maritime space. We agreed to deepen our cooperation in this regard, acknowledging also that the sharing and exchange of intelligence is critical to safely \u2013 is critical to the safety and security of our two countries and the wider region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to our economic partnership, Secretary Tillerson and I both agreed that the transformation of Jamaica\u2019s energy sector is critical to the achievement of our development objectives, including resilience. I expressed the hope that the U.S. will continue to support our thrust towards energy independence in the region, including greater efficiency in energy use and greater in cooperation of renewable energy sources. I expressed the hope that the United States will strengthen its economic partnerships and participation in the region in the interests of our respective countries and peoples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, we used the opportunity to discuss diaspora matters and the invaluable contribution of Jamaicans resident in the United States, including those engaged in service sectors of critical importance to the United States economy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson reiterated the concern of the U.S. Government on the political and economic crisis in Venezuela and the impact on the most vulnerable. We both agreed that positive engagement between the government and the opposition in Venezuela is essential, and expressed regret that the attempts of the OAS to promote dialogue have not been met with success. At the conclusion of our meeting, we agreed that the Government of Venezuela must act in the best interest of its people and that it should ensure that the presidential elections are free, fair, and credible in the eyes of the Venezuelan people and the international community.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, I thank you for visiting Jamaica today, as we work towards a shared vision of peaceful, prosperous, energy-secure, and a democratic hemisphere. I thank you for the frank and candid dialogue and the spirit of cooperation which have made our talks constructive and fruitful. I look forward to continuing the vibrant partnership enjoyed between Jamaica and the United States in the years ahead. I thank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, first, let me begin by thanking the prime minister for a very warm welcome to Jamaica and for the hospitality shown to myself and my delegation. This is indeed my first visit to Jamaica, although I shared with him some of my family members have been here. I think they have more vacation days than I do. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut indeed, it really is a pleasure to be here and, as the prime minister indicated, have a very, very far-reaching, comprehensive discussion and exchange on important issues to both of our countries, but also to take note of the strong record of cooperation that exists between the United States and Jamaica. And as most of you know, this is the concluding stop on a trip that I\u2019ve taken throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, and this stop I think is important because Jamaica is our closest partner in this region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States understands the importance of \u2013 that our security and prosperity are very closely tied to that of our Caribbean neighbors, and we\u2019re glad to have the partner we have in Jamaica. And I noted that the prime minister is assuming the chairmanship of CARICOM, and so I think it made our discussions even that much more timely and useful. Because we did speak about the region more broadly, as well, beyond just Jamaica and the U.S. relations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe did talk about several aspects of the U.S.-Jamaica bilateral relationship, and our view is of the outsized role that Jamaica does play in the region as a leader to other countries here in the Caribbean Basin. Through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, the United States and the Caribbean have really taken great strides in unifying our approach to regional security, but we discussed ways in which we could take that further and do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the Jamaican Government\u2019s commitment to countering narcotics trafficking and transnational criminal organizations and the cooperation that we already enjoy, but we also see many, many opportunities to enhance that cooperation to be even more effective in disrupting these illegal organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the Government of Jamaica has made important progress combatting the lotto scams, cooperating closely with U.S. authorities to extradite suspected lotto scammers to the United States and establishing a bilateral lotto scam task force, and we welcome that. The U.S. Government will continue to support Jamaica\u2019s security forces and criminal justice system. It is in both of our countries\u2019 interests to work together to investigate crimes, share intelligence, conduct asset seizures where legally and appropriate to do so, and bolster existing anti-corruption and anti-gang programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to our focus on regional security, as the prime minister indicated, we had a very comprehensive discussion on ways to promote increased energy independence not just for Jamaica, but throughout the Caribbean. And we stand ready to assist with Jamaica and other partners in the Caribbean to explore and develop the resources they have, but also to share the abundance of resources that North America enjoys and the continent enjoys. Jamaica is developing new wind, solar, and gas \u2013 natural gas capabilities, all of which are going to serve the Jamaican people better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, as mentioned to the prime minister and Minister Johnson Smith, the United States appreciates Jamaica adding its voice to the major issues affecting our region, and the prime minister just spoke very eloquently about the concern we all share regarding the situation in Venezuela. Jamaica\u2019s votes in the OAS to achieve stability, prosperity, and support democracy in Venezuela have demonstrated exceptional support to the human rights issues that confront us in the Western Hemisphere. We will continue to ask our partners to support the people of Venezuela during this very trying time for them, and we will continue \u2013 the United States will \u2013 to put pressure on the Maduro regime to return its country to free, open, and democratic elections. The people of Venezuela deserve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today, we\u2019ll continue to work hand in hand to advance regional security cooperation, build economic partnerships. We have so much more to do together, and thank you again, Prime Minister, for the very warm welcome. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you so much, Secretary Tillerson, and Prime Minister. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll open the floor for some questions. Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson, we have members of the overseas traveling media as well as our local media entities here with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have \u2013 again, the rules, you raise your hand, I\u2019ll identify you, and then when you \u2013 the microphone is brought to you, could you please identify yourself, your media entity, and ask succinctly your question to the leaders? I see a hand over there, if we could get the microphone that side, please. Ms. Chisholm, in the back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, good afternoon. Andrea Chisholm from Television Jamaica. Secretary Tillerson, at the United Nations prior to the vote on Jerusalem, the U.S. ambassador to the UN said that we are watching, and many saw that as a threat to small and developing countries. Then there are some who classify Haiti, one of our CARICOM partners, as \u201cblank-hole\u201d countries. How should we perceive your visit today and how can Caribbean countries think that you respect us and it\u2019s not more of the United States just throwing their power around?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I\u2019m here to reinforce the partnership and how we view the partnerships with Jamaica, but also with the entire Caribbean region, as I just indicated in my remarks. This is an important region to us. As we discussed today, this is the United States\u2019 third border, and Jamaica has the largest stretch of that third border with the United States \u2013 very important to our national security but also important to future economic opportunity as well. So the U.S. sees many, many opportunities for furthering our cooperation on trade, for strengthening our security cooperation, and most particularly, for combating these transnational criminal organizations that bring nothing but problems and violence and devastation to Jamaica and the region, but also certainly to the homeland for the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we seek to strengthen this \u2013 our partnerships in the region, and we see many, many opportunities to do so, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re really excited about the prime minister assuming chairmanship of CARICOM and it\u2019s why \u2013 one of the reasons why I really wanted to meet with him today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Secretary Tillerson. I recognize CBS. I believe you had a hand up. Could you identify yourself formally, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, hi, Kylie Atwood with CBS News. Thank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister, I have a question for you first. The U.S. is continuing to look for ways to build up opposition and to economically isolate the Maduro regime in Venezuela. You\u2019ve stated that you support the U.S. in those efforts today, but is Jamaica willing and able to stop importing Venezuelan oil?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Secretary Tillerson, a question for you: How would the U.S. be able to support the Caribbean and Jamaica specifically if you\u2019re asking them to cut down on the amount of oil that they\u2019re importing from Jamaica? Could the U.S. provide any subsidized oil to Jamaica and these other countries? What are you thinking about as possibilities? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Jamaica supports human rights, Jamaica supports peace in this region, and Jamaica wants to see the people of Venezuela being able to enjoy their democracy. This is a principle that has nothing to do with any other country. This has always been Jamaica\u2019s position. We wish the best for the people of Venezuela. We now don\u2019t hardly import oil from Venezuela. With the new dynamics in the global trade and energy and with the United States now becoming a net exporter of energy resources, Jamaica can, in this new paradigm, benefit from that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Secretary?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as the prime minister, I think, made the point in his remarks, this is one of the things that binds Jamaica and the U.S. so closely, is strong commitment to democratic values. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re just both heartbroken to see what\u2019s happening in Venezuela, as we\u2019re seeing what was once a thriving democracy dismantled before our very eyes. It\u2019s the reason we intend to take all actions possible to persuade the regime to return to its full constitutional authorities, return it to the hands of the Venezuelan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs to any future steps that the U.S. might take regarding sanctioning oil or products to put more pressure on the Maduro regime, we are going to take into full consideration the impacts on regional countries as well. And we had a good exchange today regarding that issue not just for Jamaica, but also getting the prime minister\u2019s perspective on other countries, how they might be affected. And we will be looking at what are actions the U.S. might take to mitigate the negative impacts of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t want to get into specifics because we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to undertake a very quick study to see: Are there some things that the U.S. could easily do with our rich energy endowment, with the infrastructure that we already have available \u2013 what could we do to perhaps soften any impact of that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, I think there is \u2013 there\u2019s great unanimity in the region and certainly in the hemisphere that we all want to see some progress on this situation in Venezuela, which only gets worse day by day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Secretary Tillerson and Prime Minister. I recognize at the back Mr. Campbell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Edmond Campbell, Gleaner Company. Good afternoon, Secretary of State and Prime Minister Holness. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in December of last year rejecting the American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. But prior to that vote, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, she warned countries not \u2013 well, to vote with the U.S., or not to vote against the U.S., or the U.S. might be withdrawing aid from such countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, is that a policy position of the U.S.?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Prime Minister Holness, could you just explain to us specifically why it is that Jamaica sat on the fence in that particular vote? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think President Trump actually addressed this in his State of the Union speech the other night when he said we need to undertake a re-examination of how the United States provides aid around the world globally, and not just for this particular issue, but more broadly in terms of: As we provide significant assistance to countries, are these countries that align with our values? Are they countries that align with what we believe are ways to make the world a safer and more prosperous place?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think it\u2019s in that context that I would answer your question, as it\u2019s not been examined in quite some time, if ever, in terms of: How does the United States want to think about the generosity of the American people, because this is the American people\u2019s money that\u2019s being provided to others, and what should the expectation be around \u2013 what are we supporting?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so as the President stated in his State of the Union address, he\u2019s asked that we consider that question. There has been no new policy adopted at this point, but he\u2019s asked us to think about all of our elements of our aid programs, and are they really advancing and promoting the values that the American people want to see advanced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Edmond, Jamaica was one of several countries in the Caribbean region that abstained. From our perspective, from a diplomatic perspective, Jamaica did not need to take a position on another country\u2019s position on where they would want to see as a capital in the world. So from our perspective, this was not an issue that Jamaica should take a position on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd generally speaking, Jamaica conducts its foreign policy on principle. We are not conducting foreign policy for aid or for special benefits. So I want to make that position very clear to the Jamaican people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson. And given our time issue, let\u2019s take a final question. The gentleman with the beard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Oh, another question. I thought we were done. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello, Mr. Secretary, the gentleman with the beard. (Laughter.) I am Dave Clark from Agence France-Presse. The question\u2019s actually for Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. Prime Minister, when we were with the Secretary in Mexico last week, Foreign Minister Videgaray said that if America went ahead and expelled more than a million so-called Dreamers, that this would be a win for Mexico, a massive injection of human capital, and a loss for the United States, because they\u2019d be losing a lot of valuable workers. You yourself have just spoken about the large Jamaican diaspora in the United States. From your perspective, if the United States were to halt or reverse immigration from Jamaica and the Caribbean, would that be a loss for the United States or would that be a loss for Jamaica? And how do you feel when the President of the United States is reported as saying he would prefer immigrants from Norway? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Well, you raise a very interesting question. We, in Jamaica, have struggled with the reverse of immigration, which is the loss of tremendous talent and human resource, much of which we pay for. We call it the brain drain. At the same time, the Government of Jamaica would not want to see people deprived of their dreams and aspirations and ambitions. But from a government perspective, we are a practical government. And as we look on as to what another independent country would do with their internal foreign policy, we stand ready to welcome all our Jamaicans, and we want our diaspora to continue to support and participate in Jamaica.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou mentioned an important thing, Secretary Tillerson. You say, America the homeland. Jamaica is the homeland for Jamaicans, and we would want to have their skills and their resources here. And we support them as well in their dreams to settle and work in other countries, and we encourage them to abide by the laws and institutions of that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong></span><span><span> Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister and Secretary Tillerson.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

U.S. Department of State officials continue to engage diplomatically with host governments and through bilateral and multilateral partners to end this practice. In 2017, the Department contributed $5,000,000 to UN efforts combatting FGM/C, and its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices include country-by-country information on the prevalence of the practice and international efforts taken to combat it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBuilding on investments made in previous years to address the problem, we continue to advance initiatives to support survivor-centered programs in countries where FGM/C is most prevalent. The Department\u2019s programs promote the abandonment of FGM/C and work with communities and civil society organizations to increase their capacity to implement laws and legislation prohibiting it. This fiscal year, USAID is launching a three-year pilot activity in Kenya aimed at combatting FGM/C and child marriage by tackling the root causes and social motivators that drive these practices, including women\u2019s lack of agency, unresponsive health services, inactive protection networks, and limited economic opportunities for women and girls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe advancement of women and girls is essential to peace, prosperity, and security. We remain committed in our efforts to combat all forms of gender-based violence, including FGM/C. Today, we renew the call for zero tolerance to end this harmful procedure that affects women and girls in far too many places across the globe.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

We thank you for being here for the meeting of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of North America: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canada, Chrystia Freeland, the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico Luis Videgaray Caso.\n\n\n<p>\n\tWe would like to ask the ministers to get to the podium.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow we are going to listen to Mr. Chancellor Luis Videgaray Caso.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I\u2019m going to speak in Spanish, so I\u2019m going to wait for you to have the correct translation. Good afternoon for all the media. I am very glad to give \u2013 and welcome the Secretary of the United States Mr. Rex Tillerson and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland from Canada. It\u2019s not the first time they are here in Mexico. We are very glad to welcome them again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we are happy to have the opportunity to work in different topics that are important for our North American region. North America \u2013 we are convinced that it can be the most competitive region of the world in the next decades, and that\u2019s why we are working. We are working in a framework not only of neighborhood, but of friendship, of collaboration, and the sovereignty of the countries, knowing that together we can do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the conversations that we\u2019ve had today, of course, competitiveness is the core topic. How are we going to work together to generate more economic activities, more jobs for the inhabitants of this region? One of the topics of competitiveness where we can have an opportunity, an important opportunity, is the topic of energy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe North American region has the capabilities in human and the natural resources to be a very clean energy and cheap energy to be able to transform our societies and our economies. We have agreed to keep on working with the works of our secretaries, and we are also having the objective of getting to the regulations to generate the \u2013 and create the synergies where we can have a mutual construction of infrastructure, and of course, to enable the private sector, which is going to be able to create projects not only from hydrocarbons but also from the energy sector in clean energies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the commercial area, we see an important opportunity in the modernization of the Free Trade Agreement of North America, which is NAFTA. And this is going to be led by the corresponding areas of the government. We are making progress in a professional way, and from the Mexican Government we see a great opportunity to have a win-win-win situation \u2013 where Mexico wins, when Canada wins, and where the United States wins. We don\u2019t see it as a game where someone loses and someone wins. We want a modern agreement to be up to the situation of the 21st century. The North American Free Trade Agreement was agreed 25 years ago; it was a different world then. And now we have the opportunity to adapt it to the new reality, to have an agreement that is fair and that is reciprocal, to have trade based on rules, these rules that are going to allow this region to be \u2013 prosper and to keep generating jobs and welfare for the three parts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important part of the welfare of our region is the empowerment of women, entrepreneur women. And we agreed on working with them according to the mechanisms that are already established to have an agreement between the three countries. We had a meeting a few days ago of the empowerment of women in Mexico, and we are going to keep working on these important topics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother important topic of the region is the \u2013 that is, the interest of the three countries is the safety. We identified as an important tool in the matter of drugs, and we have celebrated three meetings. We are going to hold the fourth meeting this year in Canada, and we agreed on having a special emphasis on the combat that we are having against the epidemic of opioids and fentanyl and heroin. This is generating a great damage of our citizens. In Mexico, it\u2019s taking the lives of lots of youngsters, and also in the United States and Canada due to the use of these substances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we are going to continue working like last year with our United States Department to have a cooperation which is much more effective, knowing that we have a shared responsibility, and using the trilateral platform to exchange information and have the operational cooperation as well. We also talked about the efforts that we are doing jointly in the illegal human trafficking, which is a priority for the three parts, and we agreed on working on this topic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the meeting that we held trilaterally, we talked about important topics of our region, and I mean we are talking about three topics \u2013 the cooperation in Central America region. The initiative of Secretary Tillerson and John Kelly held a summit in Miami last year about the cooperation for Central America. Minister Freeland was there too, and we are working on knowing how are we going to work beyond the security issues, how are we going to contribute for the development, the economic development and the stability and the security of this place, especially from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. We agreed on working on what we are left to do, and we are going to take it as an important matter of our trilateral cooperation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also agreed on working with the cooperation initiatives in the Caribbean. This Caribbean region is strategic area which is going to face specific challenges. We are talking about the increase of the cooperation, our shared cooperation, to have a better resilience on the Caribbean islands against the natural phenomena which are derived from the climate change, and also strengthen the energy security in the Caribbean. We can do a lot of things. And each one of our governments have direct relationships with the Caribbean, but we need an effort between the United States, Canada, and Mexico in this matter, and it can be very effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd on third place, the situation of Venezuela. This is a very painful situation for our region and for our continent. We are facing the vision \u2013 one of the most important things that are at stake are the democratic system, and as part of this Inter-American Democratic Act, which is an instrument that is mandatory for the people of North America since 2001, while we cannot stay and do nothing with the situation of Venezuela. We have already confirmed our concern and our will to keep using the diplomatic tools that are at our hand to keep re-establishing the situation in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have shared with both ministers the role that Mexico played on the dialogue on the Venezuelan Government in Dominican Republic, and we decided to withdraw because there were no serious decisions made. But that does not mean that Mexico is going to keep having to stop having an active participation in Venezuela. The Venezuelan people are going to find the peaceful path, and Mexico is going to keep working with the rest of the countries of the region, of course, with the United States and Canada, to keep looking for a solution to this serious situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese are one of the topics that we mentioned with Mexico, Canada, and the United States. This is a rich cooperation. It\u2019s a very diverse cooperation. And I would like to say that Mr. Tillerson and Mrs. Freeland my gratefulness to be here. It\u2019s very important for me and for Mexico to be here. It\u2019s not just an opportunity; it\u2019s a shared commitment. Thank you very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Now we are going to listen to Mrs. Chrystia Freeland, the ministry of Canada.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. To start, I would like to thank Secretary Videgaray and the rest of our hosts here in Mexico.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Interpreter speaks in Spanish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Via interpreter, in progress) ...Mexico, the United States, and Canada is going to face a lot of challenges. The representatives of our countries are going to be having different meetings, and we should remember that we are working together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(In English) Mexico, the United States, and Canada have long been partners, allies, neighbors, and most importantly friends. We are brought together not only by the physical fact of our shared geography, but by the equally important fact of our shared values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe discussions we had today were very productive. Of course, we did touch on the NAFTA negotiations. From the very beginning, we in Canada have said that NAFTA must be updated and modernized to provide broader opportunity for the middle class and those working hard to join the middle class in all of our three countries. We are working hard for a deal that is innovative, forward-looking, and mutually beneficial for all three NAFTA partners. And here I will echo Secretary Videgaray and say we believe in a win-win-win outcome, and I am very hopeful that we can get there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of our discussion of North American competitiveness, we had an excellent conversation about energy collaboration, and I am hopeful that\u2019s something that we can carry forward from this meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also spoke about the importance of advancing democracy in the hemisphere, most notably in Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis continues to worsen. The Maduro regime is systematically violating the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people. We three agreed that we must do everything we can to restore democracy and relieve the unacceptable suffering of the people of Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also spoke about how we can cooperate to fight transnational crime, in particular the opioid crisis, which is causing such devastating harm to the people of Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, we spoke about our shared commitment to the empowerment of women and girls and discussed ways we can advance that agenda together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s always a pleasure for Canada to work with our continental partners and neighbors with whom we share so many values and interests on issues of mutual trilateral and also global concern. It\u2019s great to spend time with you, Rex, Secretary Tillerson, and thank you again, Luis, Secretary Videgaray, for hosting this great conversation. <em>Muchas gracias, amigos</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> And now we\u2019re going to thank Mr. Rex Tillerson for his message.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, first let me thank Foreign Secretary Videgaray for hosting today\u2019s trilateral, and thank Foreign Minister Freeland for making the trip down to Mexico City. In 2017, my very first bilateral visit as Secretary of State was to Mexico City, and about this time a year ago we were standing here holding a press conference. As it turns out, my very last trip of 2017 as Secretary of State was to Ottawa. So it\u2019s right that we should meet at this time in the trilateral relationship. And we meet \u2013 even when we\u2019re not meeting, I would share with you that the three of us are in very frequent contact on all issues that are of importance to our countries, on security, as well as economic prosperity, because our three countries are connected. When we can work together, and when we are unified in our positions and our voice, we have significant influence on the events not just in our hemisphere, but elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today we discussed a range of trilateral, regional, and global issues, and I cannot emphasize enough the importance of our economic relationships. Canada and Mexico rank as the first or second-largest export market for 42 U.S. states and support nearly 3 million U.S. jobs. North America is also a major player, as Secretary Videgaray highlighted, in the energy markets. And we discussed what we believe are really unique opportunities to promote market-based energy development and to further energy integration throughout North America and the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also talked and discussed following through on the 2016 trilateral MOU to economically empower women that Foreign Minister Freeland mentioned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBeyond our trade and economic relationships, we also discussed mutual areas of serious concern, in particular the most immediate threat to our hemisphere from transnational criminal organizations. We continue to employ a coordinated and multilateral approach to diminish the influence of these groups and rid our hemisphere of the violence and devastation they promote. In June of last year, Canada joined the United States and Mexico for a conference on prosperity and security in Central America. At that meeting, we secured commitments from international partners and in the private sector to address a range of issues facing the Northern Triangle governments, including economic, energy, security, and governance challenges. Today, we discussed on how we can follow up on those commitments from that conference. Success there will better protect all of our countries and provide opportunities for the citizens of Central America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGiven the deadly nature of the opioid crisis, we must do more to attack the business models of those who traffic drugs and guns. That was a major theme of the second strategic dialogue that I cohosted with Foreign Secretary Videgaray last December in Washington, D.C. Through our targeted dialogues like this and the North American Drug Dialogue, we are developing and deploying new strategies to disrupt and dismantle these deadly networks that smuggle drugs, that participate in human trafficking and other illicit activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTurning elsewhere in the hemisphere, we shared our concerns for the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in Venezuela. We all urge the Maduro regime to return to free, open, credible, democratic elections and to allow the Venezuelans a voice in their government. Our three countries will work with all members of the Lima Group to assist the Venezuelan people during this time of crisis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also expressed to Foreign Minister Freeland and Foreign Secretary Videgaray how I \u2013 how strongly I support Peru\u2019s ambitious anticorruption agenda for the Summit of the Americas later this spring. We hope leaders throughout the hemisphere will make concrete commitments to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and support economic growth and job creation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs challenges become more complex, North America and our three countries will continue to work together to find solutions. That makes meetings like we\u2019ve had today extremely valuable, and it was certainly useful to me and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with my counterparts. And thank you again for hosting, Luis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary Tillerson. Now we\u2019re going to have a question and answer session. We\u2019re going to have one question per each one of the participant countries. We\u2019re going to start with Mexico. Jorge Ramos from Grupo Imagen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. I\u2019m on your right, and my partners and I would like to know about the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and the Chancellor Videgaray and Mr. Tillerson, because they talked about the agreement for the Dreamers and the immigrants. Do you have the DACA agreement for the United States for the construction of the border wall? And have you talked about the agreement to fight against the criminal groups that are in both sides of the border, and also to stop the flow of weapons from the United States to Mexico? This is the first part.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second part is we would also like to know that \u2013 if in the agreement to try to go back to the normality in Venezuela, is there a military offensive from the United States to combat Maduro\u2019s situation, and is it going to be supported by Mexico and Canada?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd just a question for Mr. Tillerson: Is there evidence that there is going to be an interference in the Russian Government in Mexico as there was in the United States? I mean the elections of your country. And are you going to reiterate the situation that Canada and Mexico should not have a close relationship to Russia and China?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, I would like to know if there is an agreement between Mexico and the United States about the possibility of deploying guards in the transborder flights to answer to any issue that might arise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> (Via interpreter) We\u2019re going to establish a rule: If you\u2019re going to ask more than three, I\u2019m just going to answer three, all right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe didn\u2019t talk about the DACA agreement. We have talked about it before, but in the migration situation, it is a matter of the United States to agree on this, and it\u2019s the same thing in Mexico and Canada. And in the case of the DACA, of course we have shared information with members of the American Congress and \u2013 congressmen of the United States, but if the DACA people are coming back, it would be a win situation for Mexico and a lose situation for the United States. It would be one of the most important losses in humanity, because this is a situation of people who came as children and they have a clean record, most of them, and are engineers. They work in programming, they are doctors, lawyers, and of course, Mexico would be having an important win situation and lose situation for the United States. But finally, that is the decision from the United States and we are going to try to find a situation in the Congress for the future of these young people. But at the end, it\u2019s what they decide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ve talked to most of them, and most of them want to stay in the United States. Most of them want to stay there and some of them want to come back to Mexico, but it \u2013 this is not a matter of the bilateral situation. We also talked widely about this situation in this meeting, and Mr. Rex Tillerson was talking about it in \u2013 a few moments ago about the combat of the criminal groups is one of our priorities. And we want these efforts to have a more strategic planning so that we can dismantle the plans of these organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe mentioned it last year and we hope that we can have measurable results. One of the topics that we\u2019re going to mention in the dismantling of these criminal groups is going to be weapons. Of course, the illegal weapons that come from the United States to Mexico is something that should be dismantled. And we have an agreement of what the paradigm is. This paradigm should be cooperation. We should not take the guilt into someone else. The criminal groups that \u2013 and the illegal weapons from the United States, Mexico, and the cash that comes is to be able to dismantle the production and the creation of these groups. If we don\u2019t have a joint effort, we are giving a strategic opportunity to these criminal groups, and we\u2019re not going to be able to dismantle them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson is going to talk about the specific question about Venezuela, and I would like to say that Mexico is not going to support the decision that involves violence, either internal or external, for the case of Venezuela. And about the question of the special agents in the United \u2013 for the United States in trans-border flights, well, it is a proposal that has not been done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there are lots of proposals in terms of security. We are analyzing all these proposals and the operative proposals, but there is not an agreement yet. There is a conversation that is going to be taken seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Okay. So there were several questions in there. We\u2019ll see if I can remember them all. First, with respect to DACA, President Trump has put forward a proposal to the Congress that I think addresses in a very, very important way how people should be treated and the value of those people. And his proposal would remove the uncertainty for more than a million people that find themselves in this situation. And the President\u2019s been quite clear that he wants to see this solved, and he\u2019s called upon the Congress to solve it. So I think it is certainly his commitment to see this issue resolved once and for all, and provide clarity, which is so important, so that people know how to plan their lives going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the commitment to disrupt the transcriminal organizations, as I mentioned in my remarks, we created early last year \u2013 in fact, it was in this first trip that I made to Mexico City, the first bilat \u2013 a different approach as to how we cooperate to attack the entire supply chain of this devastating impact of drugs \u2013 cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, opioids. This is having a horrible effect on American citizens, Mexican citizens, Canadian citizens. And so throughout the year we have had two major follow-up meetings in Washington, D.C. We had a very important working dinner last night with the Mexican military counterparts and the navy and the Mexican army and Mexican intelligence service to discuss how we feel about the progress and what are the areas that need more attention. So this is a joint effort that is very, very active, it is very robust, and we intend to maintain this effort well in until we have resolved this problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou asked about Russian interference in Mexican elections. All I could say to you is we know that Russia has fingerprints in a number of elections around the world. We hear this from our European counterparts as well. My advice would be \u2013 to Mexico would be: Pay attention. Pay attention to what\u2019s happening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of air marshals on flights, we have air marshals on a number of flights in the United States. It\u2019s about creating security for both the arrivals and the destinations. And any action that would be taken regarding flights with Mexico will be done in full cooperation and coordination with Mexican authorities as well, all with a view that we want to provide greater security for all of our passengers that are traveling back and forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to Venezuela and what we would like to see happen there is a peaceful transition, if \u2013 if President Maduro would return to the Venezuelan constitution, restore the duly elected assembly, dismantle the illegitimate constituent assembly, and return to free, fair elections, then he\u2019s happy to stay and run in a free and fair election. If he wants to step aside and let someone else follow through on that, that\u2019s fine, but our view is you must return to the constitution, and that\u2019s what we hope Venezuela ultimately will do. That\u2019s what we all are working hard to see them do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t know if I hit all your questions. Those are the ones I could remember.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> Good enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Now our next question, Pilar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. My question is to Minister Freeland. According to the free trade agreement, the negotiation with the United States had several agreements on the United States. Would you give us an opinion about this? What is going to happen with Mexico and the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we also like to know about the renegotiation period. What are the risks that we are going to have in Mexico in the change of governments for Canada and for the United States? And we also like to know about their recent topics of the situation and told with the Minister Luis Videgaray.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> As far as NAFTA goes, as actually all three of us said, all three countries are strong believers in North American competitiveness, and we really believe that this agreement, which has now been in place for almost a quarter century, has made our continent more competitive. It has created jobs and growth in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The world has changed a lot, though, since we first negotiated NAFTA, and to give you an example, on the tracing list for cars in NAFTA today, we have cassette decks \u2013 which my children don\u2019t even know what a cassette deck is \u2013 but we don\u2019t have rear view cameras.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is time to update this agreement, to modernize it, to make it fit for the 21st century, to make it more effective for all three countries, and that is what Canada is 100 percent committed to doing. We believe that that is absolutely possible, and we are working hard with a lot of goodwill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of timelines, we would love to get this deal done as quickly as possible. Uncertainty is never good for business confidence. Having said that, it\u2019s a really complicated agreement, and we believe in taking the time it takes to get it right. So I think all of us are going to be working really, really hard to get it done as quickly as possible to get a good outcome for all three of our countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Tracy Wilkinson from the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> For Secretary Tillerson, you spoke yesterday in Austin quite eloquently, really, about the shared values of the United States with Latin America, the need to strengthen those partnerships, to build the rule of law and democratic institutions, and you also spoke, really, of the benefits of immigration. Our \u2013 all the passports of different colors that we have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDoes it undercut your message here and your efforts or mission to build on those relationships when a very different message comes from your own President, who, for example, in his State of the Union, described \u2013 painted a picture of immigration from Mexico as a cause of crime, or even today was attacking this morning the FBI and some of the very pillars of rule of law and democracy? Does that make your mission more difficult? Which \u2013 and which version should Americans believe, which version should Mexicans believe?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, for the Ministers Videgaray and Freeland, how difficult is it for you to negotiate with a government that speaks in such different voices? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think with respect to U.S. immigration policy, what the President, I think, has observed is that over the years, our immigration system has grown so many arms and legs, if you just look at the number of different programs by which people come to the United States, that oftentimes we don\u2019t have real good discipline around how those programs are enforced consistent with the laws. And in fact, as the President requested early in his term that a full review be undertaken of all the immigration policies, what we found is there were a lot of exceptions to the intent of Congress \u2013 had been put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the first thing the President has done is said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to enforce the laws.\u201d The Congress passed the laws, the executive is required to enforce the laws, and we intend to enforce them to the letter of the law. And so that\u2019s really where this whole process begins. So what we want is legal immigration, legal immigration where we understand who is entering the country, and why are they entering the country and are they coming to enjoy a nice vacation; are they coming to work here for some time; are they coming here for education or are they coming here to work; are they coming here to one day hoping to become citizens?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we really \u2013 what the President has asked is: Let\u2019s put in place systems. And that\u2019s where a lot of the new, in particular, immigration from countries that are very unstable today, that don\u2019t have strong governments themselves in parts of the world. Let\u2019s make sure we have systems in place where we understand who is coming to the United States of America, and as he indicated, we are a nation built by immigrants. All of us can trace our ancestry, or most of us can, back to someone in the family that immigrated to the United States. And we still value immigrants, and they bring enormous value to our continent. And that\u2019s what the President, though, is asking is, I want to know how this person who wants to come and live in our country is going to bring value to our country. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 fundamentally, that\u2019s what he is pursuing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd it is very complicated, because we have over the years put so many different mechanisms in place, I think well-intended, to deal with situations around the world, many of which \u2013 those situations no longer exist. And we\u2019ve never gone back and kind of cleaned this up, and gotten back to where \u2013 what was the original intent. So I know it\u2019s painful, the process is, for a lot of people, and that\u2019s why, as we move forward in implementing the President\u2019s directives, we\u2019re trying to do that in a way that accommodates the fact that this is hard for some people. How can we give them time to adjust? What can we do to fix a lot of this back in Congress?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that\u2019s why the President has been pressing Congress for a number of actions to make changes to the immigration law, to fix these defects that have risen over the years and crept into the immigration system. He wants this to be a country that\u2019s \u2013 that follows the law, and he wants us to enforce the law, and when it\u2019s not working, we should go to the Congress and say, \u201cLook, we need you to fix this part of the immigration law, whether it\u2019s on a particular program to deal with refugees or whether it\u2019s other issues like DACA, let\u2019s fix it.\u201d And instead, we\u2019ve had a long period of time where people have kind of issued a directive here and an order there, and things have kind of gotten out of \u2013 have gotten out of the normal order.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo my message \u2013 that would be my message to people trying to understand what the President\u2019s doing with immigration is let\u2019s have it very clear what the rules are. Let\u2019s enforce those rules, and then people that desire to come to the United States know exactly what the pathway is to get here, and they will have certainty when they arrive. Because we have so many people living in the country today that immigrated, and they\u2019re living under a huge cloud of uncertainty. And the President would like to remove that uncertainty for a lot of people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> Since the question was in English, I\u2019ll answer in English. Mexico will always be prepared to deal with, to work with any administration in the U.S. or in any other country around the world. And we do so because we are a sovereign nation, and we have clarity about our principles, about our objectives and the things we are willing to do and the things we are not willing to do. With the Trump administration, we\u2019ve committed to have a very close communication, and that has proven to be a tremendous benefit for the relationship. I think that in many ways, the relationship today is more fluid, it\u2019s closer than it was with previous administrations, which might be surprising to some people, but that\u2019s a fact of life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I want to highlight the role that \u2013 and leadership of Secretary Tillerson, who has been instrumental to achieving this, and to bring our countries closer. Yes, we do have some differences, as every other country does, but we\u2019ve been working very closely, we\u2019ve achieved substantial things, and we\u2019re looking into the future. This is a relationship about opportunities and about the things that we can do together, and we\u2019re working well, we\u2019re working close, and we are about results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> Yeah, and so \u2013 I think the Canadian view is very similar. Canada has been negotiating with the United States for as long as we have been a country. We feel we know you guys pretty well. In fact, we probably spend a lot more time thinking about you than you spend thinking about us. We\u2019re okay with that. When it comes to the current administration, the President\u2019s counterpart is of course my prime minister, and I\u2019ve been with my prime minister at a number of bilateral meetings. And I know that the two leaders have a very strong mutual respect for one another, and I would say, they also really get along. As for my U.S. counterparts, Luis and I are going to embarrass you, Rex, but it is a true pleasure working with Secretary Tillerson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHe is a tremendous friend and partner for Canada, and an incredibly important voice in maintaining the rules-based international order, and it\u2019s been a real privilege for me to work with him on issues ranging from peace and security on the North Korean Peninsula \u2013 we recently cohosted a summit in Vancouver on this issue. He was brave enough to come to Ottawa in December; that shows true friendship. And I am grateful both to Secretary Tillerson and to Secretary Videgaray that we three continental partners were able to have a really good meeting here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: </strong><em>Muchas gracias a todo</em>.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And thank you, Greg, for that very kind, warm introduction, inviting me back home today. And I want to thank those at the Clements Center of National Security and the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law for hosting the event as well.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs Greg mentioned to you, today does mark my one-year anniversary as Secretary of State. A year ago this time, I had entered the State Department, stood on the steps in the foyer, and had my first chance to have a conversation with my newest colleagues and friends in the State Department about things that are important to me and values that I wanted to bring to the State Department. And it\u2019s been a very busy, whirlwind year, but it\u2019s really nice to celebrate it among friends back home as well. So I\u2019m just delighted to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, it\u2019s always a special honor and pleasure to get to speak at your alma mater, and in particular, an institution that houses the presidential library of one of our most storied Texans to serve in Washington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLBJ bemoaned, as some of you may know, what he considered an East Coast, elitist approach to foreign policy. He once said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever get credit for anything I do in foreign affairs, no matter how successful it is, because I didn\u2019t go to Harvard.\u201d (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI didn\u2019t either, and worse, I\u2019m an engineer. (Laughter.) But I got one up on LBJ: He didn\u2019t go to the University of Texas. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have said before that this University shaped me in so many ways, both personal and professional. An interesting story: When I was a freshman in the Longhorn Band, a group of about one hundred members of the band flew down to Peru for a special mission trip. There had been a major earthquake in Peru, and enormous refugee problem coming out of the mountains into the area of Lima. And a group of Texans went down to help raise money and bring awareness to the situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt was an extraordinary trip \u2013 interestingly, first passport I got. Went to the passport office, got my first passport, first foreign country I ever visited was with the University of Texas Longhorn Band to Peru. And it was interesting; it was a very successful trip. The band was a huge hit down in Lima, and the U.S. ambassador to Peru even expressed he had some concerns that \u201cThe Eyes of Texas\u201d was going to replace \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d as the official \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 anthem at the events. Regrettably, we left for that trip after a loss at the Cotton Bowl, but the Showband of the Southwest won in Peru, I assure you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as I look to the coming weeks, when I will return to Peru on my first multi-stop visit to Latin America as Secretary of State, it does feel a bit like coming full circle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m proud today UT Austin\u2019s Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, its Mexico Center, and its host of international programs do contribute to educate students about this very important region of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis trip comes at an important time for the Western Hemisphere. This diverse region \u2013 which includes Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean \u2013 is a priority for the United States for reasons other than simply our geographic proximity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe share an interwoven history and chronology. Our nations still reflect the New World optimism of limitless discovery. And importantly, we share democratic values \u2013 values that are at the core of what we believe, regardless of the color of our passport.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd for generations, U.S. leaders have understood that building relationships with Latin American and Caribbean partners is integral to the success and prosperity of our region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 1889, at the urging of then-Secretary of State James Blaine, the United States hosted the First International Conference of American States \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s OAS, or Organization of American States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the beginning of the 20th century, President Teddy Roosevelt visited Panama \u2013 the first foreign visit of a U.S. sitting president in our history.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd during the 1960s, President Kennedy established the Alliance for Progress \u2013 his ambitious plan to strengthen economic cooperation among the United States and the hemisphere, and to, in his words, \u201celiminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, we share these same goals as the visionary leaders before us: to eliminate tyranny and to further the cause of economic and political freedom throughout our hemisphere. As 2018 begins, we have an historic opportunity to do just that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few weeks ago, the United States cohosted a ministerial with our counterparts in Canada in Vancouver. Twenty countries joined us to discuss the global threat posed by North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn April, Peru will host the Summit of the Americas to highlight our region\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption. Two months later, Canada will host the 44th G7 Summit. And at the end of this year, the G20 states will convene in Buenos Aires, the first South American city ever to host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in many ways, 2018 marks the year of the Americas. Many of the world\u2019s leaders will be in this hemisphere, and as such, the eyes of the world will turn to the Americas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today I want to focus on three pillars of engagement to further the cause of freedom throughout our region in 2018 and beyond: economic growth, security, and democratic governance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe hemisphere has significant potential for greater economic growth and prosperity. We will build upon the solid foundation of economic cooperation with our Latin American and Caribbean partners. Brazil, for instance, is the region\u2019s largest economy and the ninth largest in the world. The United States is Brazil\u2019s second-largest trading partner, with two-way trade at record highs in recent years totaling more than $95 billion in 2015.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries; 12 of those countries are in the Western Hemisphere. And every year, the United States trades almost $2 trillion worth of goods and services with Latin America and Caribbean nations, supporting more than 2.5 million jobs here at home. Instead of a trade deficit, we actually have a $14 billion trade surplus with the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut today we have an opportunity to further our economic partnership and the prosperity of the peoples in this hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important step to strengthen North American economic prosperity and integration is to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m a Texan, former energy executive, and I\u2019m also a rancher. I understand how important NAFTA is for our economy and that of the continent. But it should come as no surprise that an agreement put into place 30 years ago, before the advent of the digital age and the digital economy, before China\u2019s rise as the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2013 that NAFTA would need to be modernized.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur aim is simple: to strengthen our economy and that of all of North America, to remain the most competitive, economically vibrant region in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the hard work of our Mexican and Canadian counterparts throughout these negotiations. Last week, we concluded round six, and we will continue to work toward a modernized agreement with another round scheduled next month.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"energy\" name=\"energy\"></a>Building greater prosperity by integrating the wealth of energy resources within the hemisphere is an opportunity that is unique in the world to the Americas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past decade, North America has been leading an energy renaissance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy 2040, North America is expected to add more oil production to the global markets than the entire rest of the world combined and more gas production than any other single region. The flow of crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and electricity already crosses our borders in both directions, leading to greater reliability, more efficiency, and lower costs to consumers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur continent has become the energy force for this century, thanks in large part to rapid expansion in natural gas and tight oil production, and, of course, thanks to some great engineers, many produced right here at UT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe rest of the hemisphere can use the North American experience as a model. We see a future where energy connectivity from Canada to Chile can build out and seize upon energy integration throughout the Americas, delivering greater energy security to the hemisphere and stability to growing economies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSouth America is blessed with abundant energy resources. Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina all have significant undeveloped oil and natural gas. The United States is eager to help our partners develop their own resources safely, responsibly, as energy demand continues to grow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcuse me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur hemispheric energy trade is already beginning to meet these needs: 36 percent of U.S. liquefied natural gas exports since 2016 have landed in Latin America. That\u2019s more than any other region in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBetween now and 2030, Latin America is expected to spend at least $70 billion on new electric power generation plants to fuel economic growth. Many of those plants will be powered by natural gas. The United States should be a substantive and reliable supplier.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy building out a more flexible and robust energy system in our hemisphere, we can power our economies with affordable energy. We can lift more people out of poverty. And we can make our hemisphere the undisputed seat of global energy supply. To support and capture this opportunity requires the opening of more market economies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe opening of energy markets in Mexico, for example, has led to greater private investment, more competition, and more energy trade with the United States than ever before. Truly, a win-win.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFurther south, we are partnering with Central America to strengthen its regional electricity market and modernize its grid. Creating stronger Central American economies by lowering energy cost is critical to building a more secure Central America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have the chance to develop an energy partnership that spans the Western Hemisphere, to the benefit of all of our citizens. We cannot afford to squander this moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA transition to more market-based economic reforms are not limited to the energy sector. Argentina, under President Macri\u2019s leadership, has made monumental strides in delivering reforms to open the Argentine economy and pursue growth for all Argentinians. Its historically high inflation rate is finally decreasing. GDP is going up, spurred on by investment and soaring consumer confidence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd one week after the U.S. Congress passed landmark tax reform policy, Argentina\u2019s legislature took action to overhaul their tax system as well. All of these efforts are making the second-largest economy in South America ripe for more investment and growth. We hope more countries take a similar path \u2013 to help the entire hemisphere grow in prosperity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut for prosperity to take root, we must create the conditions for regional stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEconomic development and security reinforce each other. When individuals are living in poverty, a life of crime can look like the only opportunity available to make a living. Legal and illegal immigration increases as people look for more opportunity elsewhere. And innocent people are more likely to become victims of drug cartels, human traffickers, and corrupt law enforcement authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States approach is holistic \u2013 we must address security and development issues side by side. You cannot expect to have one without the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe most immediate threat to our hemisphere are transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs. In their pursuit of money and power, TCOs leave death and destruction in their wake. As humans, weapons, opioids, and other drugs are smuggled, law enforcement and civilians become the targets.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHere at home, Americans do not necessarily see the day-to-day violence that is \u2013 violence that is so common in other parts of our hemisphere. But U.S. demand for drugs drives this violence and this lawlessness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe acknowledge our role as the major market for illicit drug consumption and the need for shared approaches to address these challenges. The opioid epidemic we are facing in this country is a clear, tragic representation of how interconnected our hemisphere truly is. Violence and drugs do not stop at our southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat is why we continue to employ a coordinated, multilateral approach to diminish the influence of these groups. It is time we rid our hemisphere of the violence and devastation that they promote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI co-chair a high-level dialogue with Foreign Secretary Videgaray of Mexico to discuss new and strategic ways to disrupt TCOs. We must take new approaches to disrupt their business models \u2013 models of cartels which operate much like any other business organization that maximizes their value chain from feedstock to manufacturing to distribution to marketing and sales.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second meeting of our dialogue was held in Washington this past December, which included Secretary Nielsen of the Department of Homeland Security and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as our Mexican counterparts. We also had with us law enforcement representatives from both countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDismantling TCOs is not just a diplomatic issue. Obviously, it requires integrating the skills and expertise of law enforcement to interdict shipments of illegal drugs, attack the revenue streams and the weapons feeding TCOs, and to track down and prosecute the middlemen who enable them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tClose collaboration among multiple agencies \u2013 within our own government, and with our international partners \u2013 is essential. The way we combat threats to our southern border security is to work collaboratively with Mexico to strengthen Mexico\u2019s southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThrough the Merida Initiative \u2013 a partnership between the United States and Mexico focused on improving security and the rule of law \u2013 the United States is providing assistance to build the capacity of Mexican law enforcement and judicial institutions. By providing inspection equipment, canine units, and training, we equip law enforcement officers with tools to eradicate opium poppy production, tighten border security, and disrupt trafficking activities \u2013 not just in drugs but in trafficking of humans. By improving cross-border communications, we make both sides of the border safer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd our security partnerships extend beyond just our southern border or Mexico\u2019s southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tColombia has been one of our strongest partners in the region. Following decades of long internal battle with Revolutionary Forces of the FARC, Colombia has charted a pathway to peace. We continue to support this sustainable peace, but challenges do remain. Colombia is the world\u2019s largest producer of cocaine \u2013 the source of 92 percent of the cocaine seized in the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast year, and with U.S. support, Colombian police and military forces eradicated 130,000 acres of coca fields \u2013 the highest number since 2010. The same year, Colombian forces seized nearly 500 metric tons of cocaine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere is more work ahead. Regrettably, coca cultivation has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2016, more than 460,000 acres in Colombia were used for coca cultivation \u2013 a record. We remain a very \u2013 we remain and keep a very open and frank dialogue with the Government of Colombia to address the eradication of this very large feedstock for cocaine and to identify alternative cash crops to support rural Colombian farmers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Central America, through the Alliance for Prosperity, we support countries as they address security and economic development in tandem. Last June in Miami, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, along with our Mexican counterparts, cohosted the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America. Through many productive conversations with public and private sector leaders across the region, opportunities were identified to help Central American countries grow their economies, strengthen their institutions, and better protect their people. More opportunities for Central Americans will weaken the hold of transnational criminal organizations, address the underlying causes of legal and illegal immigration, and result in less violence. That makes their nations stronger, and it makes ours safer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, partners along our third border, the Gulf of Mexico, are increasing their ability to perform maritime interdictions, rein in illegal firearms, counter corruption, and prosecute criminals. Over the summer we submitted our Caribbean 2020 Plans. This comprehensive strategy fosters closer security cooperation and reaffirms our commitment to encourage private sector growth and diversification of energy resources, creating energy security in the Caribbean. We also maintain our partnerships in education and health initiatives, including PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States knows that our country \u2013 and the rest of the region \u2013 benefits from greater regional stability and the prospect of a growing economy throughout the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States\u2019 partnership with nations in the hemisphere is founded on shared values and democratic governance, but we cannot take it for granted. Many still live under the oppression of tyranny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe corrupt and hostile regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela clings to a false dream and antiquated vision for the region that has already failed its citizens. It does not represent the vision of millions of Venezuelans \u2013 or in any way comport with the norms of our Latin American, Canadian, or Caribbean partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur position has not changed. We urge Venezuela to return to its constitution \u2013 to return to free, open, and democratic elections \u2013 and to allow the people of Venezuela a voice in their government. We will continue to pressure the regime to return to the democratic process that made Venezuela a great country in the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela stands in stark contrast to the future of stability pursued by so many others in the hemisphere. The great tragedy is that although Venezuela could be one of the most prosperous countries in the region, it is one of the poorest in the world. Venezuela GDP growth in 2004 was as high as 18 percent. Ten years later, it is nearly a negative 4 percent \u2013 all the result of man-made collapse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela boasts the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, but riches are reserved only for the ruling elites. As a consequence, the people suffer. Venezuelans are starving, looting is common, and the sick do not receive the medical attention they desperately need. Venezuelans are dying of malnutrition and disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere has been no natural disaster \u2013 nothing like that earthquake that took me to Peru. The Venezuelan people suffer because of a corrupt regime that steals from its own people. The Maduro regime is squarely to blame and must be held to account.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States has imposed sanctions on more than 40 current or former Venezuelan government officials \u2013 individuals who support Maduro and his efforts to undermine democracy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past year, we have worked with many of our Latin American partners \u2013 through the Lima Group and the Organization of American States in particular \u2013 to build support for coordinated action to counter the country\u2019s slide into dictatorship. We appreciate the Lima Group of major regional leaders who have met regularly to support the Venezuelan people\u2019s quest to regain their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCanada too has sanctioned dozens of Venezuelan leaders, including Maduro himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd recently, the European Union joined the growing global chorus to sanction leaders in the regime for human rights abuses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe world is waking to the plight of the Venezuelan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe encourage all nations to support the Venezuelan people. The time has come to stand with freedom-loving nations, those that support the Venezuelan people, or choose to stand with the Maduro dictatorship, if that is your choice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tElsewhere we will continue to encourage others in the region, like Cuba, who disregard their people and ignore this democratic moment in Latin America, to give their people the freedom that they deserve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCuba has an opportunity in their own transfer of power from decades of the Castro regime to take a new direction. In June, President Trump laid out a new vision for our approach to Cuba \u2013 one that supports the Cuban people by steering economic activity away from the military, intelligence, and security service which disregard their freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe administration\u2019s policy \u2013 as written in the National Security Presidential Memorandum \u2013 also seeks to, quote, \u201censure that the engagement between the United States and Cuba advances the interests of the United States and that of the Cuban people.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt includes advancing human rights and encouraging the nascent private sector in Cuba. The future of our relationship is up to Cuba \u2013 the United States will continue to support the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela and Cuba remind us that for our hemisphere to grow and thrive, we must prioritize and promote democratic values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe must root out corruption in all of its forms. Ineffective, corrupt governance damages countries. The economy suffers. People lose faith in institutions. And crime increases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRecent steps taken against corruption in Guatemala, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil underscore the importance of directly addressing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Guatemala, we continue to support the CICIG \u2013 a UN body created in 2006 \u2013 to uphold the rule of law, strengthen accountability, and independently investigate illegal, corrupt activity affecting government institutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t2018 should be the year countries in the Western Hemisphere restore their trust with their people, the people they represent, and take serious anti-corruption action.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEarlier as I mentioned the Summit of the Americas, hosted by Peru \u2013 will be hosted by Peru in April. We wholeheartedly support this year\u2019s theme: \u201cDemocratic Governance Against Corruption.\u201d And we encourage every nation in the region to fully embrace it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEncouraging transparency, increasing accountability, rooting out corruption \u2013 all of these are essential to creating a sound economy for the region, promoting security, and protecting our values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrong institutions and governments that are accountable to their people also secure their sovereignty against potential predatory actors that are now showing up in our hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina \u2013 as it does in emerging markets throughout the world \u2013 offers the appearance of an attractive path to development. But in reality, this often involves trading short-term gains for long-term dependency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust think about the difference between the China model of economic development and the United States version.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina\u2019s offer always come at a price \u2013 usually in the form of state-led investments, carried out by imported Chinese labor, onerous loans, and unsustainable debt. The China model extracts precious resources to feed its own economy, often with disregard for the laws of the land or human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, China is gaining a foothold in Latin America. It is using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit. The question is: At what price?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina is now the largest trading partner of Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. While this trade has brought benefits, the unfair trading practices used by many Chinese have also harmed these countries\u2019 manufacturing sectors, generating unemployment and lowering wages for workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLatin American \u2013 Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people. China\u2019s state-led model of development is reminiscent of the past. It doesn\u2019t have to be this hemisphere\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRussia\u2019s growing presence in the region is alarming as well, as it continues to sell arms and military equipment to unfriendly regimes who do not share or respect democratic values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur region must be diligent to guard against faraway powers who do not reflect the fundamental values shared in this region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands in vivid contrast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe do not seek short-term deals with lopsided returns. We seek partners with shared values and visions to create a safe, secure, and prosperous hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. approach is based on mutually beneficial goals to help both sides grow, develop and become more prosperous, and do so by respecting international law, prioritizing the interests of our partners, and protecting our values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith the United States, you have a multidimensional partner \u2013 one that benefits both sides with engagement to support economic growth, education, innovation, and security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year the United States is eager to create even deeper relationships with Latin America and Caribbean partners, with the aim of expanding freedom to more people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have a tremendous opportunity to build upon our shared history, culture, and values to generate more opportunity, more stability, more prosperity, and more resilient governance in South America, Central America, North America, and the Caribbean.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this year of the Americas, the United States will continue to be the Western Hemisphere\u2019s steadiest, strongest, and most enduring partner. Thank you for your kind attention.

I\u2019m the executive director of the Clements Center and a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, a couple of your hosts for today. And honored to have so many of our students here in the audience, and we\u2019re going to be hearing from a few of those students in a little bit.\n\n\n<p>\n\tMr. Secretary, as you and I were visiting out back beforehand, we were remembering the first time we met was a couple years ago, and at that time, you were in the private sector and I had given a foreign policy speech to a group of UT alums, of whom you were in the audience. And as we recalled, you asked me some very probing questions in that \u2013 after my lecture, and I don\u2019t --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> (Laughter.) What goes around comes around, I guess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> That\u2019s right. I \u2013 the tables have turned, sir. I don\u2019t think either of us expected two years later we\u2019d be here on the one-year anniversary of being Secretary, so, anyway, so my turn to ask some questions. I\u2019m going to ask the Secretary a few questions, we\u2019ll have a colloquy here, and then we\u2019re going to hear from a few of our students as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, Mr. Secretary, I\u2019m a historian by training, and whenever I\u2019m looking at current foreign policy issues, I always like to think about the historical context. And as our history students here will know, in a few years, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, which, for a very young United States, was our assertion of \u2013 our efforts to keep European colonial powers out of the Western Hemisphere to protect our security but also to promote the three pillars of the speech you talked about today: security, liberty, and prosperity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, you as Secretary, you kind of inherit that 200-year tradition. Looking back, how would you regard the Monroe Doctrine? Has it been more of a success or a failure, especially as you look at our challenges today?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think it clearly has been a success, because as I mentioned at the top, what binds us together in this hemisphere are shared democratic values, and while different countries may express that democracy not precisely the same way we practice democracy in this country, the fundamentals of it \u2013 respect for the dignity of the human being, respect for the individual to pursue life, liberty, happiness \u2013 those elements do bind us together in this hemisphere. So I think it clearly was an important commitment at the time, and I think over the years, that has continued to frame the relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, it\u2019s easy for the United States as a country, because of our size and our engagements with so many countries and regions around the world, to, through nothing more than just perhaps a period of neglect, to let certain relationships atrophy a bit. And we\u2019ve gone \u2013 I think we\u2019ve gone through those periods of time in our history as well, and if you look back and whether \u2013 you can go by individual country or regionally as well, due to other events, sometimes I think we have forgotten about the importance of the Monroe Doctrine and what it meant to this hemisphere and maintaining those shared values. So I think it\u2019s as relevant today as it was the day it was written.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Okay, cool. John Quincy Adams would be happy to hear that, so. (Laughter.) You mentioned in your speech NAFTA and the ongoing renegotiations and efforts to bring it up to speed, and it was on the presidential campaign trail in 1980 that candidate Ronald Reagan was the first American political leader to call for a North American free trade accord, which soon thereafter became NAFTA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as you mentioned, we\u2019ve been living with this vision and this reality for quite a while. As we\u2019re \u2013 as our country is in the midst of the NAFTA renegotiations, what would you describe as the \u2013 what have been the strengths and the weaknesses of NAFTA as currently constituted?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think \u2013 again, and as I mentioned, when it was put in place 30 years ago, the world was a bit of a different place. Supply chains didn\u2019t function the way they do today \u2013 again, I mention the advent of the digital age, the digital economy, which has completely disrupted supply chains and how they function. The rise of China now as the second largest economy in the world, and China growing its economy by spreading out its own trading relationships \u2013 all of those have had an impact on NAFTA\u2019s ability to respond \u2013 the agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that\u2019s why I think \u2013 we think about it as a need to modernize the agreement. I think the strength of building upon the fact that with shared borders, there are clear efficiencies to be gained that serve all three countries well and creates more value, and that\u2019s \u2013 in the global world of competition and trade, and whether you\u2019re building automobiles or whatever you\u2019re manufacturing or whatever you\u2019re doing agriculturally, you are competing with others. And when we can integrate the strengths of these three countries that share this border \u2013 if we can lower our cost of supply by that much, we just won, we just beat the other trading partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think \u2013 and that was always the vision in the beginning, and I think where it\u2019s \u2013 where it\u2019s having trouble and struggling today is because it\u2019s not been able to respond to that outside competitive force as effectively as perhaps it should. So we\u2019re hoping we can get to a modernized agreement. I\u2019m not directly engaged in those negotiations; I stay close to them because they do intersect with our foreign policy agenda as well. I can tell you it\u2019s \u2013 these are tough negotiations, and I\u2019m sure some of you are hearing about that, but the parties are continuing to work, I think, towards a solution that serves all three countries\u2019 interests well, but then collectively achieves the subjective of collectively making us the most competitive trading entity in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>So I want to come back to another country that you mentioned towards the end of your \u2013 end of your speech, and that\u2019s Cuba, one of the two remaining tyrannies in the region along with Venezuela. President Trump has been quite critical of the Obama administration\u2019s previous normalization process with Cuba, with the Castro regime. But as you mentioned in June when the President announced some new regulations \u2013 or a few months ago, in November when he announced some new regulations, some Cuban American groups worried that those didn\u2019t go far enough in reversing the previous administration\u2019s policies. So what would you say are your strategic priorities towards Cuba going forward?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as I mentioned, they\u2019re \u2013 they will be going through a transfer of power \u2013 supposed to this year, we\u2019ll see whether it happens this year or not, but \u2013 and this will be, in all likelihood, the first transfer of power that Cuba has not been led under a Castro regime, so that we think there are opportunities, perhaps, for \u2013 an opportunity to shift towards a more open and democratic future. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to our objectives with Cuba, and the \u2013 I think President Trump\u2019s analysis \u2013 and I agree with it \u2013 of the terms with Cuba that were in place when we took office, that an awful lot had been given to the Cuban Government, and not much had been received in return, other than a clear economic opportunity for U.S. business interests, which is great.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut that was coming on the backs of the Cuban people, who are still very repressed. So we have taken a shift, we preserved a lot of that, but basically said, \u201cYes, we do want to support the Cuban people.\u201d We\u2019re not interested in supporting the Cuban regime. And as you know, the government and the security forces and others have a significant presence in almost all economic activity. So one of our objectives was to separate that and allow the Cuban people to have a more full, rewarding participation in that economy, and limit what we\u2019re \u2013 what the government is benefiting from through their ownership.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that was one of the significant changes, but again, it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s all directed at how do we help the Cuban people. That\u2019s what we want to do is help the Cuban people, and we are hopeful, and we stay \u2013 we do stay engaged with the Cuban authorities that \u2013 in this transition, can they find their way to maybe a different future? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>Yeah, we\u2019ll see. Great. Well, as a professor, I could go on all day with more and more of my questions, this and that, but I think we\u2019ll all be a little more interested to hear from some of our students. So we\u2019ve got a number of students with questions for you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>And we\u2019ve got microphones that are coming down the alleys, and all the rest of you, if you\u2019re not a student, sorry, no questions from you. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right, let\u2019s see. First one up, we\u2019ve got Patricia Zavala, so \u2013 Patricia, where are you? So \u2013 that\u2019s right, there you go. Galen, the mike to Patricia, so \u2013 and please identify your degree program and school, that\u2019s right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello, Secretary Tillerson. My name is Patricia Zavala. I\u2019m a dual-degree master\u2019s student at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, and the Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies. And my question is about corruption in Latin America, which is something that you touched on in your speech. Given the effect that corruption has in undermining public institutions and impeding the effective implementation of the administration\u2019s policy priorities, what can the U.S. do to combat the endemic corruption in the region?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, now I mentioned a number \u2013 we have a number of initiatives and funding programs working directly with individual countries \u2013 the U.S. directly but also using other UN and other international organizations to, first and foremost, strengthen the judicial systems. If we can get judicial systems and judges that are not corruptible, then you can begin to prosecute cases of corruption and punish people, and then that begins to dissuade them. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s the approach. Now, that does then raise significant risk for those judges, so hand in glove with it goes strengthening law enforcement and security in the region and in those countries to protect those who are taking action to eradicate corruption. And there is \u2013 without question, there\u2019s an intersection of a lot of the trans-criminal organizations with the corruption as well to facilitate their narcotics activities, their human trafficking activities, other kind of illicit smuggling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is quite \u2013 it\u2019s quite challenging, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in Central America with these initiatives using \u2013 and in Mexico with the Merida Initiative that I mentioned \u2013 those are all specifically targeted at exactly the issue that you\u2019re asking about, but it is strengthening judicial systems, getting judges in place that will act in accordance with their law, in some cases passing new prosecutorial laws that make it easier to prosecute corruption. A lot of these are evidentiary laws. If you don\u2019t have good evidentiary laws, you can\u2019t make the case for a prosecution \u2013 and then creating an environment where these judges can do their job, recognizing that some of them are going to come under threat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s very targeted, and we try to go country by country as to what is best needed there. But both in Mexico and in Latin America, it\u2019s a significant undertaking. That really is what\u2019s necessary to create the kind of environment then to allow economic prosperity, growth, job creation. That\u2019s what keeps everybody at home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right, thanks. All right, our next question from Juan Gonzalez-Rivera.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello, Mr. Secretary of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Hello, Juan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> My question is \u2013 first, I\u2019m a Fulbright student from Colombia. I\u2019m a candidate for PhD in chemical engineering, so my question is about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Future ExxonMobil. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> My question is about your science --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Or future State Department. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> About your science diplomacy agenda. So in your upcoming travel to Latin America, will there be a science strategic agenda to foster scientific cooperation in topics of interest to the region, or other topics of interest to the region such as food security, infectious diseases, and, of course, the environment?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think, as you point \u2013 you just touched on areas that are obvious for cooperation and scientific investigation, and certainly the \u2013 South America in particular has some incredibly rich ecology areas, things that we can learn a lot about what\u2019s happening with the environment, what\u2019s happening with the planet, what is the effect of climate change that we\u2019re seeing. And so yes, there are important joint scientific efforts for us to fund, send our own scientists there, but also bring scientists from Latin and South America to our institutions in the United States \u2013 and like yourself \u2013 to study and share, grow, and either go back home to continue that work or stay here. So it\u2019s \u2013 there are environmental issues of interest, there are diseases that are of particular interest in certain environments in particular, and that\u2019s why we have a very active PEPFAR program. As you know, it\u2019s AIDS, but it\u2019s also malaria and a few other infectious diseases that are important.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is an opportunity for us to talk about how are those collaborations that are in place going, what could we do to either strengthen those or expand them, and what new areas of investigation might be of interest to both of us. Certainly, the strong educational ties between our two countries and the fact that you\u2019re here studying at the University of Texas \u2013 and congratulations on being a Fulbright scholar \u2013 those are the strong connections that down the road \u2013 and these are the people-to-people connections \u2013 that are going to keep our countries very, very close together in terms of our values as well. And all the best to you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. Okay, another student question. We\u2019ve got Sean Salome there. The microphone\u2019s coming down. And Mr. Secretary, Sean, who\u2019s about to ask you the question, he\u2019s one of our Clements Center undergraduates. He\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s studying, but he\u2019s also a Marine vet who did a couple of deployments in Colombia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>God bless you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Good afternoon, Secretary. Thank you for having us. Colombia\u2019s facing a crossroads right now. Its neighbor to the east, Venezuela, is deteriorating as its continued government is strangulating the people. We\u2019re having mass migration of Venezuelans enter Colombia. Internally, Colombia\u2019s government and the ELN have failed peace talks, and these issues may very well lead to social unrest and economic turmoil for Colombians. How does this U.S. plan \u2013 or U.S. aid plan on aiding the Colombian people, and should the FARC be part of this process? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as you know, they have a very prescribed process to work through the implementation of the peace accord, and I would share your observation that it has stalled a bit. They were making good progress and now some areas that are important seem to have hit a pause. That\u2019s one of the areas we will be talking with the Santos government about: How can we get those restarted, continue the \u2013 we think it\u2019s important to continue to implement the peace accord if we\u2019re going to secure the peace that has been negotiated with the FARC, FLN<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou are correct in terms of Colombia is probably the most impacted country from the Venezuelan crisis. Something between 200- and 300,000 Venezuelans have now left Venezuela, living in Colombia as refugees, basically, but another couple of hundred thousand that are going back and forth all the time, just seeking food and medical treatment in particular. We have attempted to provide certain medical equipment \u2013 vaccines and others \u2013 to the Venezuelan Government so these people don\u2019t have to leave to get their treatments. The Venezuelan Government refuses to take that aid. Maduro does not want to appear that he needs it. We\u2019re going to continue to work at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is a \u2013 it\u2019s a real problem for Colombia and it has the potential to destabilize Colombia, which is why continuing to move forward on the peace implementation is so important, so it doesn\u2019t create a new area of instability and all the parties go back to their corners and we\u2019re right where we were.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have a lot of confidence in the Santos government, and we know they have elections coming up, but we believe the government is very committed to following through on implementing the peace accord. We need to encourage them and help where we can in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe problem with the coca production is \u2013 it\u2019s a significant problem. It\u2019s a problem to us, it\u2019s a shared problem. As I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t like to admit it, but we\u2019re the market. The United States accounts for the vast, vast, vast majority of illicit drug consumption in the world. And until we address that problem at home, it\u2019s a bit awkward to hold them solely accountable for being the supplier. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re working through these integrated dialogues to put the whole supply chain together. Let\u2019s own the consumption problem. We have to own that. They need to own the supply side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in Colombia we\u2019ve got a lot of issues to deal with, but we also think Colombia is an enormous country of opportunity, and they have everything they need to be wildly successful, and we believe they can be and they will be, and we just need to support them and encourage them to get on with implementing the peace accords.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for the question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. And then next question is from Alyson (ph), Alyson (inaudible). Yeah. The mike is going to you. Remember, please identify your degree program. Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Secretary Tillerson. Thanks so much for taking our questions. My name is Alyson Swadic (ph). I\u2019m a second-year master of public affairs student at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. My question is about the Merida Initiative, the security partnership between the U.S. and Mexico that you alluded to in your speech. You mentioned the importance of rule of law and fighting organized crime. Congress appropriated $2.8 billion to the Merida Initiative in 2008, but there\u2019s $1 billion left to spend. How do you think the U.S. should best spend that money in order to promote security for both nations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, in order to spend the money we also need the cooperation with the Mexican Government of where \u2013 where do they agree we can help them the most. So oftentimes the pace of that is coming to agreement with them on where they are willing, and we can work with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe continue to believe that we can provide them significant training in law enforcement because they need \u2013 they need more law enforcement personnel, training of people to build their forces up, and new kinds of training to deal with the cartels in particular. Regrettably, the cartels are \u2013 have become more powerful. They are extremely well armed. Most of those arms are coming from the United States. So we have a huge weapons interdiction effort underway as well. This is why we have Department of Homeland Security involved. Interestingly, for about every 10 trucks that we inspect coming north, because we\u2019re worried about what\u2019s coming to see us, we only inspect one truck going south. And so we have committed to them that we will do a better job of interdicting weapons flowing in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\u2019s \u2013 it is through this joint dialogue we\u2019re having with them to identify looking at what is \u2013 what are all elements of this supply chain? Where can we best attack that? What are the capabilities we need? And then we have some funds to address that. So it is going to be, I think, law enforcement, some ability to \u2013 for them to collect intelligence themselves on where these labs are. We destroyed, I think, about 134 labs last year through some information sharing, and when we identify them, the Mexican forces have been going in to destroy those. So I think we have a \u2013 or we\u2019ve got, unfortunately, too many opportunities where we can apply the joint effort, and we have the resources, the money, to do that. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Thanks. All right. All right. Another student question. Yeah, Evan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secretary Tillerson, thank you very much. My name is Evan McCormick. I\u2019m a post-doctoral fellow at the Clements Center. During the political crisis in Venezuela last year, the State Department vocally backed the Organization for American States\u2019 criticisms of the Venezuelan electoral system. In December, however, the State Department recognized the re-election of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez in spite similar \u2013 in spite of similar criticisms from the OAS regarding electoral irregularities and calling for or recommending a new election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy question is: What is the Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding support for free and fair democratic elections in the Americas, and will it work with the OAS in ensuring that those democratic standards are respected equally across the hemisphere?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, our position\u2019s the same in every country. And in the case of the Honduran elections, we also looked at other organizations\u2019 assessment of the election in terms of was it conducted in a free and fair way, was the election legitimate. In terms of why the OAS came to a different conclusion \u2013 which was actually different than the original conclusion they came to, they changed their position \u2013 I\u2019d refer you to the OAS to ask them. But we did look at the circumstances of the election. We concluded it was conducted fairly. And I think there\u2019s no \u2013 and I want to be clear here. There can be no comparison between the election process that was conducted in Honduras and the election process that\u2019s going on in Venezuela. They\u2019re nowhere close to one another. Thank you for the question, though.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right, okay. And one more student question. Let\u2019s do Abigail (ph). Right there, Diana (ph). Yeah, thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for spending part of your day with us. My name is Abigail Griffin and I am senior studying Plan II Honors government and Middle Eastern languages and cultures. I have a question regarding Venezuela. So a commonly proposed solution to a lot of the problems in the country is the removal of President Maduro from power. In your opinion, is this removal necessary, and what could the U.S.\u2019s role be in the possible regime change, especially considering the turmoil that could surmount from such a change?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, President Maduro could choose to just leave. I mean, that would \u2013 (laughter). That\u2019d be the easiest. We have not advocated for regime change or removal of President Maduro; rather, we have advocated that they return to the constitution. We do not recognize the constituent assembly as legitimate, and they need to get back to the constitution and follow the constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe \u2013 I think there will be a change. We want it to be a peaceful change. Peaceful transitions, peaceful regime change is always better than the alternative of violent change. In the history of Venezuela and in fact the history in other Latin American and South American countries, oftentimes it\u2019s the military that handles that, that when things are so bad that the military leadership realizes they just \u2013 they can\u2019t serve the citizens anymore, they will manage a peaceful transition. Whether that will be the case here or not, I do not know. Again, our position is Maduro should get back to his constitution and follow it. And then, if he is not re-elected by the people, so be it. And if the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s got some friends over in Cuba that can give him a nice hacienda on the beach, and he can have a nice life over there. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. Well, our time is drawing to the close. I know the Secretary needs to head off on the next leg of his very ambitious journey here. But Mr. Secretary, one final question from the moderator here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a native Texan, you know here that here in Texas we have very strong concerns about border security, and I can \u2013 I think I can speak for almost everyone here in the room that when we look at our state\u2019s borders, especially SUT folks, our biggest concern is the threat from Oklahoma. (Laughter.) So especially the Sooners football team. So you\u2019ve got a captive audience. What advice do you have for Coach Herman, and what are we going to do to beat OU this fall? (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think I can help him. (Laughter.) We just need to get in place a visa program for the Red River \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and we just won\u2019t issue any visas to the Oklahoma football team. (Laughter and applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> I\u2019m really not worried. I\u2019m really not worried because University of Texas is going to beat Oklahoma this year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> There\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s headline. All right, okay. (Applause.) All right, okay. All right, all right. Everybody please join me in welcoming and thanking Secretary Tillerson. Thank you so much, sir. That was awesome. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd everybody, before you leave, we\u2019ve got a little sendoff for you from the Secretary\u2019s \u2013 the Secretary\u2019s old bandmates, his old friends. So stay with us for a couple minutes. Can\u2019t leave without a song. So that\u2019s right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(A song is performed.)

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s background call to preview the Secretary\u2019s upcoming trip to Texas, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and also Jamaica. Today we\u2019re joined by [Senior State Department Official One], who will be referred to as Senior State Department Official One. We\u2019re also joined by [Senior State Department Official Two], who will be referred to as Senior State Department Official Two. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is on background; it\u2019ll be embargoed until the end of the call. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And with that, I will turn it over to our senior State Department officials for opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take a few questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Thanks, [Moderator], very much. The Secretary is planning to leave on February 1st, and he will actually depart for Austin, Texas from the Greenbrier, which is in West Virginia, where he\u2019ll be giving a speech that morning. He will then speak to a group at the University of Texas of approximately 250 people, and he\u2019ll be greeted and hosted by the university president, Gregory Fenves. It\u2019s the Secretary\u2019s alma mater, so he\u2019s looking forward to returning. That speech should last about an hour. It\u2019ll be in the early afternoon. It\u2019ll be open. It\u2019ll be streamed on Facebook and all other vehicles. And there will be a Q&amp;A after the speech, and that Q&amp;A will be open to other questions, and so there might be questions relating to Latin America, which is what the speech will be about, but then there will \u2013 could also be questions relating to other countries in the world, and he\u2019ll be happy to answer those too.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>He\u2019ll then leave mid-afternoon and will go to Mexico City. And that evening, he\u2019s meeting with Mexican Government leaders at the ambassador\u2019s residence. And he\u2019ll stay overnight in \u2013 will stay overnight in Mexico City. And that morning, they\u2019ll \u2013 he\u2019ll meet with chiefs of missions. This is where the Secretary of State brings together chiefs of missions from certain countries and is able to talk to them in an informal setting about how things are going within their nation and listen to any concerns they have or anything they need from the Secretary. So at this particular chief of mission conference will be chiefs of missions from Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Belize, and the Caribbean. That\u2019s in the morning. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then later that day, late morning, he meets with the \u2013 Videgaray, the foreign minister. And then there\u2019ll be a joint press avail after that sometime before noon. And then some time in the early afternoon, he\u2019s going to meet with President Pena Nieto. And around mid-afternoon, probably around 3 o\u2019clock or so, he\u2019ll probably go to the Zocalo, or the Metropolitan Cathedral, although that is not definite.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then later that day, will fly to Panama City, so just \u2013 where there\u2019ll be refueling, and then he\u2019ll immediately go on to Bariloche in Argentina, arriving on Saturday morning. That day will then start around noon, where he\u2019ll go to \u2013 is expected to go to the Nahuel Huapi National Park. And right now, he\u2019s expected to ascend the summit on horseback, but there will also be a chairlift for those people that \u2013 reporters and others that want to go on the chairlift and film him coming up on the horseback, or who don\u2019t want to go on horseback. It will be your choice. And that takes care of that afternoon.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Sunday, it\u2019s Bariloche to Buenos Aires. So he\u2019ll arrive at Buenos Aires sometime closer to around noon. There\u2019ll be a wreath-laying at Saint Martin Plaza \u2013 at Saint Martin Palace, I\u2019m sorry, with the foreign minister. Then a meeting with the foreign minister and key cabinet ministers. There\u2019ll be a joint press avail sometime around 2:00, and then he\u2019ll meet that afternoon with chiefs of missions from that part of the world, and that would include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia. He is planning to meet the Panama ambassador when he \u2013 when the plane lands in Panama City.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The \u2013 there\u2019ll be a mission personnel meeting that afternoon, and then that evening is the Super Bowl, which he, along with many other people, will be watching. The next day he\u2019ll meet with President Macri in the morning. And then late morning, he\u2019ll leave Buenos Aires for Lima, when he \u2013 arriving in Lima around 2:00, where he\u2019ll meet with the foreign minister, Aljovin. There\u2019ll be a press avail for that. There\u2019ll be a meeting with the ambassador, the American ambassador to Peru, and that will take care of that evening. That \u2013 all that should take until around 6 o\u2019clock or so.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Tuesday he meets with the president of Peru, President Kuczynski, and will leave late morning to Bogota, where that afternoon he\u2019ll meet with the ambassador and then sometime around 4:00 meet with the president of Colombia, President Santos. There\u2019ll be a joint press avail, and then later after that he\u2019ll meet with the foreign minister, Holguin. That evening there\u2019s an informal working dinner with President Santos.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Wednesday morning he flies to Kingston, Jamaica. He\u2019ll meet with the prime minister, Holness, and Foreign Minister Johnson-Smith. And there\u2019ll be an expanded meeting after that, so basically a 20-minute meeting first and then another meeting. And then later that day he\u2019ll meet with the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the embassy, and will then fly back to Washington, landing somewhere around 7 to 8 o\u2019clock.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And I\u2019d like to introduce [Senior State Department Official Two], who can give you some more color relating to the purpose of the trip and why we\u2019ve chosen those particular countries.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. Secretary Tillerson\u2019s going to be making \u2013 embarking on his first multi-country trip to Latin America and the Caribbean this week. It\u2019s appropriate, as there are some very important events occurring in this hemisphere where U.S. leadership will be on display. There\u2019s the Summit of the Americas in Peru in April; in June, the G7 summit will take place in Canada; and later in the year, at the end of November, Argentina will host the G20 summit for the first time in South America. U.S. leadership will be on display as we work with our Latin American partners throughout the region.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary is engaging with regional partners on this trip to promote a safe, prosperous, energy-secure, and democratic hemisphere. We stand with the region as a steady, enduring partner. We\u2019re working hand in hand with partners to disrupt the transnational criminal organizations and trafficking routes that harm our hemisphere\u2019s citizens and drive illegal migration. The United States trades twice as much with this hemisphere as we do with China, and we will continue to enhance our trade and energy relationships to foster prosperity for our region. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We remain steadfast in our shared respect for democracy and human rights. The Secretary will continue to advocate for increased regional attention to the multiple crises in Venezuela. With our partners, we plan to continue to pressure the corrupt Maduro regime to return to democratic order.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With that, I\u2019ll stop and take questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> For our first question we\u2019ll go to <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> and the line of Tracy Wilkinson. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. How are you? Thank you for doing this. Gosh, I have a gazillion questions. Let\u2019s start with \u2013 [Senior State Department Official One], did you say that the Secretary will be meeting with Venezuelan officials in that meeting in Buenos Aires, or did I hear wrong?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> I \u2013 well, not officials, the \u2013 he\u2019s definitely not meeting with Venezuelan officials.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> I think he was talking about there will be a chief of mission conference --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I see. Okay. So a U.S. official from \u2013 who is stationed in --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Yeah, and our charg\u00e9 will --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Right. So when I mentioned --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Got it.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> -- all those countries, those are American charg\u00e9s -- charg\u00e9</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, that was my confusion. Okay, got it. Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>All right, so on \u2013 let\u2019s start with Colombia. There has been a lot of concern and talk on the \u2013 in Congress about the surge in coca production. Is this something you\u2019re going to be \u2013 or the Secretary will be raising with President Santos, and do you \u2013 is the position of this government, this administration, of you guys that the peace process has facilitated coca production, which is what some people claim?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then on Mexico, I know there\u2019s a lot of concern that the NAFTA talks could spoil other cooperation between Mexico and the United States in terms of immigration and drug trafficking and all of those things. So what will the Secretary\u2019s message be to Mexico vis-a-vis those talks? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> On Colombia, the Secretary absolutely is going to discuss the surge in coca production and cocaine production, but he\u2019s also going to note how we continue to work in close collaboration with the Colombian Government and its security forces to combat this problem of drug trafficking as it affects Colombia, as it affects the entire hemisphere, and the threat it poses to the United States. So we will most certainly raise that in Colombia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With regard to the question of NAFTA in Mexico, the Secretary\u2019s visit will once again underscore that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is deep and broad. He will talk about our joint efforts against transnational criminal organizations. He will underscore how our two governments are cooperating to prevent illegal migration from reaching our southwest border and how we\u2019re working together to address the underlying conditions that are prompting illegal migration from Central America through our joint efforts in Central America and in the Northern Triangle countries.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Next question, Nora Gamez from the <i>Miami Herald</i>.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Your line is now open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, hi, hello. Thank you for doing this. Senator Marco Rubio has sent a letter to the President asking to impose sanctions against Diosdado Cabello, and I wonder if State Department support that position, like imposing sanctions against Cabello.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And a quick question on Cuba: Will the Secretary Tillerson be addressing the situation in Cuba on his trip?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> The State Department, in line with the White House, will use all economic, political, and diplomatic tools at our disposal to address the situation in Venezuela. The upcoming undemocratic transition of political authority in Cuba is likely to be raised at multiple stops throughout the Secretary\u2019s trip.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Next question, please. Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit more about the intent of the Secretary\u2019s visit to Bariloche? What \u2013 aside from the visit to the national park, what message is he trying to send by visiting Bariloche and what does he hope to achieve there?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Well, very importantly, he\u2019s going to be meeting there with people who run the national park but also a Fulbright scholar. He\u2019s going to be talking about the kinds of scientific and research exchanges that are going on between the two countries. And at the national park, he will underscore how conservation at the park is advancing important goals as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Rafael Bernal from The Hill.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thank you for having this. With the chiefs of mission talk in Mexico City, you mentioned El Salvador and Honduras are going to be there. I wanted to know if the Secretary will address questions related to TPS. And on that question, I know Senator Cardin is holding up the OAS ambassador subject to the State Department releasing the documents that went from the embassy to State and then to DHS. Do you plan to release those to the Senate? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Yeah. We\u2019re aware of the senator\u2019s request. I will have to get with our Legislative Affairs bureau to get a fuller answer to that question. But Temporary Protective Status is a Department of Homeland Security decision ultimately. There\u2019s no doubt that in our meeting with our ambassadors from that group, we will internally discuss the challenges and the opportunities that the TPS decision presents to our partners in the hemisphere.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> All right, thank you. Luis Alonso from AP. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Good morning for doing this. I would like to ask \u2013 well, it\u2019s a two-part question. First, the \u2013 it\u2019s the first multi-country trip to Latin America by the Secretary after he\u2019s been a full year in the job. Is \u2013 how the region should be reading the fact that it took him a year to visit several countries in the region?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And the second part of the question is specifically about Venezuela. There are some reports in the Spanish-language press saying that Secretary Tillerson may use this trip to the region to sound out regional leaders on a possible U.S. oil embargo against Venezuela. And also, now that I\u2019m at this, is the U.S. \u2013 does the U.S. have a preference on whether Peru, as the host of the summit, should invite or should not invite Venezuela to the summit? Thank you very much.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the Secretary\u2019s priority and attention towards \u2013 towards the Western Hemisphere began with his first bilateral trip abroad, which was to Mexico. And I think this trip builds on his engagement in the Western Hemisphere throughout the past year, and the meetings he\u2019s had here in Washington with different leaders demonstrates that he has been engaged, and this trip will allow him to deepen and broaden those relationships. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Regarding the Summit of the Americas, we look forward to participating in that summit. The summit\u2019s theme of democratic governance in anti-corruption efforts will allow us to underscore and highlight the corrupt practices that are occurring in Venezuela under the Maduro regime. President Maduro, if invited and if he attends, will have to answer to the rest of the democratic nations of this hemisphere while he has pursued \u2013 why he has pursued illegitimate elections over the last year, and we would look forward to that discussion.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Last question, is that what you\u2019re saying, or another one? Okay. Maria Molina with Radio Colombia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi. I wanted to ask you if there is a further strategy from the U.S. apart from the sanctions to Venezuela, because right now, apparently, they are not seeming to be really, really effective. So I wanted to ask if there \u2013 if you were thinking about a further strategy not related to sanctions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> Our strategy on Venezuela has been extremely effective. Over the last year, we sanctioned more than 50 individuals. The Lima Group has joined this effort and created an additional hemispheric pressure entity on Caracas. The Canadian Government has also sanctioned individuals in Venezuela, and just last week, the European Union joined the international pressure campaign to hold individuals who are violating human rights in Venezuela, who are responsible for antidemocratic practices and who are robbing the national treasury of the country, by imposing their own international sanctions. The pressure campaign is working. The financial sanctions we have placed on the Venezuelan Government has forced it to begin becoming in default, both on sovereign and PDVSA, its oil company\u2019s, debt. And what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the Maduro regime is a total economic collapse in Venezuela. So our policy is working, our strategy is working and we\u2019re going to keep it on the Venezuelans. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> And our final question, Christina Garcia from EFC.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thank you for having this call. I just want to confirm that the \u2013 Secretary Tillerson is going to the Summit of the Americas, and also, is President Trump also going? Thank you so much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> The Summit of the Americas invitations are due out in the next couple of weeks, and we will make decisions on the \u2013 the U.S. Government participation at that time. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. And any final comments that anyone want to wrap up with here? [Senior State Department Official One]? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIORE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> No, I think it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing you on the trip.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> And I just \u2013 I just also want to underscore in talking about our sanctions. They are targeted at the responsible \u2013 members of the regime in Venezuela. And it\u2019s really important that our financial sectors are targeted at the placement of additional debt by the Venezuelan Government. Not a single corn \u2013 ear of corn \u2013 not a single medicine container, not anything that could help the Venezuelan people is blocked by our sanctions. Our goal is to help the Venezuelan people deal with this economic crisis, but also restore democratic order so that they can be in charge of their future again. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you so much, sir. Thanks, everybody. The embargo will now be lifted, and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> So you may need something on the record, so I\u2019ll just \u2013 I want to give you something on the record regarding Venezuela, I\u2019ll give you an update on something we are announcing for next week regarding Qatar, and then give you a little bit on the Secretary\u2019s travel in Europe today, and then take some of your questions. And I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to have to keep today short because we have to go over to the Foreign Press Center.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Okay. On Venezuela, you may have seen yesterday that I issued a statement on Venezuela, and I want to reiterate that the United States strongly rejects the call by Venezuela\u2019s illegitimate Constituent Assembly for snap presidential elections before April 30th. The vote would neither be free nor fair; it would only deepen, not help resolve national tensions. It would not reflect the will of the Venezuelan people and would not be seen as \u2013 and would be seen as undemocratic and illegitimate in the eyes of the international community.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We call on the Maduro regime to respect the human rights of all of its citizens and to return to democratic constitutional order. A free, fair, transparent electoral process open to credible international observation is essential to the restoration of a democratic constitutional order in Venezuela. We call on the Venezuelan Government to fulfill its commitments under the OAS charter and under the Inter-American Democratic Charter. We support the Lima Group\u2019s January 23rd statement that calls for an inclusive and transparent democratic process. I could take some questions for you all on that in just a minute.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Regarding Qatar, we are happy to announce that we will be holding the inaugural United States-Qatar strategic dialogue. It will be here at the State Department on Tuesday, January the 30th. Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis will co-chair the opening session of the dialogue jointly with our Qatari counterparts, Deputy Prime Minister \u2013 excuse me, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister al-Thani and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for State of Defense al-Attiyah \u2013 pardon me. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019re pleased to host the senior Qatari officials at an event that reaffirms our close ties and commitments to cultivating a strategic relationship with the state of Qatar. They\u2019re a strategic partner and we seek to use this dialogue to deepen our collaboration with them. We look forward to discussing many important areas of cooperation between our countries, including trade, investment, defense, security, law enforcement, counterterrorism, and also aviation. We also talk about the critical regional issues of defeating ISIS, the ongoing Gulf disputes, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then in terms of the Secretary today, as you all know, he is at Davos accompanying the President as part of the U.S. delegation. When the Secretary travels with the President, he pretty much follows the President\u2019s schedule, so he was a part of some of the President\u2019s meetings today, including with Benjamin Netanyahu. The Secretary also held a meeting today with Nechirvan Barzani and also with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq. This evening \u2013 excuse me, that takes place this evening.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN:</b> Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Has that happened already? That happened already, okay. So I don\u2019t have the details or any readouts of those meetings, but I know you probably saw what the \u2013 or heard what the Secretary said going into his meeting with Barzani earlier. The Secretary will remain in Davos tonight before he heads to Warsaw tomorrow afternoon. In Poland, he\u2019ll meet with senior Polish officials to discuss the range of issues in the strong U.S.-Poland bilateral relationship, including global challenges, regional security, and also economic prosperity. He will also participate \u2013 the Secretary will \u2013 in a wreath-laying ceremony Sunday \u2013 excuse me, Saturday marks the \u2013 is it the 75th anniversary of --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN:</b> Seventy-third.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Pardon me?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN:</b> Seventy-third. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Seventy-third anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. And so he is going to be there to mark that day. Let\u2019s see.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>(Off-mike.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I believe \u2013 no, no, no. It\u2019s --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN: </b>It will be in --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>-- at a \u2013 it\u2019s a memorial, right? Is it \u2013 yeah. Let me look at our detailed scheduled here that I think has some additional information on it. He\u2019ll be at the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>This is \u2013 but the wreath he\u2019s laying is to the people who died in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, right? It\u2019s not specifically related to Auschwitz? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know that Saturday marks that day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Okay.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>So I believe it was \u2013 yes, both. Because you wouldn\u2019t go just commemorate Auschwitz without acknowledging what had happened in Warsaw as well. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary will also meet with mission personnel before heading back to the U.S. Okay. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for that --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Question about --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b> Yeah. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Middle East.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>-- aid to the Palestinians. President Trump said that aid is now on the table for everything. What are you telling the Palestinians? Is this all U.S. aid is now under review? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>You saw our position on UNRWA. The President has now spoken. He made his comments, so I\u2019m not going to speak for the President, but --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>But this is beyond UNRWA, this is --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>-- bilateral aid.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Right, right.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Does that mean that you guys are reviewing all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians and that --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>-- it\u2019s dependent on peace talks?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think there are a lot of things under review. I know the President sees \u2013 and I can\u2019t speak for the President, but the President sees that nothing has happened with regard to the peace process over many decades. And they\u2019re looking for ways to get people back to the table and get people back to peace talks. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>The U.S. Government has given the Palestinian Authority aid to support its security forces for many years and part of that has been an effort to help them prevent attacks on Israelis. Is that under review too?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m not aware of that. I can check on that and get back to you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Heather, has --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Heather, the President mentioned that \u2013 possibly cutting off aid in the same sentence that he mentioned the Palestinians disrespecting Vice President Pence by not letting him visit. Is slighting of the Vice President one of the factors the U.S. is taking into consideration as it reviews future aid to the Palestinians? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m not going to speak on behalf of the President, so I\u2019m going to let his comments stand for themselves, but one of the things that we are doing is looking for ways to kind of shake things up a bit, to try to get both sides to come back to the table. And we look forward to trying to facilitate any kind of peace talks.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Can I ask you on UNRWA? You mentioned that UNRWA needs to be reformed. Has this administration given UNRWA a specific list of demands of the things that it wants to see reformed?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>We have spoken with representatives from UNRWA. We\u2019ve also spoken with other countries about the need to get other countries to provide more money and resources for UNRWA. We\u2019re pleased some countries have stepped up. Belgium is one of those countries that has; there are some others as well. So we\u2019re pleased that other countries recognize that they\u2019re \u2013 other countries need to do more. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In terms of the first part of your question, have we given specifics to UNRWA? Yes. Some of those are just \u2013 we consider to be more private diplomatic type conversations, but we have made clear to them the need to reform their funding mechanism, for example. The Secretary has spoken about this here at the State Department where he said, look, every year at the end of the year there is an emergency appeal for money. The system and the structure shouldn\u2019t be set up in such a way that every year they are running out of money and need to plead for emergency funds. So it\u2019s just not a sustainable program the way the funding mechanism is currently set up, and so we are promoting for UNRWA to develop a funding mechanism structure that is better sustaining. So that would be one of the examples, and we could -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Could you talk a little bit about why you \u2013 why you think that by cutting these funds for economic development programs, humanitarian aid, why that will do anything other than make people more hungry and angry and frustrated and drawn to radicalism?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I\u2019m just going to go back to what the President said before. And I\u2019m not quoting him, but in general we have seen a lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process for many, many decades \u2013 more decades than some of you have been alive. And so there needs to be a new way to try to get people back to the table, and perhaps this is one way that it can encourage and will encourage both sides to eventually return to the peace process.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Are you blaming only the Palestinians or primarily the Palestinians -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> -- for that situation recently?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we\u2019ve talked to both the Israelis and we\u2019ve certainly made clear to the Palestinian \u2013 Palestinians in the past that both sides need to come to the table, and that it\u2019s not going to be easy. Both sides will have to compromise.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> The President --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And you\u2019re quite clear that the Israelis are ready to come to the table?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think they are. I think they are. They\u2019ve indicated that in the recent past, so I don\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard or seen anything that would indicate otherwise.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> The President again stressed repeatedly today that he\u2019s taken Jerusalem off the table. Now that\u2019s done, that issue is done, he kept saying. Is Jerusalem off the table for negotiations?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>In what way?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Whether or not \u2013 I mean, the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as their future capital. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> That would be -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So is that off the table for the Palestinians?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>That would be a final status negotiation that would have to be determined by the Israelis and the Palestinians. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But he says he\u2019s taken it off the table.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think \u2013 and I can\u2019t parse the President\u2019s words. I\u2019m not in the position to do so. I think you all recognize that. But I think what the President was referring to at the time \u2013 if you go back and look at the time in which that was said, I think he was referring to \u2013 saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel from a U.S. perspective. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But he also said that the Israelis will have to pay for that in future talks. He said that again today.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Well, then I\u2019d have to refer you to the White House on that, because I can\u2019t speak for the President and I wasn\u2019t there as part of the comments.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Just to be clear \u2013 because the two things seem to have overlapped a bit in this discussion \u2013 the withholding of the money to UNRWA is to get UNRWA reformed?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Reformed, yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> It has nothing to do with whether the Palestinians come to the negotiating table?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>That is correct. Yes. And we have --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So what the President is talking about today is different aid?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes. I think he\u2019s talking about aid in general. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Okay?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So can I ask why --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And why does the State Department --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Do you guys want to stick on Israeli-Palestinian stuff? Because I\u2019m going to have to go quickly. Is that \u2013 do you want to talk about other things?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can I have a quick one on Turkey about yesterday\u2019s phone call between President Trump and Erdogan?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> It seems that the Turks are telling \u2013 claiming there is a mischaracterization of the content of the call in the White House readout. What do you make of this claim from Turkey?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think our \u2013 the call readout that was provided by the White House was very specific, it was very detailed, and it was firm. And I think it expressed both the President and the Secretary\u2019s extreme concern about the situation in northwestern Syria, in the Afrin area. So I think they were clear about that. I think the President and the Secretary \u2013 as the Secretary has in recent calls with the foreign minister of Turkey \u2013 been very clear that we want a de-escalation of tensions. This is a part of Syria that had been relatively stable. Again, it\u2019s Syria, but it had been relatively stable. And now we\u2019re <span><span><span>seeing something altogether different happen. We recognize and respect Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns, their concerns about the PKK. Turkey is a NATO partner and ally, so we understand and respect that, but I want to make something clear, that we don\u2019t have a U.S. presence in Afrin. Our U.S. presence is elsewhere. It\u2019s more in the eastern part of the country, where we\u2019ve been fighting \u2013 where we have been fighting ISIS. So we\u2019re not a part of that. We work with the Syrian Democratic Forces in the eastern part of that country to fight ISIS. We continue to do that, so \u2013 and we encourage the Turks and everybody else to put the focus on ISIS and not other groups.</span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Heather, the Turkish foreign minister and other Turkish officials said publicly that Tillerson proposed this idea for a 30-kilometer buffer zone. Tillerson said, \u201cI didn\u2019t propose anything.\u201d The Turks have come back and said no, really, you did. Do you have any clarity on \u2013 I mean, did they discuss it but it wasn\u2019t a formal proposal, or \u2013 can you, like, parse that for us?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>Yeah, and we put out some comments on this yesterday, and I want to talk a little bit about some of what the Secretary said. And he talked to I believe one of the pool reporters today when he landed in Davos. He said, \u201cWe discussed a number of possible options, but we didn\u2019t propose anything.\u201d So back to the readout for a second that was provided, we stand by the readout. We stand by the President\u2019s assertion of cautioning Turkey about the escalation of tensions in the Afrin area, and then the Secretary I think has also been clear by saying, look, we discussed a range of options with the Turks.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Was the 30-mile or kilometer buffer zone one of them?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I don\u2019t have that level of specificity that I can provide to you, but I think there was no formal proposal of anything. I think the Secretary was talking with Turkey \u2013 NATO ally \u2013 about hey, what do you all need, just as though he would talk to the Kurds, because he was speaking with Barzani today. So he\u2019s talking with both sides about what they would all need.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> The Turks are talking \u2013 you were saying that you\u2019re not involved in Afrin, but they\u2019re talking about moving on to Manbij, which \u2013 where there is a U.S. military base. Has the Secretary kind of drawn any red lines about where they can go?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>We have been clear with the Turks.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Have we relocated any U.S. personnel out of Manbij to make sure they don\u2019t get bombed by the Turks?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>State Department personnel?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Or U.S.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I \u2013 yeah, I can\u2019t comment on any DOD personnel because I just wouldn\u2019t have that level of knowledge, but I\u2019m not aware of any State Department personnel who\u2019ve been moved.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Can you explain what you mean \u2013 what \u2013 that Tillerson has been clear? Because Michele asked you whether he\u2019d drawn any red lines if they move to Manbij. What \u2013 when you say that Tillerson\u2019s been clear, clear about what?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>We\u2019ve been clear with \u2013 and some of these conversations I just can\u2019t get into that level of specificity, but we\u2019ve been very clear with the Turkish Government, Turkish officials both on the ground in Turkey and in the Secretary\u2019s private conversations with the foreign minister, as well as with President Trump\u2019s conversations with President Erdogan, that we do not want to see an escalation of tensions in any way, shape, or form. And part of that would of course include the town, the community of Manbij.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Right, but the \u2013 but in terms of any U.S. action if the \u2013 because the U.S. troops are there.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I\u2019m not going to go forward with what we may or may not do, but all of them have made it clear that that would be an area that would be of major concern.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> And what is your level of confidence that the Turks are hearing those messages?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re putting those messages out. We certainly hope that they will listen. As a NATO partner and ally, we think they should. We think that that would be a good thing. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not the only country that has this concern about an escalation of tensions. </span></span></span>There are many other partners and allies who are equally concerned about instability in Syria and taking the eye off of ISIS.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Would you say that the Turks have given assurances of any kind, or how would you characterize --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> I would not say that they\u2019ve given assurances. We\u2019re following this very closely. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Quick one on Burma/Myanmar.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have anything to say with regard to former Secretary Richardson\u2019s comments from yesterday beyond what you said yesterday? And secondly, were his comments in any way whatsoever coordinated with the State Department or the Trump administration?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> No, they were not coordinated with the administration. They were not. I can tell you that we share his concern. You all read his letter. It was very frank. He was not operating under the auspices of the U.S. Government. He was over there as a private citizen. And I think it was certainly a good opportunity, and we were certainly hopeful that he was named to that commission, but I\u2019ll let his words speak for themselves about what he felt \u2013 how he felt that commission was going.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And what makes you think that the criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi is going to strengthen either her ability or her will to try to do some of the things that you would like seen done in Burma?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we didn\u2019t put out that statement. That was put out by Ambassador Richardson.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But you said, \u201cWe share his concerns.\u201d</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we share his concern. Yeah, absolutely.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Right, right. So by that, I take it as kind of an endorsement with what he said. You share the concerns that he has, so --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, let me back up, then, because I can\u2019t endorse his actual words because he\u2019s not operating on behalf of the U.S. Government. But certainly it is a concerning situation and certainly we would like to see the advisory commission be able to help the situation there.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> What I don\u2019t get is why starting to be more explicit in criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi will necessarily help her or make her any more inclined to push the country in the direction that you would like against the wishes of the military, which still basically have more power under their constitution than she does. So -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> As you know, we\u2019ve had a series of conversations with the government there, both with Aung San Suu Kyi and also General Min. Those conversations are ongoing with the government in general. Our people on the ground, Ambassador Scot Marciel is very involved in this. So we continue to have those conversations. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We would eventually like to see the Rohingya be able to go home in a safe and voluntary fashion. We don\u2019t believe that it would be safe or voluntary if they were to be sent home right now. We\u2019re continuing to monitor that situation. It is a tremendous concern of the United States Government. We have put a lot of money, a lot of taxpayer dollars, into assisting the Rohingya both in Bangladesh and in Burma as well. So it remains a concern. We certainly note what Ambassador Richardson said about his concerns and why he says he\u2019s pulling out of the commission panel.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t think that undermines Aung San Suu Kyi?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, that was his \u2013 it was his choice. It was certainly his choice because he had concerns about the way that the advisory panel was running. And so I\u2019d just refer you back to his comments about that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, one of their tension points that both he has discussed and Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman has said is that he wanted to address the fate of these Reuters journalists who were actually there specifically investigating what happened to the Rohingya, and that the position of Myanmar\u2019s Government is these are completely unrelated because this is a press freedom thing, this is a Rohingya thing. Is it the position of the United States that the fate of those journalists is completely untethered from the Rohingya crisis?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve stated whether it\u2019s tied to it or it\u2019s not. It\u2019s certainly related. It\u2019s certainly related to democratic reforms that we would like to see take place in that country. I mean, we consistently call for greater press access to allow press to go out and report the facts. And one of our major concerns about the situation in the Northern Rakhine State is that reporters \u2013 and frankly, aid groups to some extent \u2013 have not been able to get in to report what\u2019s going on on the ground. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So I don\u2019t have the specifics of the reporters\u2019 case. I mean, I\u2019ve read reports, but I can\u2019t personally confirm what exactly the reporters were doing there. But if they were just out reporting the facts, and reporting the reality and the situation on the ground, that deserves to be shared with the world.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019re going to have to get going in a few minutes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> India is hosting \u2013 this time I\u2019ll go on. India is hosting Asian countries\u2019 leaders this \u2013 today or tomorrow for the --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have anything on that, the relations between India and Asian countries, part of the India-U.S. collaboration with East Asia?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have any information on this meeting. I know that Alice Wells was recently in India. When does she --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, I see that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I don\u2019t have the dates for that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>I see that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>She was \u2013 yeah. She was recently there within the past few days or so. But I don\u2019t have anything on \u2013 for you on that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Last one, Heather?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And \u2013 and on Pakistan, Pakistan has said that any unilateral action from the U.S. \u2013 they were referring in terms of a drone attack yesterday \u2013 would be detrimental to the U.S.-Pakistan cooperation. How do you see their statement?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I don\u2019t have any comment on that story you\u2019re referring to.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think that some of that would be DOD.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can I ask really quickly do you have a readout of Susan Thornton\u2019s meetings in Asia?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I do not. Her trip is still ongoing, so we hope to get a readout for you all upon her return if we\u2019re able to do that. I can tell you she was in Indonesia, she was in Mongolia, and she was in China. Big topic, of course, regional issues and the DPRK and our maximum pressure campaign.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have any sense what Susan \u2013 what kind of reception Susan had in Beijing and what the Chinese reaction was to what was decided in Vancouver?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know she talked about the DPRK and our maximum pressure campaign. And we consistently ask for China to do more. That\u2019s one of the things with the regard to putting pressure on the DPRK, that\u2019s one of the things that she did address with them, of course.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, but they were pretty critical of this Vancouver meeting coming up. They said they didn\u2019t think it would accomplish much. And I was wondering if she had any indication they warmed up to what was discussed there, and what was the efforts?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know we\u2019ll keep pushing and keep talking to the Chinese Government and ask them to apply maximum pressure along with us. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, is the Secretary upset that USAID has suspended their participation in the overhaul?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I haven\u2019t asked him that question. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s aware of that particular report.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can you \u2013 can you \u2013 do you have anything more to say about that, about whether \u2013 I mean is AID cooperating with his redesign, or how\u2019s it going?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t know the status of that. That was actually something Robert was spending his whole day on while I was dealing with Turkey yesterday, so I\u2019ll refer you to Robert on that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN: </b>We\u2019ve got to go, though. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN: </b>We\u2019ve got to get you over there.

Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n<p>\n\tWell, good morning. And I really, really appreciate this opportunity to swing down to Stanford while I was out on the West Coast and particularly to address this group. And I want to thank Stanford and the Hoover Institution and the international studies group for allowing me to speak to you this morning. I have familiarity with the Hoover Institution; I\u2019ve spoken at some of their events in the past in my prior life, and it has consistently produced great, principled scholarship that makes the calls for representative government, private enterprise, and protecting the American way of life right at the center of your activities, and very important topics that we spend our time on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in that regard, you certainly have a true advocate in your ranks: my friend, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who \u2013 I don\u2019t know if she takes responsibility for this situation she got me into or not, but I \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I hold her partially accountable anyway. And \u2013 but I appreciate Condi\u2019s advice and counsel. When you arrive at the Secretary of State\u2019s desk, I was looking for the how-to manual; there wasn\u2019t one there. So she\u2019s been a great source of help and inspiration to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I also want to acknowledge the other co-host, one of our nation\u2019s most dedicated and gifted public servants, certainly of the 20th century: former Secretary George Shultz. And George and I have known each other a long time as well, and I\u2019m a great admirer of his work as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ve just come from a ministerial meeting in Vancouver, in which a number of nations discussed how to better implement our maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. The United States and our allies are and continue to be united in continuing this campaign until North Korea takes meaningful steps toward denuclearization. We all agreed \u2013 all of us \u2013 that we will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom Vancouver I made a quick swing down here to California. And I appreciated Dr. Rice\u2019s help in arranging this for me on somewhat short notice. There are some people back in Washington that are suspicious I\u2019m escaping the bad weather today to just come down here, but I am delighted to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe topic and the subject of my remarks today is to talk with you about the way forward for the United States in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m going to start by giving you a kind of a broad historical and political context for what are some very difficult situations facing the Syrian people, and they raise concerns for all of the international powers as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen I want to describe why it is crucial to our national defense to maintain a military and diplomatic presence in Syria, to help bring an end to that conflict, and assist the Syrian people as they chart a course to achieve a new political future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then lastly, I want to detail the steps this administration is taking to achieve a stable, unified, and independent Syria, free of terrorist threats and free of weapons of mass destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen, as indicated, Dr. Rice and I will have a little conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor nearly 50 years, the Syrian people have suffered under the dictatorship of Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar al-Assad. The nature of the Assad regime, like that of its sponsor Iran, is malignant. It has promoted state terror. It has empowered groups that kill American soldiers, such as al-Qaida. It has backed Hizballah and Hamas. And it has violently suppressed political opposition. Bashar al-Assad\u2019s grand strategy, to the extent he has one beyond his own survival, includes hosting some of the most radical terrorist elements in the region and using them to destabilize his neighbors. Assad\u2019s regime is corrupt, and his methods of governance and economic development have increasingly excluded certain ethnic and religious groups. His human rights record is notorious the world over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSuch oppression cannot persist forever. And over the years, latent anger built up within the country, and many Syrians rose up and opposed Assad\u2019s rule. Within the days of what began as peaceful demonstrations that swept Syria in 2011, Assad and his regime responded to his own people with bullets and jail sentences.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSince that time, the story of Syria has been one of a humanitarian catastrophe. Up to half a million Syrians have died. Over 5.4 million Syrians are refugees, and 6.1 million are internally displaced persons, or IDPs. And as a result of conflict between regime and opposition forces, whole cities have been destroyed. It will take years to rebuild an entire nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPrevious American efforts to halt the conflict have been ineffective. When Assad used chemical weapons on his own people in 2013, in defiance of an American red line threat to retaliate, U.S. inaction emboldened the regime to further disregard civilian lives. In April of last year, the Trump administration responded to Assad\u2019s use of sarin nerve agent on civilians with cruise missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of Assad\u2019s air force. We did this to degrade the Syrian military\u2019s ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks, to protect innocent civilians, and to dissuade the Syrian regime from further use or proliferation of chemical weapons. The United States takes chemical weapons threats seriously, and we cannot stand idly by and allow their use to become regularized. We will continue to seek accountability and justice for the victims of that attack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2012, the Assad regime military forces began to struggle badly against armed opposition. The regime was soon bolstered through the assistance of Iranian-backed fighting forces. But despite this help, by August of 2015, Syrian rebel forces had made substantial progress against Assad\u2019s regime. Fearing for his own survival, Assad then appealed to Russia, his longtime ally, for help. Russia intervened to save the regime, largely by providing increased air power, intelligence, and arms support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn December of 2016, the key city of Aleppo fell to the regime after a brutal campaign that essentially destroyed that city, which had a population over two million people before the war. This symbolized the regime\u2019s ruthless determination to regain momentum in the conflict. It also led to \u2013 Assad to wrongly think that he would maintain power without addressing the Syrian regime\u2019s \u2013 the Syrian people\u2019s legitimate grievances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe civil war in Syria was horrific in and of itself. But Syria was thrown into an even greater state of turmoil with the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. This was an aspiring terror-state inside the borders of Iraq and Syria. The conflict between the regime and various opposition groups fighting to change Assad\u2019s grip on power created the conditions for the rapid expansion of ISIS in 2013 and 2014. ISIS originally emerged from the ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq, a group Assad had covertly backed. Evidence suggests Assad also abetted ISIS by releasing known terrorists from Syrian prisons and turning a blind eye to ISIS\u2019s growth. ISIS exploited the instability and lack of centralized authority in Syria to set up what it falsely claimed was a \u201ccaliphate,\u201d with the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital. Eventually, ISIS expanded to possess at its height a territory \u2013 an amount of territory roughly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom, and a significant fighting force. Flush with cash from looted banks and in control of oil fields in Syria and Iraq, ISIS had all the elements to sustain itself and carry out attacks on the U.S. homeland and those of our allies. The establishment of a radical terror-state attracted thousands of jihadists from over 100 countries, and motivated other terrorists around the world to commit attacks where they live.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the wake of the rise of ISIS, millions fled their homes, villages, and cities to escape the brutal regime\u2019s ethnic cleansing, resulting in massive refugee flows into the neighboring countries and as far as Europe and Scandinavia. By the middle of 2014, ISIS had a stable base of operations in Syria and significant revenue streams to fund, plan, inspire, and direct attacks against targets in the West and against our regional allies. It was using Syria to build chemical weapons for use against our partners. Recognizing the destructive power of a strengthening terrorist organization, America focused on a military defeat of ISIS. In spite of the threat ISIS posed in Syria, Assad focused instead on fighting the Syrian opposition, even with Iranian and Russian military support at his back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Trump administration\u2019s counterterrorism policy is quite simple. It is to protect Americans at home and abroad from attacks by terrorists. Central to this policy is to deny terrorist and terrorist organizations the opportunity to organize, raise money, recruit fighters, train, plan, and execute attacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen he took office, President Trump took decisive action to accelerate the gains that were being made in Syria and Iraq. He directed Secretary of Defense Mattis to present within 30 days a new plan for defeating ISIS. The President quickly approved that plan. He directed a pace of operations that would achieve decisive results quickly, delegating greater authority to American commanders in the field, and he gave our military leaders more freedom to determine and apply the tactics that would best lead to ISIS\u2019s defeat. Today, nearly all territory in Iraq and Syria once controlled by ISIS, or approximately 98 percent of all of that once United Kingdom-sized territory, has been liberated, and ISIS has not been able to regain one foot of that ground. ISIS\u2019s physical \u201ccaliphate\u201d of Raqqa is destroyed. The liberated capital of the caliphate no longer serves as a magnet for those hoping to build a terrorist empire. Approximately 3.2 million Syrians and 4.5 million Iraqis have been freed from the tyranny of ISIS. Over 3 million internally displaced Iraqis are now back home, and Mosul, the caliphate\u2019s second capital city in Iraq and one of Iraq\u2019s largest cities, is completely clear of ISIS. In Iraq, for the first time since the beginning of the crisis in December of 2013, there are more Iraqis going home than there are that are still displaced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we survey Syria today, we see the big picture, a situation characterized by principally three factors:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tISIS is substantially, but not completely defeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime controls about half of Syria\u2019s territory and its population.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd continued strategic threats to the U.S. from not just ISIS and al-Qaida, but from others persist. And this threat I\u2019m referring to is principally Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of its strategy to create a northern arch, stretching from Iran to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, Iran has dramatically strengthened its presence in Syria by deploying Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops; supporting Lebanese Hizballah; and importing proxy forces from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere. Through its position in Syria, Iran is positioning to continue attacking U.S. interests, our allies, and personnel in the region. It is spending billions of dollars a year to prop up Assad and wage proxy wars at the expense of supporting its own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, the unresolved plight of millions of Syrian refugees and IDPs remains a humanitarian crisis. The catastrophic state of affairs is directly related to the continued lack of security and legitimate governance in Syria itself. Assad has gassed his own people, he has barrel bombed entire villages and urban neighborhoods, and repeatedly undermined any chance for a peaceful resolution of political differences. Those abuses continue to this day, as seen in recent civilian casualties in East Ghouta and Idlib Governance<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>. There is no way to effectively facilitate a large-scale safe and voluntary return of refugees without a political solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn short, Syria remains a source of severe strategic threats, and a major challenge for our diplomacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the United States will continue to remain engaged as a means to protect our own national security interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States desires five key end states for Syria:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, ISIS and al-Qaida in Syria suffer an enduring defeat, do not present a threat to the homeland, and do not resurface in a new form; that Syria never again serves as a platform or safe haven for terrorists to organize, recruit, finance, train and carry out attacks on American citizens at home or abroad or against our allies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, the underlying conflict between the Syrian people and the Assad regime is resolved through a UN-led political process prescribed in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and a stable, unified, independent Syria, under post-Assad leadership, is functioning as a state.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iranian influence in Syria is diminished, their dreams of a northern arch are denied, and Syria\u2019s neighbors are secure from all threats emanating from Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFourth, conditions are created so that the refugees and IDPs can begin to safely and voluntarily return to Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd fifth, Syria is free of weapons of mass destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Trump administration is implementing a new strategy to achieve these end states. This process largely entails increased diplomatic action on the heels of our ongoing military successes. Our diplomatic efforts will be characterized by stabilization initiatives and a new emphasis on the political solution to the Syrian conflict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut let us be clear: The United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge. Our military mission in Syria will remain conditions-based. We cannot make the same mistakes that were made in 2011 when a premature departure from Iraq allowed al-Qaida in Iraq to survive and eventually morph into ISIS. It was that vacuum that allowed ISIS and other terrorist organizations to wreak havoc on the country. And it gave ISIS a safe haven to plan attacks against Americans and our allies. We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria. ISIS presently has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe understand that some Americans are skeptical of continued involvement in Syria and question the benefits of maintaining a presence in such a troubled country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHowever, it is vital for the United States to remain engaged in Syria for several reasons: Ungoverned spaces, especially in conflict zones, are breeding grounds for ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The fight against ISIS is not over. There are bands of ISIS fighters who are already beginning to wage an insurgency. We and our allies will hunt them down and kill them or capture them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, we must persist in Syria to thwart al-Qaida, which still has a substantial presence and base of operations in northwest Syria. As in the years before 9/11, al-Qaida is eager to create a sanctuary to plan and launch attacks on the West. Although ISIS is the terrorist group that has dominated the headlines most in the last few years, al-Qaida is still a grave threat and is looking to reconstitute in new and powerful ways.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, a total withdrawal of American personnel at this time would restore Assad and continue his brutal treatment against his own people. A murderer of his own people cannot generate the trust required for long-term stability. A stable, unified, and independent Syria ultimately requires post-Assad leadership in order to be successful. Continued U.S. presence to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS will also help pave the way for legitimate local civil authorities to exercise responsible governance of their liberated areas. The departure of Assad through the UN-led Geneva process will create the conditions for a durable peace within Syria and security along the borders for Syria\u2019s neighbors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tU.S. disengagement from Syria would provide Iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in Syria. As we have seen from Iran\u2019s proxy wars and public announcements, Iran seeks dominance in the Middle East and the destruction of our ally, Israel. As a destabilized nation and one bordering Israel, Syria presents an opportunity that Iran is all too eager to exploit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, consistent with our values, America has the opportunity to help a people which has suffered greatly. We must give Syrians a chance to return home and rebuild their lives. The safe and voluntary return of Syrian refugees serves the security interests of the United States, our allies, and our partners. To relieve the enormous pressure of refugee flows on the surrounding region and on Europe, conditions must be created for these refugees to safely and voluntarily return home. It will be impossible to ensure stability on one end of the Mediterranean, in Europe, if chaos and injustice prevail on the other end, in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, along with its allies and partners, will undertake the following steps to bring stability and peace to Syria:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, stabilization initiatives in liberated areas are essential to making sure that life can return to normal and ISIS does not re-emerge. Stabilization initiatives consist of essential measures such as clearing unexploded land mines left behind by ISIS, allowing hospitals to reopen, restoring water and electricity services, and getting boys and girls back in school. The approach has proved successful in Iraq, where millions of Iraqis have returned to their homes. In Syria, however, unlike in Iraq, we do not have a national government partner for stabilization efforts, so we must work with others. As such, there is a great deal of difficulty to them. Since May, the United States has deployed additional diplomats to the affected areas in Syria, working with the United Nations, our partners in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and various nongovernmental organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur work to help local and regional authorities provide services to liberated areas builds trust between local populations and local leaders who are returning. Terrorists thrive under conditions that allow them to peddle their warped and hateful messages to vulnerable people in conflict-stricken areas. Our stabilization efforts will help those people turn away from the prospect of terrorism and toward integration in their local communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe must be clear: \u201cStabilization\u201d is not a synonym for open-ended nation-building or a synonym for reconstruction. But it is essential. No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone. Our military presence is backed by State Department and USAID teams who are already working with local authorities to help liberated peoples stabilize their own communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimultaneous with stabilization efforts, de-escalating the overall conflict is also a critical step to creating the conditions for a post-Assad political settlement. Since July, the United States has worked with Russia and Jordan to establish the de-escalation area in the southwest part of Syria. It has achieved a ceasefire, ended indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations, and with some few exceptions, has thus far held up well. The agreement in the southwest also addresses Israel\u2019s security by requiring Iranian-backed militias, most notably Hizballah, to move away from Israel\u2019s border. We need Russia to continue to work with the United States and Jordan to enforce this de-escalation area. If it does, the resulting cessation of regime-opposition hostilities will allow for the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, create the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees, and provide the Syrian people the security to start rebuilding areas scarred by conflict. Our efforts have been \u2013 have helped refugees and IDPs return into the southwest de-escalation areas from where they had taken refuge in Jordan, and overall, an estimated 715,000 Syrians in total, including 50,000 Syrians from abroad, returned to their homes in 2017. These early but positive trends can increase through the continuation of de-escalation efforts not just in the southwest, but elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn counterterrorism, we will continue to work with allies and partners, such as Turkey, to address the terror threat in Idlib and address Turkey\u2019s concern with PKK terrorists elsewhere. Al-Qaida is attempting to re-establish a base of operation for itself in Idlib. We are actively developing the best option to neutralize this threat in conjunction with allies and partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is vigorously supporting UN efforts to achieve the political solution under UN Security Council Resolution 2254. This is the political framework for peace and stability in a unified Syria which has already been agreed upon by members of the UN Security Council. Specifically, we will work through what is known as the Geneva process, supporting UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime clearly looks to Russia as a guarantor of its security. Russia therefore has a meaningful role to play in persuading the Assad regime to engage constructively in the Geneva process. Beyond Russia\u2019s own vote to support UNSCR 2254, President Putin reaffirmed Russia\u2019s commitment to Geneva in his joint statement with President Trump issued from<span> Da Nang, Vietnam </span>last November. The United States and Russia have worked together on the southwest de-escalation area to success, and we have established deconfliction arrangements around the Euphrates River Valley to ensure the safety of our respective forces.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRussia must now follow through on the commitment our presidents made last November to find an ultimate solution through the UN-led Geneva process. One of the ways Russia can do that is to exert its unique leverage on the Syrian regime, which itself has agreed to participate in the Geneva process. Russia must put new levels of pressure on the regime to not just show up in Geneva but to credibly engage with the UN\u2019s efforts and implement agreed outcomes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, the EU, and regional partners will not provide international reconstruction assistance to any area under control of the Assad regime. We ask all stakeholders in Syria\u2019s future to do the same. We will discourage economic relationships between the Assad regime and any other country. Instead, we will encourage international assistance to rebuild areas the global coalition and its local partners have liberated from ISIS. Once Assad is gone from power, the United States will gladly encourage the normalization of economic relationships between Syria and other nations. The United States calls on all nations to exercise discipline in economically pressuring Assad and rebuilding Syria after a political transition. Our expectation is that the desire for a return to normal life and these tools of pressure will help rally the Syrian people and individuals within the regime to compel Assad to step aside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUNSCR 2254 also calls for UN-supervised free elections in Syria. The United States believes that free and transparent elections, to include the participation of the Syrian diaspora who have been displaced \u2013 all those who were forced to flee the conflict \u2013 will result in the permanent departure of Assad and his family from power. This process will take time, and we urge patience in the departure of Assad and the establishment of new leadership. Responsible change may not come as immediate as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform, UN-supervised elections \u2013 but that change will come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States recognizes and honors the great sacrifices the Syrian Democratic Forces have made in liberating Syrians from ISIS, but its victories on the battlefield do not solve the challenge of local governance and representation for people of eastern and northern Syria. Interim local political arrangements that give voice to all groups and ethnicities supportive of Syria\u2019s broader political transition must emerge with international support. Any interim arrangements must be truly representative and must not threaten any of Syria\u2019s neighboring states. Similarly, the voices of Syrians from these regions must be heard in Geneva and in the broader discussion about Syria\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn these points, the United States hears and takes seriously the concerns of our NATO ally Turkey. We recognize the humanitarian contributions and military sacrifices Turkey has made towards defeating ISIS, towards their support of millions of Syrian refugees, and stabilizing areas of Syria it has helped liberate. We must have Turkey\u2019s close cooperation in achieving a new future for Syria that ensures security for Syria\u2019s neighbors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, reducing and expelling malicious Iranian influence from Syria depends on a democratic Syria. For many years, Syria under Bashar al-Assad has been a client state of Iran. A Syrian central government that is not under the control of Assad will have new legitimacy to assert its authority over the country. The reassertion of national sovereignty by a new government, along with de-escalation efforts and new flows of international aid, will lower violence, set better conditions for stability, and speed up the departure of foreign fighters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize Syria presents many complexities. Our proposed solutions will not be easy to achieve. But it is necessary to proceed in these ways for the sake of our security and that of our allies. We will not repeat mistakes of the past in Iraq, nor will we repeat the mistakes made in Libya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell-intentioned military interventions independent of stabilization and political strategies give rise to a host of adverse, unintended consequences. For this reason, we seek to de-escalate the civil war in Syria, work for peace, and encourage all parties to head to the negotiating table. Continued fighting will likely lead to worsened humanitarian conditions, more chaos, and increased regional military intervention in Syria. Our focus is to build a positive political path forward that honors the will of the Syrian people and sustains the unity and territorial integrity of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs with almost all of our foreign policy challenges, the steps for achieving our objectives cannot be undertaken alone. We will continue to work closely with allies and partners. In suffering many terrorist attacks over the past few years, our allies in Europe have sadly experienced firsthand what groups like ISIS and al-Qaida are capable of. We need allies and partners to support our strategy in order to permanently mitigate the risk to security posed by these terrorist organizations and others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, the Syrian people have endured seven years of unimaginable chaos and hardship. They need help. A new course of action is a preferable alternative to more years of wishful thinking. A stable, unified, independent Syria will serve the national security interests of the United States, its allies, and our partners. If that reality can come to pass, it will be a victory for all, and it will support the ability of the Syrian people to pursue their own God-given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for your kind attention, and I look forward to our discussion.

Thank you very much for that comprehensive look at one of the most daunting problems that, I think, anyone in the international system has faced, and I\u2019d like to return to a couple of substantive issues, but I want to ask you a question first about being Secretary of State. It\u2019s kind of a hard job, isn\u2019t it? (Laughter.)\n\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>It\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s a little different. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> Yeah. (Laughter). So, when I was secretary, I\u2019d get up in the morning, and there were some things I\u2019d see on my calendar, and I\u2019d think, \u201cOh good, I\u2019m going to get to do that,\u201d and then there were some things that I\u2019d would think, \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll just go back to bed.\u201d What do you like about the job, and what do you find most challenging?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, what I like most about the job is what I\u2019ve always enjoyed throughout my career, and it\u2019s the quality of the people you have the privilege to work with every day. And what I\u2019ll say about the people in the State Department, the career people as well as the political appointees: These are extraordinarily dedicated individuals, some of the greatest patriots you\u2019ll meet anywhere, and they really come in every day with one objective in mind, and that\u2019s to carry out the foreign policy goals, objectives of the administration, but to serve the interests of the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what I look forward to every day is even if we\u2019re talking about really complicated issues, like the one I just described \u2013 and Syria is one of the most complex situations on the ground \u2013 the level of intelligence and the level of openness for us to have a good conversation about that is what I most look forward to. And I have a bullpen area \u2013 it used to be the Deputy Secretary of Management\u2019s office. I absconded it, and we have nothing but whiteboards in there, and I love going in the bullpen and just whiteboarding these exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat I least look forward to coming in to are those days when I have to deal with the loss of life. And whether it\u2019s the loss of a State Department person, or the loss of military personnel, or any American citizen anywhere, those are the days that are difficult, because you make calls to family members, you try to \u2013 people who have been taken hostage, you try to give their families reassurance, but those are the days that are really tough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Yeah. Now, as Secretary, you face some unique challenges as well. Social media was barely born when I was secretary. Thank God for that. And we know that your boss loves social media, so what\u2019s it like, and how do you deal with the constant pressure of social media, especially out of the White House?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, he\u2019s world class at social media and I\u2019m not \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and I want to confess here in the heart of the creation of this great technology, I have no social media accounts. I have never had any and I don\u2019t intend to have any. (Laughter.) It is a great tool when it\u2019s used well. The President has used it to great effect by bypassing the traditional means of communicating, and he absolutely thrives on this ability to instantly communicate not just to the American people, but to our friends and allies or to our adversaries, to the entire world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to do that because he \u2013 that is just the way the President operates. So the challenge is just getting caught up because I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t even have a Twitter account that I can follow what he\u2019s tweeting, so my staff usually has to print his tweets out and hand them to me. (Laughter.) Now, on the one hand, you can say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s nuts. Why don\u2019t you get an account?\u201d But on the other hand, I\u2019ve actually concluded that\u2019s not a bad system because it goes out and I don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to go out, so there\u2019s not a whole lot I\u2019m going to do until it\u2019s out there. By the time I find out about it, there\u2019s actually been some period of time, and dependent on where I am in the world it might be five minutes or it might be an hour before somebody hands me a piece of paper and says, \u201cHey, the President just tweeted this out.\u201d There \u2013 I already have the early reactions to that and it allows me to now begin to think about, all right, how do we take that then into \u2013 if it\u2019s a foreign policy issue, is it \u2013 what is it he\u2019s tweeting about, how do we take that and now use it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\u2019s interesting. I get the question a lot from people about, gosh, it must be impossible to deal with that. I had to get used to it early on because it was very unconventional for all of us. But I take it and I say, okay, this is information. Let\u2019s \u2013 we know what our objectives are and he didn\u2019t change any of them. This is just his way of wanting to communicate on the subject. How do we take that and use it? And so that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s how I deal with it, but I think I\u2019m probably going to go to my grave and never have a social media account. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> I was really struck when you talked about Syria and you talked about the way forward in Syria, leaving aside the military side, which obviously there have been some real gains, particularly in clearing ISIS from Iraq and now a leg up, at least, on ISIS in Syria. But I was struck that when you turned to political stabilization, you used a few words that most people would not associate with the Trump administration. I want to have you talk a little bit about that. You talked about values, America\u2019s values. You talked about human rights. You talked about the need for the Syrian people to be able to express themselves in free elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe would consider those parts of the values agenda, if you will, because going really all the way back to Woodrow Wilson, American presidents have believed that the internal composition of states actually does matter. And I think you\u2019ve made a very good case that one of the reasons that we face the problem that we face in Syria is that Bashar al-Assad is a dictator who has murdered his own people and oppressed his own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so pull back from Syria and talk about how, after now almost a year on the job, you see the issue of values, human rights, democracy in the \u2013 in American foreign policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve \u2013 as an engineer, I guess I\u2019ve had a hard time describing to others how I view it. Our American values of freedom, respect for the individual, human dignity \u2013 all of the manifestations of the values that define who we are as a people, who we are collectively as a group of people who have aligned ourselves around these values and defines how we treat one another every day \u2013 how you take that into the foreign policy arena.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd at one level, these are values that are enduring, and what I\u2019ve said to people is you know with foreign policy if you \u2013 when you take the values and you try to put them into foreign policy, the concern I\u2019ve always had is policies can change and adjust, and they do. And so how do you \u2013 if you\u2019re doing that, your values never change. They never adjust. So our values are with us at all interactions always.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, how do you operationalize \u2013 and I\u2019ll use that word \u2013 how do you operationalize the values? Because I think that\u2019s getting to the heart of the question. And Syria is a great case study in my opinion of that. Going into Syria and advocating human rights, religious freedoms, women\u2019s equal participation in the midst of literally thousands of people and civilians being killed every day doesn\u2019t resonate very well, because the most important human right to anybody is our first one: the right to life. Life, then liberty, then the pursuit of happiness. And that\u2019s the way I think about our values. I first have to keep people from being killed, and if I can keep them from being killed and if we can create areas of stability, then we begin to create the seeds of liberty, and then we create the pathway to a pursuit of happiness. And underneath all of that are, then, the articulation of our respect for the human dignity, the human condition, all the ways that we express these values that are uniquely American values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it really is how do you create the conditions so people can actually achieve that, and the priority in Syria right now is stop people from being killed. They\u2019re being killed. They\u2019re being killed by the thousands. Stop that, stabilize it, start creating some conditions, and then we can begin to promote respect for people\u2019s religious freedoms, respect for their dignity. And so it is very much \u2013 in my mind it\u2019s \u2013 and being an engineer, this is the way I think it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s a process inside of a system, and at any point in time and depending on the country\u2019s condition, the location, the circumstances, we\u2019re going to be at a different place in that process. If we have a stable \u2013 a stable government that is repressive of certain religious organizations, then we go right at that. Because it\u2019s not that people are being killed, but they\u2019re being persecuted; they\u2019re being denied their own pursuit of happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it \u2013 very much, I think in each situation, I look at it and say, what is the priority here? And the first priority is always the protection of life \u2013 stop people from being killed. And if you do that, you begin to create the conditions where we can truly lean forward and advocate on the values themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>And the tools for doing the kind of work that you\u2019re talking about, obviously when you\u2019ve stabilized a situation, you still have to have the diplomacy, you still have to have the assistance to people. There have been concerns about the commitment to, say, foreign assistance and to having those tools that American diplomats rely on to bring stability. Jim Mattis apparently famously said that if he doesn\u2019t have foreign assistance, he\u2019s going to need more bullets, just to paraphrase.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, a couple of American foreign assistance efforts that have been just universally appreciated: PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which probably, through the efforts of President Bush and then President Obama, saved millions of people from a pandemic; and then the Millennium Challenge, which tries to take foreign assistance and give it to states that are actually going to use it wisely, that are not corrupt. Can you talk a little bit about the future of those programs? And I know you\u2019re an advocate for them. How are you doing inside the administration and on the Hill?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, you picked two of the easiest to defend, because PEPFAR is broadly viewed, within the administration even, as like the gold standard of success. It has produced extraordinary results and it has demonstrated it really uses the American dollar wisely. For dollar invested, if you think about it as an investment, it\u2019s a dollar invested for the return \u2013 PEPFAR, by any measure you want to examine it, has been wildly successful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the Millennium Challenge Corporation, similarly, has been wildly successful because of the disciplined process it uses. I think the debate that goes on more is not about those kinds of programs, but about a lot of other assistance programs that may not have the kind of structure around them that PEPFAR has or the kind of structure around them \u2013 and accountability to go with structure \u2013 that the Millennium Challenge has, and a view that America is, has been, and still is today the most generous nation on planet Earth when it comes to humanitarian assistance, disaster relief. We are always first and foremost.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut if you look at the situation with the nation\u2019s finances, and we all know about the deficits that we\u2019re building up all the time, I think the President has rightly asked the question of, okay, we know what we\u2019re doing; how\u2019s the rest of the world doing? And are you doing your share? And so that has become very much an overlay to how this administration thinks about all means of foreign assistance, from the kind of assistance that\u2019s provided through USAID and the State Department to foreign military sales and assistance, to international organizations at the UN and others. We will do our part, but we demand that others do their part as well. And so he has created very high expectations that we will go out and elicit others to step up and start contributing more on a proportionate basis with their ability to do so. And he famously points to a lot of nations around the world that are doing extraordinarily well. In many cases they\u2019re doing better than we are with our own economy, yet they\u2019re not carrying what in our view is their share of this need the world has.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo a lot of this last year and even the early part of this year is a lot of active engagement with countries around this issue. Having said that, there\u2019s no abandonment of our recognition of these needs. And as you know and through the budget process, the budget process involves our two branches of government, co-equal branches. The Congress has their say on it as well, and the administration has theirs. So a lot of this is, in the end, we resolve it through the budget negotiation process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I would say about the State Department budget in particular, because it got a lot of \u2013 it\u2019s gotten a lot of discussion, is I like to give people perspective. The State Department\u2019s budget is coming off of a record high \u2013 $55 billion, largest budget the State Department ever had, and a series of about the last five or six years of one record budget after another. And what I tell people, and having run another organization that had large numbers we had to deal with every day, it\u2019s very hard to execute \u2013 it\u2019s very hard for the State Department to execute a $55 billion budget. I mean, quite frankly, if you want to do it well and you want to be good stewards of the American hard-earned taxpayer dollar that you\u2019ve been given, we do need to be able to go out and do that well. And the truth of the matter is one of the reasons we\u2019re not struggling in 2017 is we had a lot of carry-forward money because no one could execute that size of a budget. And so there\u2019s a lot of money that\u2019s moving through.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo right now I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a dynamic situation where we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position of being unable to meet, we believe, the most critical needs out there. But it\u2019s coming and we\u2019re trying to plan ahead and we\u2019re trying to elicit more burden-sharing from others around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Thanks. One final question before we let you go. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask about where you started your remarks: North Korea. We\u2019ve got false alarms going off in Hawaii. We\u2019ve got people talking about war coming on the peninsula. At the same time, we\u2019ve got the North Koreans and the South Koreans deciding they\u2019re going to march together in the Olympics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDo you have a sense at all that the rhetoric that we\u2019ve used, the fact that perhaps the diplomacy is not as front and center as some of the talk about our military options, that we might be driving a wedge with our South Korean allies? I know when I was secretary and trying to do the Six-Party Negotiations, the North Koreans loved to drive a wedge to pick off the Chinese or pick off the South Koreans or pick off the Russians, and it was really important not for the United States to get isolated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how should we read these initiatives between the North and South? And tell us about the diplomacy, because I think we\u2019re all in agreement, nobody really wants war on the peninsula, on the Korean Peninsula, despite the seriousness of the North Korean threat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, our diplomacy efforts, which began really last February, the first week I was \u2013 after I was sworn in, I was with the President in the Oval and the very first foreign policy challenge that he gave me was he said you\u2019ve got to develop a foreign policy approach to North Korea. And so we did and we worked that through the interagency process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd what we \u2013 I labeled it the peaceful pressure campaign; the President has since relabeled it the maximum pressure campaign. But it is \u2013 and I know people say, \u201cAh, we\u2019ve tried sanctions in the past. They never work.\u201d We\u2019ve never had a sanctions regime that is as comprehensive as this one, and we\u2019ve never had Chinese support for sanctions like we\u2019re getting now. Russia is a slightly different issue. But the Chinese have leaned in hard on the North Koreans to the point \u2013 part of this approach was to help the Chinese come to the realizations that North Korea for the last 50, 60 years may have been an asset to you; they\u2019re now a liability to you. And I mean, it\u2019s because of how events can play out on the Korean Peninsula. If China doesn\u2019t help us solve this problem, there are a lot of follow-on effects, and China is well aware of those.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think the diplomatic efforts are about unifying the international community around this sanctions campaign, which has been extraordinarily effective. As President Moon himself told us on the phone call \u2013 and I would tell you, we have probably \u2013 the level of communication that goes on between ourselves, South Korea, and China on this issue is pretty extraordinary. People would probably be surprised at how often we are on the phone with one another a week talking about this. Moon said the reason the South Koreans came to us was because they are feeling the bite of these sanctions. And we\u2019re seeing it in some of the intel, we\u2019re seeing it through anecdotal evidence coming out of defectors that are escaping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Japanese made a comment yesterday in our session that they have had over 100 North Korean fishing boats that have drifted into Japanese waters \u2013 two-thirds of the people on those boats have died \u2013 they weren\u2019t trying to escape \u2013 and the ones that didn\u2019t die, they wanted to go back home. So they sent them back to North Korea. But what they learned is they\u2019re being sent out in the wintertime to fish because there\u2019s food shortages, and they\u2019re being sent out to fish with inadequate fuel to get back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re getting a lot of evidence that these sanctions are really starting to hurt. And so the rapprochement of the North to the South, now they\u2019re on to the playbook that you know as well as anyone. And the playbook is, okay, we\u2019re going to start our charm offensive to the rest of the world and let them see we\u2019re just normal people like everybody else. We\u2019re going to engender some sympathy. We\u2019re going to try to drive a wedge between South Korea and their allies. And we spent an extraordinary amount of time yesterday in the group discussion hearing from Foreign Minister Kang of South Korea about how they\u2019re not going to let that happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we understand what this is about, and we\u2019ve been supportive of this rapprochement, because the other element of the diplomacy is we\u2019ve been waiting for Kim to decide he wants to talk. We\u2019ve been very clear, and our channels are open. And as I said yesterday in my press avail, he knows how to reach me if he wants to talk. But he\u2019s got to tell me he wants to talk. We\u2019re not going to chase him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this may be their early effort to break the ice; we\u2019ll see. Nothing may come of it, but \u2013 we are supportive of that, but I would tell you that among the allies in the region, but equally with China, I don\u2019t think we have ever been as unified against this threat. Because China knows the potential consequences of this, to unintended consequences that could come later. And in diplomacy, where you\u2019re dealing with someone across the table like this, and when we get to that negotiating table \u2013 and I\u2019m confident we will \u2013 I want to know that Secretary Mattis has a very, very strong military option standing behind me. That will give me a better position from which to try to solve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs Secretary Mattis and I told our Chinese counterparts when we were across the table from one another in a security and strategic dialogue, I said to my counterpart, Yang Jiechi \u2013 I said, \u201cState Councilor, if you and I don\u2019t solve this, these guys get to fight, and we don\u2019t want that. And neither do you.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we are highly motivated. It is a long process. It\u2019s taken a lot of patience. We\u2019ll see. But we are committed, as is everyone in the international community, to a denuclearized North Korea. And we\u2019re going to stay on that until we achieve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> Thank you very much, and all the best. We certainly hope you succeed. Thank you very much.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s background call to preview the Secretary\u2019s upcoming trip to Texas, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and also Jamaica. Today we\u2019re joined by [Senior State Department Official One], who will be referred to as Senior State Department Official One. We\u2019re also joined by [Senior State Department Official Two], who will be referred to as Senior State Department Official Two. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is on background; it\u2019ll be embargoed until the end of the call. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And with that, I will turn it over to our senior State Department officials for opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take a few questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Thanks, [Moderator], very much. The Secretary is planning to leave on February 1st, and he will actually depart for Austin, Texas from the Greenbrier, which is in West Virginia, where he\u2019ll be giving a speech that morning. He will then speak to a group at the University of Texas of approximately 250 people, and he\u2019ll be greeted and hosted by the university president, Gregory Fenves. It\u2019s the Secretary\u2019s alma mater, so he\u2019s looking forward to returning. That speech should last about an hour. It\u2019ll be in the early afternoon. It\u2019ll be open. It\u2019ll be streamed on Facebook and all other vehicles. And there will be a Q&amp;A after the speech, and that Q&amp;A will be open to other questions, and so there might be questions relating to Latin America, which is what the speech will be about, but then there will \u2013 could also be questions relating to other countries in the world, and he\u2019ll be happy to answer those too.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>He\u2019ll then leave mid-afternoon and will go to Mexico City. And that evening, he\u2019s meeting with Mexican Government leaders at the ambassador\u2019s residence. And he\u2019ll stay overnight in \u2013 will stay overnight in Mexico City. And that morning, they\u2019ll \u2013 he\u2019ll meet with chiefs of missions. This is where the Secretary of State brings together chiefs of missions from certain countries and is able to talk to them in an informal setting about how things are going within their nation and listen to any concerns they have or anything they need from the Secretary. So at this particular chief of mission conference will be chiefs of missions from Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Belize, and the Caribbean. That\u2019s in the morning. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then later that day, late morning, he meets with the \u2013 Videgaray, the foreign minister. And then there\u2019ll be a joint press avail after that sometime before noon. And then some time in the early afternoon, he\u2019s going to meet with President Pena Nieto. And around mid-afternoon, probably around 3 o\u2019clock or so, he\u2019ll probably go to the Zocalo, or the Metropolitan Cathedral, although that is not definite.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then later that day, will fly to Panama City, so just \u2013 where there\u2019ll be refueling, and then he\u2019ll immediately go on to Bariloche in Argentina, arriving on Saturday morning. That day will then start around noon, where he\u2019ll go to \u2013 is expected to go to the Nahuel Huapi National Park. And right now, he\u2019s expected to ascend the summit on horseback, but there will also be a chairlift for those people that \u2013 reporters and others that want to go on the chairlift and film him coming up on the horseback, or who don\u2019t want to go on horseback. It will be your choice. And that takes care of that afternoon.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Sunday, it\u2019s Bariloche to Buenos Aires. So he\u2019ll arrive at Buenos Aires sometime closer to around noon. There\u2019ll be a wreath-laying at Saint Martin Plaza \u2013 at Saint Martin Palace, I\u2019m sorry, with the foreign minister. Then a meeting with the foreign minister and key cabinet ministers. There\u2019ll be a joint press avail sometime around 2:00, and then he\u2019ll meet that afternoon with chiefs of missions from that part of the world, and that would include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia. He is planning to meet the Panama ambassador when he \u2013 when the plane lands in Panama City.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The \u2013 there\u2019ll be a mission personnel meeting that afternoon, and then that evening is the Super Bowl, which he, along with many other people, will be watching. The next day he\u2019ll meet with President Macri in the morning. And then late morning, he\u2019ll leave Buenos Aires for Lima, when he \u2013 arriving in Lima around 2:00, where he\u2019ll meet with the foreign minister, Aljovin. There\u2019ll be a press avail for that. There\u2019ll be a meeting with the ambassador, the American ambassador to Peru, and that will take care of that evening. That \u2013 all that should take until around 6 o\u2019clock or so.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Tuesday he meets with the president of Peru, President Kuczynski, and will leave late morning to Bogota, where that afternoon he\u2019ll meet with the ambassador and then sometime around 4:00 meet with the president of Colombia, President Santos. There\u2019ll be a joint press avail, and then later after that he\u2019ll meet with the foreign minister, Holguin. That evening there\u2019s an informal working dinner with President Santos.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Wednesday morning he flies to Kingston, Jamaica. He\u2019ll meet with the prime minister, Holness, and Foreign Minister Johnson-Smith. And there\u2019ll be an expanded meeting after that, so basically a 20-minute meeting first and then another meeting. And then later that day he\u2019ll meet with the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the embassy, and will then fly back to Washington, landing somewhere around 7 to 8 o\u2019clock.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And I\u2019d like to introduce [Senior State Department Official Two], who can give you some more color relating to the purpose of the trip and why we\u2019ve chosen those particular countries.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. Secretary Tillerson\u2019s going to be making \u2013 embarking on his first multi-country trip to Latin America and the Caribbean this week. It\u2019s appropriate, as there are some very important events occurring in this hemisphere where U.S. leadership will be on display. There\u2019s the Summit of the Americas in Peru in April; in June, the G7 summit will take place in Canada; and later in the year, at the end of November, Argentina will host the G20 summit for the first time in South America. U.S. leadership will be on display as we work with our Latin American partners throughout the region.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary is engaging with regional partners on this trip to promote a safe, prosperous, energy-secure, and democratic hemisphere. We stand with the region as a steady, enduring partner. We\u2019re working hand in hand with partners to disrupt the transnational criminal organizations and trafficking routes that harm our hemisphere\u2019s citizens and drive illegal migration. The United States trades twice as much with this hemisphere as we do with China, and we will continue to enhance our trade and energy relationships to foster prosperity for our region. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We remain steadfast in our shared respect for democracy and human rights. The Secretary will continue to advocate for increased regional attention to the multiple crises in Venezuela. With our partners, we plan to continue to pressure the corrupt Maduro regime to return to democratic order.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With that, I\u2019ll stop and take questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> For our first question we\u2019ll go to <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> and the line of Tracy Wilkinson. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. How are you? Thank you for doing this. Gosh, I have a gazillion questions. Let\u2019s start with \u2013 [Senior State Department Official One], did you say that the Secretary will be meeting with Venezuelan officials in that meeting in Buenos Aires, or did I hear wrong?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> I \u2013 well, not officials, the \u2013 he\u2019s definitely not meeting with Venezuelan officials.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> I think he was talking about there will be a chief of mission conference --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I see. Okay. So a U.S. official from \u2013 who is stationed in --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Yeah, and our charg\u00e9 will --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Right. So when I mentioned --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Got it.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> -- all those countries, those are American charg\u00e9s -- charg\u00e9</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, that was my confusion. Okay, got it. Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>All right, so on \u2013 let\u2019s start with Colombia. There has been a lot of concern and talk on the \u2013 in Congress about the surge in coca production. Is this something you\u2019re going to be \u2013 or the Secretary will be raising with President Santos, and do you \u2013 is the position of this government, this administration, of you guys that the peace process has facilitated coca production, which is what some people claim?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then on Mexico, I know there\u2019s a lot of concern that the NAFTA talks could spoil other cooperation between Mexico and the United States in terms of immigration and drug trafficking and all of those things. So what will the Secretary\u2019s message be to Mexico vis-a-vis those talks? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> On Colombia, the Secretary absolutely is going to discuss the surge in coca production and cocaine production, but he\u2019s also going to note how we continue to work in close collaboration with the Colombian Government and its security forces to combat this problem of drug trafficking as it affects Colombia, as it affects the entire hemisphere, and the threat it poses to the United States. So we will most certainly raise that in Colombia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With regard to the question of NAFTA in Mexico, the Secretary\u2019s visit will once again underscore that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is deep and broad. He will talk about our joint efforts against transnational criminal organizations. He will underscore how our two governments are cooperating to prevent illegal migration from reaching our southwest border and how we\u2019re working together to address the underlying conditions that are prompting illegal migration from Central America through our joint efforts in Central America and in the Northern Triangle countries.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Next question, Nora Gamez from the <i>Miami Herald</i>.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Your line is now open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, hi, hello. Thank you for doing this. Senator Marco Rubio has sent a letter to the President asking to impose sanctions against Diosdado Cabello, and I wonder if State Department support that position, like imposing sanctions against Cabello.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And a quick question on Cuba: Will the Secretary Tillerson be addressing the situation in Cuba on his trip?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> The State Department, in line with the White House, will use all economic, political, and diplomatic tools at our disposal to address the situation in Venezuela. The upcoming undemocratic transition of political authority in Cuba is likely to be raised at multiple stops throughout the Secretary\u2019s trip.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Next question, please. Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit more about the intent of the Secretary\u2019s visit to Bariloche? What \u2013 aside from the visit to the national park, what message is he trying to send by visiting Bariloche and what does he hope to achieve there?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Well, very importantly, he\u2019s going to be meeting there with people who run the national park but also a Fulbright scholar. He\u2019s going to be talking about the kinds of scientific and research exchanges that are going on between the two countries. And at the national park, he will underscore how conservation at the park is advancing important goals as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Rafael Bernal from The Hill.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thank you for having this. With the chiefs of mission talk in Mexico City, you mentioned El Salvador and Honduras are going to be there. I wanted to know if the Secretary will address questions related to TPS. And on that question, I know Senator Cardin is holding up the OAS ambassador subject to the State Department releasing the documents that went from the embassy to State and then to DHS. Do you plan to release those to the Senate? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Yeah. We\u2019re aware of the senator\u2019s request. I will have to get with our Legislative Affairs bureau to get a fuller answer to that question. But Temporary Protective Status is a Department of Homeland Security decision ultimately. There\u2019s no doubt that in our meeting with our ambassadors from that group, we will internally discuss the challenges and the opportunities that the TPS decision presents to our partners in the hemisphere.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> All right, thank you. Luis Alonso from AP. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Good morning for doing this. I would like to ask \u2013 well, it\u2019s a two-part question. First, the \u2013 it\u2019s the first multi-country trip to Latin America by the Secretary after he\u2019s been a full year in the job. Is \u2013 how the region should be reading the fact that it took him a year to visit several countries in the region?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And the second part of the question is specifically about Venezuela. There are some reports in the Spanish-language press saying that Secretary Tillerson may use this trip to the region to sound out regional leaders on a possible U.S. oil embargo against Venezuela. And also, now that I\u2019m at this, is the U.S. \u2013 does the U.S. have a preference on whether Peru, as the host of the summit, should invite or should not invite Venezuela to the summit? Thank you very much.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the Secretary\u2019s priority and attention towards \u2013 towards the Western Hemisphere began with his first bilateral trip abroad, which was to Mexico. And I think this trip builds on his engagement in the Western Hemisphere throughout the past year, and the meetings he\u2019s had here in Washington with different leaders demonstrates that he has been engaged, and this trip will allow him to deepen and broaden those relationships. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Regarding the Summit of the Americas, we look forward to participating in that summit. The summit\u2019s theme of democratic governance in anti-corruption efforts will allow us to underscore and highlight the corrupt practices that are occurring in Venezuela under the Maduro regime. President Maduro, if invited and if he attends, will have to answer to the rest of the democratic nations of this hemisphere while he has pursued \u2013 why he has pursued illegitimate elections over the last year, and we would look forward to that discussion.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Last question, is that what you\u2019re saying, or another one? Okay. Maria Molina with Radio Colombia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi. I wanted to ask you if there is a further strategy from the U.S. apart from the sanctions to Venezuela, because right now, apparently, they are not seeming to be really, really effective. So I wanted to ask if there \u2013 if you were thinking about a further strategy not related to sanctions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> Our strategy on Venezuela has been extremely effective. Over the last year, we sanctioned more than 50 individuals. The Lima Group has joined this effort and created an additional hemispheric pressure entity on Caracas. The Canadian Government has also sanctioned individuals in Venezuela, and just last week, the European Union joined the international pressure campaign to hold individuals who are violating human rights in Venezuela, who are responsible for antidemocratic practices and who are robbing the national treasury of the country, by imposing their own international sanctions. The pressure campaign is working. The financial sanctions we have placed on the Venezuelan Government has forced it to begin becoming in default, both on sovereign and PDVSA, its oil company\u2019s, debt. And what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the Maduro regime is a total economic collapse in Venezuela. So our policy is working, our strategy is working and we\u2019re going to keep it on the Venezuelans. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> And our final question, Christina Garcia from EFC.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thank you for having this call. I just want to confirm that the \u2013 Secretary Tillerson is going to the Summit of the Americas, and also, is President Trump also going? Thank you so much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> The Summit of the Americas invitations are due out in the next couple of weeks, and we will make decisions on the \u2013 the U.S. Government participation at that time. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. And any final comments that anyone want to wrap up with here? [Senior State Department Official One]? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIORE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> No, I think it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing you on the trip.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> And I just \u2013 I just also want to underscore in talking about our sanctions. They are targeted at the responsible \u2013 members of the regime in Venezuela. And it\u2019s really important that our financial sectors are targeted at the placement of additional debt by the Venezuelan Government. Not a single corn \u2013 ear of corn \u2013 not a single medicine container, not anything that could help the Venezuelan people is blocked by our sanctions. Our goal is to help the Venezuelan people deal with this economic crisis, but also restore democratic order so that they can be in charge of their future again. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you so much, sir. Thanks, everybody. The embargo will now be lifted, and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

On Venezuela, you may have seen yesterday that I issued a statement on Venezuela, and I want to reiterate that the United States strongly rejects the call by Venezuela\u2019s illegitimate Constituent Assembly for snap presidential elections before April 30th. The vote would neither be free nor fair; it would only deepen, not help resolve national tensions.

Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis will co-chair the opening session of the dialogue jointly with our Qatari counterparts, Deputy Prime Minister \u2013 excuse me, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister al-Thani and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for State of Defense al-Attiyah \u2013 pardon me. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019re pleased to host the senior Qatari officials at an event that reaffirms our close ties and commitments to cultivating a strategic relationship with the state of Qatar. They\u2019re a strategic partner and we seek to use this dialogue to deepen our collaboration with them. We look forward to discussing many important areas of cooperation between our countries, including trade, investment, defense, security, law enforcement, counterterrorism, and also aviation. We also talk about the critical regional issues of defeating ISIS, the ongoing Gulf disputes, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then in terms of the Secretary today, as you all know, he is at Davos accompanying the President as part of the U.S. delegation. When the Secretary travels with the President, he pretty much follows the President\u2019s schedule, so he was a part of some of the President\u2019s meetings today, including with Benjamin Netanyahu. The Secretary also held a meeting today with Nechirvan Barzani and also with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq. This evening \u2013 excuse me, that takes place this evening.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN:</b> Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Has that happened already? That happened already, okay. So I don\u2019t have the details or any readouts of those meetings, but I know you probably saw what the \u2013 or heard what the Secretary said going into his meeting with Barzani earlier. The Secretary will remain in Davos tonight before he heads to Warsaw tomorrow afternoon. In Poland, he\u2019ll meet with senior Polish officials to discuss the range of issues in the strong U.S.-Poland bilateral relationship, including global challenges, regional security, and also economic prosperity. He will also participate \u2013 the Secretary will \u2013 in a wreath-laying ceremony Sunday \u2013 excuse me, Saturday marks the \u2013 is it the 75th anniversary of --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN:</b> Seventy-third.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Pardon me?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN:</b> Seventy-third. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Seventy-third anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. And so he is going to be there to mark that day. Let\u2019s see.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>(Off-mike.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I believe \u2013 no, no, no. It\u2019s --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MR GREENAN: </b>It will be in --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>-- at a \u2013 it\u2019s a memorial, right? Is it \u2013 yeah. Let me look at our detailed scheduled here that I think has some additional information on it. He\u2019ll be at the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>This is \u2013 but the wreath he\u2019s laying is to the people who died in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, right? It\u2019s not specifically related to Auschwitz? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know that Saturday marks that day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Okay.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>So I believe it was \u2013 yes, both. Because you wouldn\u2019t go just commemorate Auschwitz without acknowledging what had happened in Warsaw as well. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary will also meet with mission personnel before heading back to the U.S. Okay. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got for that --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Question about --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b> Yeah. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Middle East.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>-- aid to the Palestinians. President Trump said that aid is now on the table for everything. What are you telling the Palestinians? Is this all U.S. aid is now under review? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>You saw our position on UNRWA. The President has now spoken. He made his comments, so I\u2019m not going to speak for the President, but --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>But this is beyond UNRWA, this is --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>-- bilateral aid.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Right, right.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Does that mean that you guys are reviewing all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians and that --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>-- it\u2019s dependent on peace talks?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think there are a lot of things under review. I know the President sees \u2013 and I can\u2019t speak for the President, but the President sees that nothing has happened with regard to the peace process over many decades. And they\u2019re looking for ways to get people back to the table and get people back to peace talks. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>The U.S. Government has given the Palestinian Authority aid to support its security forces for many years and part of that has been an effort to help them prevent attacks on Israelis. Is that under review too?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m not aware of that. I can check on that and get back to you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Heather, has --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Heather, the President mentioned that \u2013 possibly cutting off aid in the same sentence that he mentioned the Palestinians disrespecting Vice President Pence by not letting him visit. Is slighting of the Vice President one of the factors the U.S. is taking into consideration as it reviews future aid to the Palestinians? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m not going to speak on behalf of the President, so I\u2019m going to let his comments stand for themselves, but one of the things that we are doing is looking for ways to kind of shake things up a bit, to try to get both sides to come back to the table. And we look forward to trying to facilitate any kind of peace talks.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Can I ask you on UNRWA? You mentioned that UNRWA needs to be reformed. Has this administration given UNRWA a specific list of demands of the things that it wants to see reformed?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>We have spoken with representatives from UNRWA. We\u2019ve also spoken with other countries about the need to get other countries to provide more money and resources for UNRWA. We\u2019re pleased some countries have stepped up. Belgium is one of those countries that has; there are some others as well. So we\u2019re pleased that other countries recognize that they\u2019re \u2013 other countries need to do more. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In terms of the first part of your question, have we given specifics to UNRWA? Yes. Some of those are just \u2013 we consider to be more private diplomatic type conversations, but we have made clear to them the need to reform their funding mechanism, for example. The Secretary has spoken about this here at the State Department where he said, look, every year at the end of the year there is an emergency appeal for money. The system and the structure shouldn\u2019t be set up in such a way that every year they are running out of money and need to plead for emergency funds. So it\u2019s just not a sustainable program the way the funding mechanism is currently set up, and so we are promoting for UNRWA to develop a funding mechanism structure that is better sustaining. So that would be one of the examples, and we could -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Could you talk a little bit about why you \u2013 why you think that by cutting these funds for economic development programs, humanitarian aid, why that will do anything other than make people more hungry and angry and frustrated and drawn to radicalism?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I\u2019m just going to go back to what the President said before. And I\u2019m not quoting him, but in general we have seen a lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process for many, many decades \u2013 more decades than some of you have been alive. And so there needs to be a new way to try to get people back to the table, and perhaps this is one way that it can encourage and will encourage both sides to eventually return to the peace process.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Are you blaming only the Palestinians or primarily the Palestinians -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> -- for that situation recently?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we\u2019ve talked to both the Israelis and we\u2019ve certainly made clear to the Palestinian \u2013 Palestinians in the past that both sides need to come to the table, and that it\u2019s not going to be easy. Both sides will have to compromise.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> The President --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And you\u2019re quite clear that the Israelis are ready to come to the table?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think they are. I think they are. They\u2019ve indicated that in the recent past, so I don\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard or seen anything that would indicate otherwise.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> The President again stressed repeatedly today that he\u2019s taken Jerusalem off the table. Now that\u2019s done, that issue is done, he kept saying. Is Jerusalem off the table for negotiations?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>In what way?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Whether or not \u2013 I mean, the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as their future capital. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> That would be -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So is that off the table for the Palestinians?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>That would be a final status negotiation that would have to be determined by the Israelis and the Palestinians. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But he says he\u2019s taken it off the table.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think \u2013 and I can\u2019t parse the President\u2019s words. I\u2019m not in the position to do so. I think you all recognize that. But I think what the President was referring to at the time \u2013 if you go back and look at the time in which that was said, I think he was referring to \u2013 saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel from a U.S. perspective. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But he also said that the Israelis will have to pay for that in future talks. He said that again today.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Well, then I\u2019d have to refer you to the White House on that, because I can\u2019t speak for the President and I wasn\u2019t there as part of the comments.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Just to be clear \u2013 because the two things seem to have overlapped a bit in this discussion \u2013 the withholding of the money to UNRWA is to get UNRWA reformed?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Reformed, yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> It has nothing to do with whether the Palestinians come to the negotiating table?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>That is correct. Yes. And we have --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So what the President is talking about today is different aid?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes. I think he\u2019s talking about aid in general. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Okay?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So can I ask why --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And why does the State Department --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Do you guys want to stick on Israeli-Palestinian stuff? Because I\u2019m going to have to go quickly. Is that \u2013 do you want to talk about other things?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can I have a quick one on Turkey about yesterday\u2019s phone call between President Trump and Erdogan?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> It seems that the Turks are telling \u2013 claiming there is a mischaracterization of the content of the call in the White House readout. What do you make of this claim from Turkey?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think our \u2013 the call readout that was provided by the White House was very specific, it was very detailed, and it was firm. And I think it expressed both the President and the Secretary\u2019s extreme concern about the situation in northwestern Syria, in the Afrin area. So I think they were clear about that. I think the President and the Secretary \u2013 as the Secretary has in recent calls with the foreign minister of Turkey \u2013 been very clear that we want a de-escalation of tensions. This is a part of Syria that had been relatively stable. Again, it\u2019s Syria, but it had been relatively stable. And now we\u2019re <span><span><span>seeing something altogether different happen. We recognize and respect Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns, their concerns about the PKK. Turkey is a NATO partner and ally, so we understand and respect that, but I want to make something clear, that we don\u2019t have a U.S. presence in Afrin. Our U.S. presence is elsewhere. It\u2019s more in the eastern part of the country, where we\u2019ve been fighting \u2013 where we have been fighting ISIS. So we\u2019re not a part of that. We work with the Syrian Democratic Forces in the eastern part of that country to fight ISIS. We continue to do that, so \u2013 and we encourage the Turks and everybody else to put the focus on ISIS and not other groups.</span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Heather, the Turkish foreign minister and other Turkish officials said publicly that Tillerson proposed this idea for a 30-kilometer buffer zone. Tillerson said, \u201cI didn\u2019t propose anything.\u201d The Turks have come back and said no, really, you did. Do you have any clarity on \u2013 I mean, did they discuss it but it wasn\u2019t a formal proposal, or \u2013 can you, like, parse that for us?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>Yeah, and we put out some comments on this yesterday, and I want to talk a little bit about some of what the Secretary said. And he talked to I believe one of the pool reporters today when he landed in Davos. He said, \u201cWe discussed a number of possible options, but we didn\u2019t propose anything.\u201d So back to the readout for a second that was provided, we stand by the readout. We stand by the President\u2019s assertion of cautioning Turkey about the escalation of tensions in the Afrin area, and then the Secretary I think has also been clear by saying, look, we discussed a range of options with the Turks.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Was the 30-mile or kilometer buffer zone one of them?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I don\u2019t have that level of specificity that I can provide to you, but I think there was no formal proposal of anything. I think the Secretary was talking with Turkey \u2013 NATO ally \u2013 about hey, what do you all need, just as though he would talk to the Kurds, because he was speaking with Barzani today. So he\u2019s talking with both sides about what they would all need.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> The Turks are talking \u2013 you were saying that you\u2019re not involved in Afrin, but they\u2019re talking about moving on to Manbij, which \u2013 where there is a U.S. military base. Has the Secretary kind of drawn any red lines about where they can go?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>We have been clear with the Turks.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Have we relocated any U.S. personnel out of Manbij to make sure they don\u2019t get bombed by the Turks?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>State Department personnel?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Or U.S.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I \u2013 yeah, I can\u2019t comment on any DOD personnel because I just wouldn\u2019t have that level of knowledge, but I\u2019m not aware of any State Department personnel who\u2019ve been moved.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Can you explain what you mean \u2013 what \u2013 that Tillerson has been clear? Because Michele asked you whether he\u2019d drawn any red lines if they move to Manbij. What \u2013 when you say that Tillerson\u2019s been clear, clear about what?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>We\u2019ve been clear with \u2013 and some of these conversations I just can\u2019t get into that level of specificity, but we\u2019ve been very clear with the Turkish Government, Turkish officials both on the ground in Turkey and in the Secretary\u2019s private conversations with the foreign minister, as well as with President Trump\u2019s conversations with President Erdogan, that we do not want to see an escalation of tensions in any way, shape, or form. And part of that would of course include the town, the community of Manbij.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Right, but the \u2013 but in terms of any U.S. action if the \u2013 because the U.S. troops are there.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I\u2019m not going to go forward with what we may or may not do, but all of them have made it clear that that would be an area that would be of major concern.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> And what is your level of confidence that the Turks are hearing those messages?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re putting those messages out. We certainly hope that they will listen. As a NATO partner and ally, we think they should. We think that that would be a good thing. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not the only country that has this concern about an escalation of tensions. </span></span></span>There are many other partners and allies who are equally concerned about instability in Syria and taking the eye off of ISIS.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Would you say that the Turks have given assurances of any kind, or how would you characterize --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> I would not say that they\u2019ve given assurances. We\u2019re following this very closely. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Quick one on Burma/Myanmar.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have anything to say with regard to former Secretary Richardson\u2019s comments from yesterday beyond what you said yesterday? And secondly, were his comments in any way whatsoever coordinated with the State Department or the Trump administration?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> No, they were not coordinated with the administration. They were not. I can tell you that we share his concern. You all read his letter. It was very frank. He was not operating under the auspices of the U.S. Government. He was over there as a private citizen. And I think it was certainly a good opportunity, and we were certainly hopeful that he was named to that commission, but I\u2019ll let his words speak for themselves about what he felt \u2013 how he felt that commission was going.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And what makes you think that the criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi is going to strengthen either her ability or her will to try to do some of the things that you would like seen done in Burma?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we didn\u2019t put out that statement. That was put out by Ambassador Richardson.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But you said, \u201cWe share his concerns.\u201d</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we share his concern. Yeah, absolutely.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Right, right. So by that, I take it as kind of an endorsement with what he said. You share the concerns that he has, so --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, let me back up, then, because I can\u2019t endorse his actual words because he\u2019s not operating on behalf of the U.S. Government. But certainly it is a concerning situation and certainly we would like to see the advisory commission be able to help the situation there.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> What I don\u2019t get is why starting to be more explicit in criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi will necessarily help her or make her any more inclined to push the country in the direction that you would like against the wishes of the military, which still basically have more power under their constitution than she does. So -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> As you know, we\u2019ve had a series of conversations with the government there, both with Aung San Suu Kyi and also General Min. Those conversations are ongoing with the government in general. Our people on the ground, Ambassador Scot Marciel is very involved in this. So we continue to have those conversations. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We would eventually like to see the Rohingya be able to go home in a safe and voluntary fashion. We don\u2019t believe that it would be safe or voluntary if they were to be sent home right now. We\u2019re continuing to monitor that situation. It is a tremendous concern of the United States Government. We have put a lot of money, a lot of taxpayer dollars, into assisting the Rohingya both in Bangladesh and in Burma as well. So it remains a concern. We certainly note what Ambassador Richardson said about his concerns and why he says he\u2019s pulling out of the commission panel.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t think that undermines Aung San Suu Kyi?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, that was his \u2013 it was his choice. It was certainly his choice because he had concerns about the way that the advisory panel was running. And so I\u2019d just refer you back to his comments about that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, one of their tension points that both he has discussed and Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman has said is that he wanted to address the fate of these Reuters journalists who were actually there specifically investigating what happened to the Rohingya, and that the position of Myanmar\u2019s Government is these are completely unrelated because this is a press freedom thing, this is a Rohingya thing. Is it the position of the United States that the fate of those journalists is completely untethered from the Rohingya crisis?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve stated whether it\u2019s tied to it or it\u2019s not. It\u2019s certainly related. It\u2019s certainly related to democratic reforms that we would like to see take place in that country. I mean, we consistently call for greater press access to allow press to go out and report the facts. And one of our major concerns about the situation in the Northern Rakhine State is that reporters \u2013 and frankly, aid groups to some extent \u2013 have not been able to get in to report what\u2019s going on on the ground. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So I don\u2019t have the specifics of the reporters\u2019 case. I mean, I\u2019ve read reports, but I can\u2019t personally confirm what exactly the reporters were doing there. But if they were just out reporting the facts, and reporting the reality and the situation on the ground, that deserves to be shared with the world.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019re going to have to get going in a few minutes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> India is hosting \u2013 this time I\u2019ll go on.

She was recently there within the past few days or so. But I don\u2019t have anything on \u2013 for you on that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Last one, Heather?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And \u2013 and on Pakistan, Pakistan has said that any unilateral action from the U.S. \u2013 they were referring in terms of a drone attack yesterday \u2013 would be detrimental to the U.S.-Pakistan cooperation. How do you see their statement?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I don\u2019t have any comment on that story you\u2019re referring to.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think that some of that would be DOD.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can I ask really quickly do you have a readout of Susan Thornton\u2019s meetings in Asia?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I do not. Her trip is still ongoing, so we hope to get a readout for you all upon her return if we\u2019re able to do that. I can tell you she was in Indonesia, she was in Mongolia, and she was in China. Big topic, of course, regional issues and the DPRK and our maximum pressure campaign.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have any sense what Susan \u2013 what kind of reception Susan had in Beijing and what the Chinese reaction was to what was decided in Vancouver?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know she talked about the DPRK and our maximum pressure campaign. And we consistently ask for China to do more. That\u2019s one of the things with the regard to putting pressure on the DPRK, that\u2019s one of the things that she did address with them, of course.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, but they were pretty critical of this Vancouver meeting coming up. They said they didn\u2019t think it would accomplish much. And I was wondering if she had any indication they warmed up to what was discussed there, and what was the efforts?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know we\u2019ll keep pushing and keep talking to the Chinese Government and ask them to apply maximum pressure along with us. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, is the Secretary upset that USAID has suspended their participation in the overhaul?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I haven\u2019t asked him that question. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s aware of that particular report.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can you \u2013 can you \u2013 do you have anything more to say about that, about whether \u2013 I mean is AID cooperating with his redesign, or how\u2019s it going?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t know the status of that.

Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n<p>\n\tWell, good morning. And I really, really appreciate this opportunity to swing down to Stanford while I was out on the West Coast and particularly to address this group. And I want to thank Stanford and the Hoover Institution and the international studies group for allowing me to speak to you this morning. I have familiarity with the Hoover Institution; I\u2019ve spoken at some of their events in the past in my prior life, and it has consistently produced great, principled scholarship that makes the calls for representative government, private enterprise, and protecting the American way of life right at the center of your activities, and very important topics that we spend our time on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in that regard, you certainly have a true advocate in your ranks: my friend, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who \u2013 I don\u2019t know if she takes responsibility for this situation she got me into or not, but I \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I hold her partially accountable anyway. And \u2013 but I appreciate Condi\u2019s advice and counsel. When you arrive at the Secretary of State\u2019s desk, I was looking for the how-to manual; there wasn\u2019t one there. So she\u2019s been a great source of help and inspiration to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I also want to acknowledge the other co-host, one of our nation\u2019s most dedicated and gifted public servants, certainly of the 20th century: former Secretary George Shultz. And George and I have known each other a long time as well, and I\u2019m a great admirer of his work as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ve just come from a ministerial meeting in Vancouver, in which a number of nations discussed how to better implement our maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. The United States and our allies are and continue to be united in continuing this campaign until North Korea takes meaningful steps toward denuclearization. We all agreed \u2013 all of us \u2013 that we will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom Vancouver I made a quick swing down here to California. And I appreciated Dr. Rice\u2019s help in arranging this for me on somewhat short notice. There are some people back in Washington that are suspicious I\u2019m escaping the bad weather today to just come down here, but I am delighted to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe topic and the subject of my remarks today is to talk with you about the way forward for the United States in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m going to start by giving you a kind of a broad historical and political context for what are some very difficult situations facing the Syrian people, and they raise concerns for all of the international powers as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen I want to describe why it is crucial to our national defense to maintain a military and diplomatic presence in Syria, to help bring an end to that conflict, and assist the Syrian people as they chart a course to achieve a new political future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then lastly, I want to detail the steps this administration is taking to achieve a stable, unified, and independent Syria, free of terrorist threats and free of weapons of mass destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen, as indicated, Dr. Rice and I will have a little conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor nearly 50 years, the Syrian people have suffered under the dictatorship of Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar al-Assad. The nature of the Assad regime, like that of its sponsor Iran, is malignant. It has promoted state terror. It has empowered groups that kill American soldiers, such as al-Qaida. It has backed Hizballah and Hamas. And it has violently suppressed political opposition. Bashar al-Assad\u2019s grand strategy, to the extent he has one beyond his own survival, includes hosting some of the most radical terrorist elements in the region and using them to destabilize his neighbors. Assad\u2019s regime is corrupt, and his methods of governance and economic development have increasingly excluded certain ethnic and religious groups. His human rights record is notorious the world over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSuch oppression cannot persist forever. And over the years, latent anger built up within the country, and many Syrians rose up and opposed Assad\u2019s rule. Within the days of what began as peaceful demonstrations that swept Syria in 2011, Assad and his regime responded to his own people with bullets and jail sentences.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSince that time, the story of Syria has been one of a humanitarian catastrophe. Up to half a million Syrians have died. Over 5.4 million Syrians are refugees, and 6.1 million are internally displaced persons, or IDPs. And as a result of conflict between regime and opposition forces, whole cities have been destroyed. It will take years to rebuild an entire nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPrevious American efforts to halt the conflict have been ineffective. When Assad used chemical weapons on his own people in 2013, in defiance of an American red line threat to retaliate, U.S. inaction emboldened the regime to further disregard civilian lives. In April of last year, the Trump administration responded to Assad\u2019s use of sarin nerve agent on civilians with cruise missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of Assad\u2019s air force. We did this to degrade the Syrian military\u2019s ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks, to protect innocent civilians, and to dissuade the Syrian regime from further use or proliferation of chemical weapons. The United States takes chemical weapons threats seriously, and we cannot stand idly by and allow their use to become regularized. We will continue to seek accountability and justice for the victims of that attack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2012, the Assad regime military forces began to struggle badly against armed opposition. The regime was soon bolstered through the assistance of Iranian-backed fighting forces. But despite this help, by August of 2015, Syrian rebel forces had made substantial progress against Assad\u2019s regime. Fearing for his own survival, Assad then appealed to Russia, his longtime ally, for help. Russia intervened to save the regime, largely by providing increased air power, intelligence, and arms support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn December of 2016, the key city of Aleppo fell to the regime after a brutal campaign that essentially destroyed that city, which had a population over two million people before the war. This symbolized the regime\u2019s ruthless determination to regain momentum in the conflict. It also led to \u2013 Assad to wrongly think that he would maintain power without addressing the Syrian regime\u2019s \u2013 the Syrian people\u2019s legitimate grievances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe civil war in Syria was horrific in and of itself. But Syria was thrown into an even greater state of turmoil with the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. This was an aspiring terror-state inside the borders of Iraq and Syria. The conflict between the regime and various opposition groups fighting to change Assad\u2019s grip on power created the conditions for the rapid expansion of ISIS in 2013 and 2014. ISIS originally emerged from the ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq, a group Assad had covertly backed. Evidence suggests Assad also abetted ISIS by releasing known terrorists from Syrian prisons and turning a blind eye to ISIS\u2019s growth. ISIS exploited the instability and lack of centralized authority in Syria to set up what it falsely claimed was a \u201ccaliphate,\u201d with the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital. Eventually, ISIS expanded to possess at its height a territory \u2013 an amount of territory roughly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom, and a significant fighting force. Flush with cash from looted banks and in control of oil fields in Syria and Iraq, ISIS had all the elements to sustain itself and carry out attacks on the U.S. homeland and those of our allies. The establishment of a radical terror-state attracted thousands of jihadists from over 100 countries, and motivated other terrorists around the world to commit attacks where they live.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the wake of the rise of ISIS, millions fled their homes, villages, and cities to escape the brutal regime\u2019s ethnic cleansing, resulting in massive refugee flows into the neighboring countries and as far as Europe and Scandinavia. By the middle of 2014, ISIS had a stable base of operations in Syria and significant revenue streams to fund, plan, inspire, and direct attacks against targets in the West and against our regional allies. It was using Syria to build chemical weapons for use against our partners. Recognizing the destructive power of a strengthening terrorist organization, America focused on a military defeat of ISIS. In spite of the threat ISIS posed in Syria, Assad focused instead on fighting the Syrian opposition, even with Iranian and Russian military support at his back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Trump administration\u2019s counterterrorism policy is quite simple. It is to protect Americans at home and abroad from attacks by terrorists. Central to this policy is to deny terrorist and terrorist organizations the opportunity to organize, raise money, recruit fighters, train, plan, and execute attacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen he took office, President Trump took decisive action to accelerate the gains that were being made in Syria and Iraq. He directed Secretary of Defense Mattis to present within 30 days a new plan for defeating ISIS. The President quickly approved that plan. He directed a pace of operations that would achieve decisive results quickly, delegating greater authority to American commanders in the field, and he gave our military leaders more freedom to determine and apply the tactics that would best lead to ISIS\u2019s defeat. Today, nearly all territory in Iraq and Syria once controlled by ISIS, or approximately 98 percent of all of that once United Kingdom-sized territory, has been liberated, and ISIS has not been able to regain one foot of that ground. ISIS\u2019s physical \u201ccaliphate\u201d of Raqqa is destroyed. The liberated capital of the caliphate no longer serves as a magnet for those hoping to build a terrorist empire. Approximately 3.2 million Syrians and 4.5 million Iraqis have been freed from the tyranny of ISIS. Over 3 million internally displaced Iraqis are now back home, and Mosul, the caliphate\u2019s second capital city in Iraq and one of Iraq\u2019s largest cities, is completely clear of ISIS. In Iraq, for the first time since the beginning of the crisis in December of 2013, there are more Iraqis going home than there are that are still displaced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we survey Syria today, we see the big picture, a situation characterized by principally three factors:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tISIS is substantially, but not completely defeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime controls about half of Syria\u2019s territory and its population.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd continued strategic threats to the U.S. from not just ISIS and al-Qaida, but from others persist. And this threat I\u2019m referring to is principally Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of its strategy to create a northern arch, stretching from Iran to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, Iran has dramatically strengthened its presence in Syria by deploying Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops; supporting Lebanese Hizballah; and importing proxy forces from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere. Through its position in Syria, Iran is positioning to continue attacking U.S. interests, our allies, and personnel in the region. It is spending billions of dollars a year to prop up Assad and wage proxy wars at the expense of supporting its own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, the unresolved plight of millions of Syrian refugees and IDPs remains a humanitarian crisis. The catastrophic state of affairs is directly related to the continued lack of security and legitimate governance in Syria itself. Assad has gassed his own people, he has barrel bombed entire villages and urban neighborhoods, and repeatedly undermined any chance for a peaceful resolution of political differences. Those abuses continue to this day, as seen in recent civilian casualties in East Ghouta and Idlib Governance<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>. There is no way to effectively facilitate a large-scale safe and voluntary return of refugees without a political solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn short, Syria remains a source of severe strategic threats, and a major challenge for our diplomacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the United States will continue to remain engaged as a means to protect our own national security interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States desires five key end states for Syria:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, ISIS and al-Qaida in Syria suffer an enduring defeat, do not present a threat to the homeland, and do not resurface in a new form; that Syria never again serves as a platform or safe haven for terrorists to organize, recruit, finance, train and carry out attacks on American citizens at home or abroad or against our allies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, the underlying conflict between the Syrian people and the Assad regime is resolved through a UN-led political process prescribed in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and a stable, unified, independent Syria, under post-Assad leadership, is functioning as a state.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iranian influence in Syria is diminished, their dreams of a northern arch are denied, and Syria\u2019s neighbors are secure from all threats emanating from Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFourth, conditions are created so that the refugees and IDPs can begin to safely and voluntarily return to Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd fifth, Syria is free of weapons of mass destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Trump administration is implementing a new strategy to achieve these end states. This process largely entails increased diplomatic action on the heels of our ongoing military successes. Our diplomatic efforts will be characterized by stabilization initiatives and a new emphasis on the political solution to the Syrian conflict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut let us be clear: The United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge. Our military mission in Syria will remain conditions-based. We cannot make the same mistakes that were made in 2011 when a premature departure from Iraq allowed al-Qaida in Iraq to survive and eventually morph into ISIS. It was that vacuum that allowed ISIS and other terrorist organizations to wreak havoc on the country. And it gave ISIS a safe haven to plan attacks against Americans and our allies. We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria. ISIS presently has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe understand that some Americans are skeptical of continued involvement in Syria and question the benefits of maintaining a presence in such a troubled country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHowever, it is vital for the United States to remain engaged in Syria for several reasons: Ungoverned spaces, especially in conflict zones, are breeding grounds for ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The fight against ISIS is not over. There are bands of ISIS fighters who are already beginning to wage an insurgency. We and our allies will hunt them down and kill them or capture them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, we must persist in Syria to thwart al-Qaida, which still has a substantial presence and base of operations in northwest Syria. As in the years before 9/11, al-Qaida is eager to create a sanctuary to plan and launch attacks on the West. Although ISIS is the terrorist group that has dominated the headlines most in the last few years, al-Qaida is still a grave threat and is looking to reconstitute in new and powerful ways.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, a total withdrawal of American personnel at this time would restore Assad and continue his brutal treatment against his own people. A murderer of his own people cannot generate the trust required for long-term stability. A stable, unified, and independent Syria ultimately requires post-Assad leadership in order to be successful. Continued U.S. presence to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS will also help pave the way for legitimate local civil authorities to exercise responsible governance of their liberated areas. The departure of Assad through the UN-led Geneva process will create the conditions for a durable peace within Syria and security along the borders for Syria\u2019s neighbors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tU.S. disengagement from Syria would provide Iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in Syria. As we have seen from Iran\u2019s proxy wars and public announcements, Iran seeks dominance in the Middle East and the destruction of our ally, Israel. As a destabilized nation and one bordering Israel, Syria presents an opportunity that Iran is all too eager to exploit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, consistent with our values, America has the opportunity to help a people which has suffered greatly. We must give Syrians a chance to return home and rebuild their lives. The safe and voluntary return of Syrian refugees serves the security interests of the United States, our allies, and our partners. To relieve the enormous pressure of refugee flows on the surrounding region and on Europe, conditions must be created for these refugees to safely and voluntarily return home. It will be impossible to ensure stability on one end of the Mediterranean, in Europe, if chaos and injustice prevail on the other end, in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, along with its allies and partners, will undertake the following steps to bring stability and peace to Syria:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, stabilization initiatives in liberated areas are essential to making sure that life can return to normal and ISIS does not re-emerge. Stabilization initiatives consist of essential measures such as clearing unexploded land mines left behind by ISIS, allowing hospitals to reopen, restoring water and electricity services, and getting boys and girls back in school. The approach has proved successful in Iraq, where millions of Iraqis have returned to their homes. In Syria, however, unlike in Iraq, we do not have a national government partner for stabilization efforts, so we must work with others. As such, there is a great deal of difficulty to them. Since May, the United States has deployed additional diplomats to the affected areas in Syria, working with the United Nations, our partners in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and various nongovernmental organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur work to help local and regional authorities provide services to liberated areas builds trust between local populations and local leaders who are returning. Terrorists thrive under conditions that allow them to peddle their warped and hateful messages to vulnerable people in conflict-stricken areas. Our stabilization efforts will help those people turn away from the prospect of terrorism and toward integration in their local communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe must be clear: \u201cStabilization\u201d is not a synonym for open-ended nation-building or a synonym for reconstruction. But it is essential. No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone. Our military presence is backed by State Department and USAID teams who are already working with local authorities to help liberated peoples stabilize their own communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimultaneous with stabilization efforts, de-escalating the overall conflict is also a critical step to creating the conditions for a post-Assad political settlement. Since July, the United States has worked with Russia and Jordan to establish the de-escalation area in the southwest part of Syria. It has achieved a ceasefire, ended indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations, and with some few exceptions, has thus far held up well. The agreement in the southwest also addresses Israel\u2019s security by requiring Iranian-backed militias, most notably Hizballah, to move away from Israel\u2019s border. We need Russia to continue to work with the United States and Jordan to enforce this de-escalation area. If it does, the resulting cessation of regime-opposition hostilities will allow for the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, create the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees, and provide the Syrian people the security to start rebuilding areas scarred by conflict. Our efforts have been \u2013 have helped refugees and IDPs return into the southwest de-escalation areas from where they had taken refuge in Jordan, and overall, an estimated 715,000 Syrians in total, including 50,000 Syrians from abroad, returned to their homes in 2017. These early but positive trends can increase through the continuation of de-escalation efforts not just in the southwest, but elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn counterterrorism, we will continue to work with allies and partners, such as Turkey, to address the terror threat in Idlib and address Turkey\u2019s concern with PKK terrorists elsewhere. Al-Qaida is attempting to re-establish a base of operation for itself in Idlib. We are actively developing the best option to neutralize this threat in conjunction with allies and partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is vigorously supporting UN efforts to achieve the political solution under UN Security Council Resolution 2254. This is the political framework for peace and stability in a unified Syria which has already been agreed upon by members of the UN Security Council. Specifically, we will work through what is known as the Geneva process, supporting UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime clearly looks to Russia as a guarantor of its security. Russia therefore has a meaningful role to play in persuading the Assad regime to engage constructively in the Geneva process. Beyond Russia\u2019s own vote to support UNSCR 2254, President Putin reaffirmed Russia\u2019s commitment to Geneva in his joint statement with President Trump issued from<span> Da Nang, Vietnam </span>last November. The United States and Russia have worked together on the southwest de-escalation area to success, and we have established deconfliction arrangements around the Euphrates River Valley to ensure the safety of our respective forces.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRussia must now follow through on the commitment our presidents made last November to find an ultimate solution through the UN-led Geneva process. One of the ways Russia can do that is to exert its unique leverage on the Syrian regime, which itself has agreed to participate in the Geneva process. Russia must put new levels of pressure on the regime to not just show up in Geneva but to credibly engage with the UN\u2019s efforts and implement agreed outcomes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, the EU, and regional partners will not provide international reconstruction assistance to any area under control of the Assad regime. We ask all stakeholders in Syria\u2019s future to do the same. We will discourage economic relationships between the Assad regime and any other country. Instead, we will encourage international assistance to rebuild areas the global coalition and its local partners have liberated from ISIS. Once Assad is gone from power, the United States will gladly encourage the normalization of economic relationships between Syria and other nations. The United States calls on all nations to exercise discipline in economically pressuring Assad and rebuilding Syria after a political transition. Our expectation is that the desire for a return to normal life and these tools of pressure will help rally the Syrian people and individuals within the regime to compel Assad to step aside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUNSCR 2254 also calls for UN-supervised free elections in Syria. The United States believes that free and transparent elections, to include the participation of the Syrian diaspora who have been displaced \u2013 all those who were forced to flee the conflict \u2013 will result in the permanent departure of Assad and his family from power. This process will take time, and we urge patience in the departure of Assad and the establishment of new leadership. Responsible change may not come as immediate as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform, UN-supervised elections \u2013 but that change will come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States recognizes and honors the great sacrifices the Syrian Democratic Forces have made in liberating Syrians from ISIS, but its victories on the battlefield do not solve the challenge of local governance and representation for people of eastern and northern Syria. Interim local political arrangements that give voice to all groups and ethnicities supportive of Syria\u2019s broader political transition must emerge with international support. Any interim arrangements must be truly representative and must not threaten any of Syria\u2019s neighboring states. Similarly, the voices of Syrians from these regions must be heard in Geneva and in the broader discussion about Syria\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn these points, the United States hears and takes seriously the concerns of our NATO ally Turkey. We recognize the humanitarian contributions and military sacrifices Turkey has made towards defeating ISIS, towards their support of millions of Syrian refugees, and stabilizing areas of Syria it has helped liberate. We must have Turkey\u2019s close cooperation in achieving a new future for Syria that ensures security for Syria\u2019s neighbors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, reducing and expelling malicious Iranian influence from Syria depends on a democratic Syria. For many years, Syria under Bashar al-Assad has been a client state of Iran. A Syrian central government that is not under the control of Assad will have new legitimacy to assert its authority over the country. The reassertion of national sovereignty by a new government, along with de-escalation efforts and new flows of international aid, will lower violence, set better conditions for stability, and speed up the departure of foreign fighters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize Syria presents many complexities. Our proposed solutions will not be easy to achieve. But it is necessary to proceed in these ways for the sake of our security and that of our allies. We will not repeat mistakes of the past in Iraq, nor will we repeat the mistakes made in Libya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell-intentioned military interventions independent of stabilization and political strategies give rise to a host of adverse, unintended consequences. For this reason, we seek to de-escalate the civil war in Syria, work for peace, and encourage all parties to head to the negotiating table. Continued fighting will likely lead to worsened humanitarian conditions, more chaos, and increased regional military intervention in Syria. Our focus is to build a positive political path forward that honors the will of the Syrian people and sustains the unity and territorial integrity of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs with almost all of our foreign policy challenges, the steps for achieving our objectives cannot be undertaken alone. We will continue to work closely with allies and partners. In suffering many terrorist attacks over the past few years, our allies in Europe have sadly experienced firsthand what groups like ISIS and al-Qaida are capable of. We need allies and partners to support our strategy in order to permanently mitigate the risk to security posed by these terrorist organizations and others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, the Syrian people have endured seven years of unimaginable chaos and hardship. They need help. A new course of action is a preferable alternative to more years of wishful thinking. A stable, unified, independent Syria will serve the national security interests of the United States, its allies, and our partners. If that reality can come to pass, it will be a victory for all, and it will support the ability of the Syrian people to pursue their own God-given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for your kind attention, and I look forward to our discussion. (Applause).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t</p><div style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-width:320px;\" class=\"small-12 medium-6 right\">\n<div style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n<iframe title=\"Brightcove Video\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; left: 0px;\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"//players.brightcove.net/1705665025/HJ8lQG1Eg_default/index.html?videoId=5713829891001\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar runVideo_7068842_pre = function() {\nif (typeof BrightcoveExperience == \"undefined\" && typeof embedded_plugin_status[2] == \"undefined\") {\nembedded_plugin_status[2]=1;\nembedded_plugin_Q[2] = new Array();\nembedded_plugin_Q[2].push(runVideo_7068842);\n $.getScript(\"/js/APIModules_all.js\", function(){\nembedded_plugin_status[2]=2;\nfor (i=0;i<embedded_plugin_Q[2].length;i++) {\nembedded_plugin_Q[2][i]();\n}\n});\n} else if(embedded_plugin_status[2] == 1) {\nembedded_plugin_Q[2].push(runVideo_7068842);\n} else if(embedded_plugin_status[2] == 2) {\nrunVideo_7068842();\n}\n}\nvar runVideo_7068842 = function() {\nbrightcove.createExperiences();\n}\nif (typeof brightcove == \"undefined\" && typeof embedded_plugin_status[1] == \"undefined\") {\nembedded_plugin_status[1]=1;\nembedded_plugin_Q[1] = new Array();\nembedded_plugin_Q[1].push(runVideo_7068842_pre);\n $.getScript(\"/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\", function(){\nembedded_plugin_status[1]=2;\nfor (i=0;i<embedded_plugin_Q[1].length;i++) {\nembedded_plugin_Q[1][i]();\n}\n});\n} else if(embedded_plugin_status[1] == 1) {\nembedded_plugin_Q[1].push(runVideo_7068842_pre);\n} else if(embedded_plugin_status[1] == 2) {\nrunVideo_7068842_pre();\n}\n</script>\n<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Well, thank you. Thank you very much for that comprehensive look at one of the most daunting problems that, I think, anyone in the international system has faced, and I\u2019d like to return to a couple of substantive issues, but I want to ask you a question first about being Secretary of State. It\u2019s kind of a hard job, isn\u2019t it? (Laughter.)\n\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>It\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s a little different. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> Yeah. (Laughter). So, when I was secretary, I\u2019d get up in the morning, and there were some things I\u2019d see on my calendar, and I\u2019d think, \u201cOh good, I\u2019m going to get to do that,\u201d and then there were some things that I\u2019d would think, \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll just go back to bed.\u201d What do you like about the job, and what do you find most challenging?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, what I like most about the job is what I\u2019ve always enjoyed throughout my career, and it\u2019s the quality of the people you have the privilege to work with every day. And what I\u2019ll say about the people in the State Department, the career people as well as the political appointees: These are extraordinarily dedicated individuals, some of the greatest patriots you\u2019ll meet anywhere, and they really come in every day with one objective in mind, and that\u2019s to carry out the foreign policy goals, objectives of the administration, but to serve the interests of the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what I look forward to every day is even if we\u2019re talking about really complicated issues, like the one I just described \u2013 and Syria is one of the most complex situations on the ground \u2013 the level of intelligence and the level of openness for us to have a good conversation about that is what I most look forward to. And I have a bullpen area \u2013 it used to be the Deputy Secretary of Management\u2019s office. I absconded it, and we have nothing but whiteboards in there, and I love going in the bullpen and just whiteboarding these exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat I least look forward to coming in to are those days when I have to deal with the loss of life. And whether it\u2019s the loss of a State Department person, or the loss of military personnel, or any American citizen anywhere, those are the days that are difficult, because you make calls to family members, you try to \u2013 people who have been taken hostage, you try to give their families reassurance, but those are the days that are really tough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Yeah. Now, as Secretary, you face some unique challenges as well. Social media was barely born when I was secretary. Thank God for that. And we know that your boss loves social media, so what\u2019s it like, and how do you deal with the constant pressure of social media, especially out of the White House?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, he\u2019s world class at social media and I\u2019m not \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and I want to confess here in the heart of the creation of this great technology, I have no social media accounts. I have never had any and I don\u2019t intend to have any. (Laughter.) It is a great tool when it\u2019s used well. The President has used it to great effect by bypassing the traditional means of communicating, and he absolutely thrives on this ability to instantly communicate not just to the American people, but to our friends and allies or to our adversaries, to the entire world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to do that because he \u2013 that is just the way the President operates. So the challenge is just getting caught up because I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t even have a Twitter account that I can follow what he\u2019s tweeting, so my staff usually has to print his tweets out and hand them to me. (Laughter.) Now, on the one hand, you can say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s nuts. Why don\u2019t you get an account?\u201d But on the other hand, I\u2019ve actually concluded that\u2019s not a bad system because it goes out and I don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to go out, so there\u2019s not a whole lot I\u2019m going to do until it\u2019s out there. By the time I find out about it, there\u2019s actually been some period of time, and dependent on where I am in the world it might be five minutes or it might be an hour before somebody hands me a piece of paper and says, \u201cHey, the President just tweeted this out.\u201d There \u2013 I already have the early reactions to that and it allows me to now begin to think about, all right, how do we take that then into \u2013 if it\u2019s a foreign policy issue, is it \u2013 what is it he\u2019s tweeting about, how do we take that and now use it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\u2019s interesting. I get the question a lot from people about, gosh, it must be impossible to deal with that. I had to get used to it early on because it was very unconventional for all of us. But I take it and I say, okay, this is information. Let\u2019s \u2013 we know what our objectives are and he didn\u2019t change any of them. This is just his way of wanting to communicate on the subject. How do we take that and use it? And so that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s how I deal with it, but I think I\u2019m probably going to go to my grave and never have a social media account. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> I was really struck when you talked about Syria and you talked about the way forward in Syria, leaving aside the military side, which obviously there have been some real gains, particularly in clearing ISIS from Iraq and now a leg up, at least, on ISIS in Syria. But I was struck that when you turned to political stabilization, you used a few words that most people would not associate with the Trump administration. I want to have you talk a little bit about that. You talked about values, America\u2019s values. You talked about human rights. You talked about the need for the Syrian people to be able to express themselves in free elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe would consider those parts of the values agenda, if you will, because going really all the way back to Woodrow Wilson, American presidents have believed that the internal composition of states actually does matter. And I think you\u2019ve made a very good case that one of the reasons that we face the problem that we face in Syria is that Bashar al-Assad is a dictator who has murdered his own people and oppressed his own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so pull back from Syria and talk about how, after now almost a year on the job, you see the issue of values, human rights, democracy in the \u2013 in American foreign policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve \u2013 as an engineer, I guess I\u2019ve had a hard time describing to others how I view it. Our American values of freedom, respect for the individual, human dignity \u2013 all of the manifestations of the values that define who we are as a people, who we are collectively as a group of people who have aligned ourselves around these values and defines how we treat one another every day \u2013 how you take that into the foreign policy arena.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd at one level, these are values that are enduring, and what I\u2019ve said to people is you know with foreign policy if you \u2013 when you take the values and you try to put them into foreign policy, the concern I\u2019ve always had is policies can change and adjust, and they do. And so how do you \u2013 if you\u2019re doing that, your values never change. They never adjust. So our values are with us at all interactions always.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, how do you operationalize \u2013 and I\u2019ll use that word \u2013 how do you operationalize the values? Because I think that\u2019s getting to the heart of the question. And Syria is a great case study in my opinion of that. Going into Syria and advocating human rights, religious freedoms, women\u2019s equal participation in the midst of literally thousands of people and civilians being killed every day doesn\u2019t resonate very well, because the most important human right to anybody is our first one: the right to life. Life, then liberty, then the pursuit of happiness. And that\u2019s the way I think about our values. I first have to keep people from being killed, and if I can keep them from being killed and if we can create areas of stability, then we begin to create the seeds of liberty, and then we create the pathway to a pursuit of happiness. And underneath all of that are, then, the articulation of our respect for the human dignity, the human condition, all the ways that we express these values that are uniquely American values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it really is how do you create the conditions so people can actually achieve that, and the priority in Syria right now is stop people from being killed. They\u2019re being killed. They\u2019re being killed by the thousands. Stop that, stabilize it, start creating some conditions, and then we can begin to promote respect for people\u2019s religious freedoms, respect for their dignity. And so it is very much \u2013 in my mind it\u2019s \u2013 and being an engineer, this is the way I think it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s a process inside of a system, and at any point in time and depending on the country\u2019s condition, the location, the circumstances, we\u2019re going to be at a different place in that process. If we have a stable \u2013 a stable government that is repressive of certain religious organizations, then we go right at that. Because it\u2019s not that people are being killed, but they\u2019re being persecuted; they\u2019re being denied their own pursuit of happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it \u2013 very much, I think in each situation, I look at it and say, what is the priority here? And the first priority is always the protection of life \u2013 stop people from being killed. And if you do that, you begin to create the conditions where we can truly lean forward and advocate on the values themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>And the tools for doing the kind of work that you\u2019re talking about, obviously when you\u2019ve stabilized a situation, you still have to have the diplomacy, you still have to have the assistance to people. There have been concerns about the commitment to, say, foreign assistance and to having those tools that American diplomats rely on to bring stability. Jim Mattis apparently famously said that if he doesn\u2019t have foreign assistance, he\u2019s going to need more bullets, just to paraphrase.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, a couple of American foreign assistance efforts that have been just universally appreciated: PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which probably, through the efforts of President Bush and then President Obama, saved millions of people from a pandemic; and then the Millennium Challenge, which tries to take foreign assistance and give it to states that are actually going to use it wisely, that are not corrupt. Can you talk a little bit about the future of those programs? And I know you\u2019re an advocate for them. How are you doing inside the administration and on the Hill?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, you picked two of the easiest to defend, because PEPFAR is broadly viewed, within the administration even, as like the gold standard of success. It has produced extraordinary results and it has demonstrated it really uses the American dollar wisely. For dollar invested, if you think about it as an investment, it\u2019s a dollar invested for the return \u2013 PEPFAR, by any measure you want to examine it, has been wildly successful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the Millennium Challenge Corporation, similarly, has been wildly successful because of the disciplined process it uses. I think the debate that goes on more is not about those kinds of programs, but about a lot of other assistance programs that may not have the kind of structure around them that PEPFAR has or the kind of structure around them \u2013 and accountability to go with structure \u2013 that the Millennium Challenge has, and a view that America is, has been, and still is today the most generous nation on planet Earth when it comes to humanitarian assistance, disaster relief. We are always first and foremost.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut if you look at the situation with the nation\u2019s finances, and we all know about the deficits that we\u2019re building up all the time, I think the President has rightly asked the question of, okay, we know what we\u2019re doing; how\u2019s the rest of the world doing? And are you doing your share? And so that has become very much an overlay to how this administration thinks about all means of foreign assistance, from the kind of assistance that\u2019s provided through USAID and the State Department to foreign military sales and assistance, to international organizations at the UN and others. We will do our part, but we demand that others do their part as well. And so he has created very high expectations that we will go out and elicit others to step up and start contributing more on a proportionate basis with their ability to do so. And he famously points to a lot of nations around the world that are doing extraordinarily well. In many cases they\u2019re doing better than we are with our own economy, yet they\u2019re not carrying what in our view is their share of this need the world has.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo a lot of this last year and even the early part of this year is a lot of active engagement with countries around this issue. Having said that, there\u2019s no abandonment of our recognition of these needs. And as you know and through the budget process, the budget process involves our two branches of government, co-equal branches. The Congress has their say on it as well, and the administration has theirs. So a lot of this is, in the end, we resolve it through the budget negotiation process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I would say about the State Department budget in particular, because it got a lot of \u2013 it\u2019s gotten a lot of discussion, is I like to give people perspective. The State Department\u2019s budget is coming off of a record high \u2013 $55 billion, largest budget the State Department ever had, and a series of about the last five or six years of one record budget after another. And what I tell people, and having run another organization that had large numbers we had to deal with every day, it\u2019s very hard to execute \u2013 it\u2019s very hard for the State Department to execute a $55 billion budget. I mean, quite frankly, if you want to do it well and you want to be good stewards of the American hard-earned taxpayer dollar that you\u2019ve been given, we do need to be able to go out and do that well. And the truth of the matter is one of the reasons we\u2019re not struggling in 2017 is we had a lot of carry-forward money because no one could execute that size of a budget. And so there\u2019s a lot of money that\u2019s moving through.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo right now I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a dynamic situation where we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position of being unable to meet, we believe, the most critical needs out there. But it\u2019s coming and we\u2019re trying to plan ahead and we\u2019re trying to elicit more burden-sharing from others around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Thanks. One final question before we let you go. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask about where you started your remarks: North Korea. We\u2019ve got false alarms going off in Hawaii. We\u2019ve got people talking about war coming on the peninsula. At the same time, we\u2019ve got the North Koreans and the South Koreans deciding they\u2019re going to march together in the Olympics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDo you have a sense at all that the rhetoric that we\u2019ve used, the fact that perhaps the diplomacy is not as front and center as some of the talk about our military options, that we might be driving a wedge with our South Korean allies? I know when I was secretary and trying to do the Six-Party Negotiations, the North Koreans loved to drive a wedge to pick off the Chinese or pick off the South Koreans or pick off the Russians, and it was really important not for the United States to get isolated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how should we read these initiatives between the North and South? And tell us about the diplomacy, because I think we\u2019re all in agreement, nobody really wants war on the peninsula, on the Korean Peninsula, despite the seriousness of the North Korean threat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, our diplomacy efforts, which began really last February, the first week I was \u2013 after I was sworn in, I was with the President in the Oval and the very first foreign policy challenge that he gave me was he said you\u2019ve got to develop a foreign policy approach to North Korea. And so we did and we worked that through the interagency process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd what we \u2013 I labeled it the peaceful pressure campaign; the President has since relabeled it the maximum pressure campaign. But it is \u2013 and I know people say, \u201cAh, we\u2019ve tried sanctions in the past. They never work.\u201d We\u2019ve never had a sanctions regime that is as comprehensive as this one, and we\u2019ve never had Chinese support for sanctions like we\u2019re getting now. Russia is a slightly different issue. But the Chinese have leaned in hard on the North Koreans to the point \u2013 part of this approach was to help the Chinese come to the realizations that North Korea for the last 50, 60 years may have been an asset to you; they\u2019re now a liability to you. And I mean, it\u2019s because of how events can play out on the Korean Peninsula. If China doesn\u2019t help us solve this problem, there are a lot of follow-on effects, and China is well aware of those.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think the diplomatic efforts are about unifying the international community around this sanctions campaign, which has been extraordinarily effective. As President Moon himself told us on the phone call \u2013 and I would tell you, we have probably \u2013 the level of communication that goes on between ourselves, South Korea, and China on this issue is pretty extraordinary. People would probably be surprised at how often we are on the phone with one another a week talking about this. Moon said the reason the South Koreans came to us was because they are feeling the bite of these sanctions. And we\u2019re seeing it in some of the intel, we\u2019re seeing it through anecdotal evidence coming out of defectors that are escaping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Japanese made a comment yesterday in our session that they have had over 100 North Korean fishing boats that have drifted into Japanese waters \u2013 two-thirds of the people on those boats have died \u2013 they weren\u2019t trying to escape \u2013 and the ones that didn\u2019t die, they wanted to go back home. So they sent them back to North Korea. But what they learned is they\u2019re being sent out in the wintertime to fish because there\u2019s food shortages, and they\u2019re being sent out to fish with inadequate fuel to get back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re getting a lot of evidence that these sanctions are really starting to hurt. And so the rapprochement of the North to the South, now they\u2019re on to the playbook that you know as well as anyone. And the playbook is, okay, we\u2019re going to start our charm offensive to the rest of the world and let them see we\u2019re just normal people like everybody else. We\u2019re going to engender some sympathy. We\u2019re going to try to drive a wedge between South Korea and their allies. And we spent an extraordinary amount of time yesterday in the group discussion hearing from Foreign Minister Kang of South Korea about how they\u2019re not going to let that happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we understand what this is about, and we\u2019ve been supportive of this rapprochement, because the other element of the diplomacy is we\u2019ve been waiting for Kim to decide he wants to talk. We\u2019ve been very clear, and our channels are open. And as I said yesterday in my press avail, he knows how to reach me if he wants to talk. But he\u2019s got to tell me he wants to talk. We\u2019re not going to chase him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this may be their early effort to break the ice; we\u2019ll see. Nothing may come of it, but \u2013 we are supportive of that, but I would tell you that among the allies in the region, but equally with China, I don\u2019t think we have ever been as unified against this threat. Because China knows the potential consequences of this, to unintended consequences that could come later. And in diplomacy, where you\u2019re dealing with someone across the table like this, and when we get to that negotiating table \u2013 and I\u2019m confident we will \u2013 I want to know that Secretary Mattis has a very, very strong military option standing behind me. That will give me a better position from which to try to solve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs Secretary Mattis and I told our Chinese counterparts when we were across the table from one another in a security and strategic dialogue, I said to my counterpart, Yang Jiechi \u2013 I said, \u201cState Councilor, if you and I don\u2019t solve this, these guys get to fight, and we don\u2019t want that. And neither do you.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we are highly motivated. It is a long process. It\u2019s taken a lot of patience. We\u2019ll see. But we are committed, as is everyone in the international community, to a denuclearized North Korea. And we\u2019re going to stay on that until we achieve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> Thank you very much, and all the best. We certainly hope you succeed. Thank you very much.

Why Iran? Is it because of the urgency or the importance of it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I think it\u2019s both. It\u2019s something that the President has viewed as a serious threat to Middle East stability and therefore to American national security and also looks at the place that the Iranian people find themselves, and he thinks it\u2019s a place America can help make a difference. He has long thought that the agreement that the previous administration entered into didn\u2019t serve any of those interests \u2013 the interests of the Iranian people or Middle East stability or, frankly, for America. And so it was a priority for him and thus I wanted in the first weeks since the Secretary of State to have an opportunity to lay out how President Trump thinks we can make things better in each of those three situations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What is the ultimate goal of the proposed new security framework, and how is it differ \u2013 how does it differ from the initial JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so very different. Different in breadth and I think different in its goal. The first agreement was very narrow. It was an effort to say that the Iranian regime was spending a ton of money on its nuclear program and it wanted to halt that \u2013 a noble objective, a good goal, a worthy one. But the threat that Iran presents is so much greater than that, right. They\u2019re taking \u2013 they\u2019re launching missiles into Muslim countries. They\u2019re taking the human rights away from their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these things I think President Trump cares deeply about, and so his vision is that if we begin again to set out what we think are pretty basic ideas, right. So these 12 things that I listed are all pretty straightforward. We\u2019re not asking a lot from the Iranian leadership, just behave like normal leaders; don\u2019t loot your people, don\u2019t waste your people\u2019s money on these adventures in Syria and Yemen and in Lebanon and in Iraq, the list goes on; lead your people, build a great nation, use the resources you have for that. That\u2019s all we\u2019re simply looking for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that going to be part of the new proposed security framework that Iran would stop or should stop meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so we\u2019ve asked for that. Look, we\u2019ve asked them to stop spreading terror around the world, not to build out militias in Iraq, not to put Iranian dollars and Iranian citizens, who are losing their lives in Syria \u2013 it\u2019s inappropriate for Middle East security and it\u2019s bad for the country. So our aim is to set conditions where Iran will behave like a normal nation, right. And if they do that, if they \u2013 and this is not the Iranian people. This is the Iranian leaders who have taken control and done this damage. If we can create conditions where they\u2019ll stop that, the Iranian people will have great success, and we will have Americans visiting there, and we\u2019ll have all the great things that we do when there are friends and allies as opposed to folks who are presenting risk to our country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I\u2019m going to get to the human rights issue also, sir. But if I may, I want to continue on the security framework if possible. How about a requirement for Iran to let inspections in the military sites? Is that going to be part of also the framework?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> So it is. With respect to the use of nuclear material in Iran, just as we have in Saudi Arabia, just as we did with the United Arab Emirates, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for Iran to have the capacity to create fissile material, to enrich uranium or have a plutonium facility. If they want a peaceful nuclear energy program, fine, but they could import that material. And other countries do it; it works for many countries around the world. And in order for us to achieve that, to get comfortable that that\u2019s the case, there will have to be inspections. That would include inspections at military sites and research laboratories and all the places that had been participants in previous iterations of Iran\u2019s program.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you mentioned human rights. There are protests, anti-government protests, all around Iran. I wanted to get your take on that. What do you \u2013 how do you feel about these protests? And do you think that United States can maybe support the protestors?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We can certainly provide moral support. I think importantly, the Iranian people will make these decisions for themselves. These protests have been ongoing now for months and months \u2013 some of them very small, some of them larger \u2013 often very much in sync with what I laid out this past week, their \u2013 how this wealth gets distributed to Qasem Soleimani and not the ordinary citizen in southeast Iran or in Tehran or wherever it might be. This wealth is being squandered so that ordinary Iranian citizens are both sending their young men off to fight and die and living lives that aren\u2019t as secure and as wealthy as they could be if Iran would simply change its behavior.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not about \u2013 you asked about regime change. It\u2019s not about changing the regime. It\u2019s about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people really want them to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it is what earlier John Bolton had said, that the goal of the administration is not regime change in Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> That\u2019s correct. Yes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And how do you feel about the opposition groups in the United States and in Europe? Do you support their efforts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yes. They should be \u2013 so long as they\u2019re working towards the same goal that we are. I\u2019ve seen from time to time that wasn\u2019t always the case with some of the groups, some of the smaller groups, frankly. So long as they\u2019re working towards the same thing. We don\u2019t want them advocating for regime change either. We want them working on behalf of the Iranian people, ordinary Iranian citizens who want nothing more than to live their lives, to be able to take their hijab off, to be able to go to work and raise their families and worship in the way they want to worship. This is for the Iranian people to do, and so if there are those on the outside who are working towards that goal, we certainly welcome it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, two years ago as a congressman you personally wanted to go to Iran, you were prepared to go to Iran, and you wanted to press the leadership \u2013 Khamenei and Zarif \u2013 to give you access to the American hostages. As Secretary, are you going to press the Iranian leadership again to free the American hostages? And as you know, Bob Levinson has disappeared more than 11 years ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I know the story of Mr. Levinson well. I pray for his safe return, and our team works for it every day. As for the other Americans, we hope that the Iranian leadership \u2013 Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, Ayatollah \u2013 all would see that it\u2019s in their best interests to \u2013 and for nothing more than basic humanity, to allow these innocent Americans to return to their families. There are big, big issues out there, but it seems pretty basic to me that one ought not hold innocent people from returning to their loved ones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo yes, we\u2019ll work on it. We\u2019ll pray for it. And we hope that one day, in the same way that we were blessed to have three Americans return from North Korea a few weeks past, we have that same kind of day for those that are being held by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I wanted to ask you about the chants, the slogans that we still hear inside Iran: \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d Before any type of agreement that Iran or Tehran and the United States would have about Iran, don\u2019t you think that it should be a requirement for Iran to stop that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, their leaders most especially. In America, people say all kinds of things. We have a wide-open democracy. There are people who like President Trump and who don\u2019t. I find that just fine. I am untroubled by that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen you have senior leaders, when you have others fomenting these sort of fake gatherings to do nothing but come after and talk \u2013 chant, \u201cDeath to America\u201d or \u201cDeath to Israel,\u201d the Iranian leadership ought to stop. They ought to stop that because it\u2019s not the right thing for their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think most Iranians \u2013 I think most Iranians look at what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish here in America and how blessed we\u2019ve been, and think that that\u2019s a model that works in the sense of we\u2019ll certainly adopt a different form of democracy, and we\u2019ll have a different form of government, and we\u2019ll have different values and beliefs across a certain set of things, we\u2019ll have different religions, and that \u2013 that\u2019s all fine. But the basic common understanding of humanity, that you treat every human being with dignity and respect, that you don\u2019t export violence around the world, that you don\u2019t steal and plunder from your people, those core values that are civilizational, they\u2019re historical \u2013 I think the Iranian people share those in the same way that the American people do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, I want to go back to something that you said, part of your speech. You stressed that \u2013 stressed, and you just mentioned it, that \u201cno more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats.\u201d What is your take on congressional efforts to expose the hidden wealth of the corrupt leaders of Iran, from Ayatollah Khamenei to the president? And if there is such a bill that would pass Congress, would the administration support this exposure?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We would. We think it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s just as important as an informational matter. The Iranian people deserve the truth. You have senior leaders that are pocketing money, using businesses that are nominally fronts, and frankly, just stealing. To the extent we can prove that and demonstrate that, I\u2019d welcome the chance to expose it so the Iranian people can judge for themselves whether these are the individuals they want to lead their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Thank you very much, ma\u2019am. It was great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We appreciate it very, very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

(Applause.) Welcome to the Heritage Foundation. My name is Kay James and I have the honor of being the president here. It is a pleasure and honor to welcome our distinguished guest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, back to Heritage. Yes, I said back. Some of you may remember that then-Congressman Pompeo spoke here on September 9th, 2015. His presence was appreciated, as his topic was timely. It was entitled \u201cA Pathway Forward: An Alternative to the Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal.\u201d And now we have the great pleasure of being with our friend in his new role as Secretary of State for the United States of America. It\u2019s not just a pleasure having him here; it\u2019s truly an honor that he chose Heritage as the site for his first public address as Secretary.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOur scholars here are dedicated to advancing individual freedom and national security, and his presence here is a wonderful affirmation of the positive impact that their work is having. And so to Secretary Pompeo, I\u2019d like to say thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, I imagine all who are in this room and watching online know a great deal about Secretary Pompeo, but please allow me to provide just a few highlights from his extraordinary career. Secretary Pompeo graduated first in his class at the United States military academy at West Point, and then served as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He also served with the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the U.S. Army\u2019s 4th Infantry Division. After leaving active duty, he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then had a successful private sector career, founding and serving as CEO of Thayer Aerospace and then becoming president of Sentry International.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo\u2019s public service began when he was elected representative of Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District, and his distinguished tenure on the Hill included service on the House Intelligence Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Select Benghazi Committee. Recognizing the Secretary\u2019s many talents, President Trump tapped him as director of the CIA, where he served from January 2017 to April 2018. And now, of course, he is our Secretary of State, having been sworn in just three and a half weeks ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast but, of course, never least, Secretary Pompeo is married to Susan Pompeo and has one son, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo, on behalf of the board of trustees, the staff, and all of the friends of the Heritage Foundation, welcome back to home. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the Heritage Foundation and its president, Kay Coles James. Thank you for hosting me today. First as a private citizen and then as a member of Congress, and even today, the Heritage Foundation has shaped my thinking on matters of the world and public policy issues. I\u2019m grateful for that excellent work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thanks for reminding me I can\u2019t talk about anything else but what we\u2019re talking about today. (Laughter.) Three years on. But it\u2019s an honor to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTwo weeks ago, President Trump terminated the United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump withdrew from the deal for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risk created by the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNo more. No more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats. No more acceptance of missiles landing in Riyadh and in the Golan Heights. No more cost-free expansions of Iranian power. No more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA put the world at risk because of its fatal flaws.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd they\u2019re worth recounting at some length today, if only for the purpose of ensuring that subsequent arrangements do not repeat them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, the weak sunset provisions of the JCPOA merely delayed the inevitable nuclear weapons capability of the Iranian regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfter the countdown clock ran out on the deal\u2019s sunset provisions, Iran would be free for a quick sprint to the bomb, setting off a potentially catastrophic arms race in the region. Indeed, the very brevity of the delay in the Iranian nuclear program itself incentivized Middle Eastern proliferation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMoreover, as we have seen from Israel\u2019s recent remarkable intelligence operation, Iran has lied for years about having had a nuclear weapons program. Iran entered into the JCPOA in bad faith. It is worth noting that even today, the regime continues to lie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told a Sunday morning news show, \u201cWe never wanted to produce a bomb.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis claim \u2013 this claim would be laughable if not for the willful deception behind it. Not only did the AMAD Program exist; the Iranians took great care \u2013 though, as we can see now, not enough care \u2013 to protect, hide, and preserve the work of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Mahabadi and his gang of nuclear scientists.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA had additional shortcomings as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal were simply not strong enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe deal did nothing to address Iran\u2019s continuing development of ballistic and cruise missiles, which could deliver nuclear warheads.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA permitted the Iranian regime to use the money from the JCPOA to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people, but the regime\u2019s leaders refused to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tInstead, the government spent its newfound treasure fueling proxy wars across the Middle East and lining the pockets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizballah, Hamas, and the Houthis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRemember: Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during the JCPOA. Qasem Soleimani has been playing with house money that has become blood money. Wealth created by the West has fueled his campaigns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrategically, the Obama administration made a bet that the deal would spur Iran to stop its rogue state actions and conform to international norms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat bet was a loser with massive repercussions for all of the people living in the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe idea of the JCPOA as a strategic pillar of stability in the Middle East was captured perfectly by John Kerry when he said, quote, \u201cI know the Middle East that is on fire \u2026 is going to be more manageable with this deal,\u201d end of quote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tQuery whether the Middle East is more manageable today than it was when they embarked on the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLebanon is an even more comfortable home for Hizballah today than it was when we embarked on the JCPOA. Hizballah is now armed to the teeth by Iran and has its sights set on Israel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to Iran, Hizballah provides the ground forces for the military expedition in Syria. The IRGC, too, has continued to pump thousands of fighters into Syria to prop up the murderous Assad regime and help make that country 71,000 square miles of kill zone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran perpetuates a conflict that has displaced more than 6 million Syrians inside the \u2013 6 million Syrians and caused over 5 million to seek refuge outside of its borders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese refugees include foreign fighters who have crossed into Europe and threatened terrorist attacks in those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, Iran sponsored Shia militia groups and terrorists to infiltrate and undermine the Iraqi Security Forces and jeopardize Iraq\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 all of this during the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Yemen, Iran\u2019s support for the Houthi militia fuels a conflict that continues to starve the Yemeni people and hold them under the threat of terror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe IRGC has also given Houthi missiles to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and to threaten international shipping in the Red Sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s support to the Taliban in the form of weapons and funding leads to further violence and hinders peace and stability for the Afghan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the Iranian Qods Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe should remember, too, that during the JCPOA Iran continues to hold Americans hostage: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and Bob Levinson, who has been missing for over 11 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI will note for the American people, you should know we are working diligently to bring each American missing wrongfully detained in Iran home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe list continues. Iran continues to be, during the JCPOA, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror. It continues to serve as sanctuary for al-Qaida, as it has done since 9/11, and remains unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members residing in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hizballah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaida? The United States believe you deserve better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have an additional point for the Iranian people to ponder. Here in the West, President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif are often held apart from the regime\u2019s unwise terrorist and malign behavior. They are treated somehow differently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe West says, \u201cBoy, if only they could control Ayatollah Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani then things would be great.\u201d Yet, Rouhani and Zarif are your elected leaders. Are they not the most responsible for your economic struggles? Are these two not responsible for wasting Iranian lives throughout the Middle East?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s worth the Iranian people considering, because instead of helping their own citizens, the regime continues to seek a corridor stretching from Iran\u2019s borders to the shores of the Mediterranean. Iran wants this corridor to transport fighters and an advanced weapons system to Israel\u2019s doorsteps. Indeed in recent months, the IRGC has flown an armed drone into Israeli airspace and launched salvos of rockets into the Golan Heights from Syria. Our steadfast ally has asserted the sovereign right of self-defense in response, a stance the United States will continue to unequivocally support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the bet \u2013 the bet that the JCPOA would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East, and indeed for the entire world. It is clear that the JCPOA has not ended Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, nor did it deter its quest for a regional hegemony. Iran\u2019s leaders saw the deal as the starting gun for the march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, the path forward. America\u2019s commitment to the Iran strategy President Trump laid down in October remains. It will now be executed outside of the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll continue to work with allies to counter the regime\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran\u2019s proliferation of missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten peace and stability. We will also ensure Iran has no path to a nuclear weapon \u2013 not now, not ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFollowing our withdrawal from the JCPOA, President Trump has asked me to achieve these goals on Iran. We\u2019ll pursue those goals along several lines of effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, we will apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime. The leaders in Tehran will have no doubt about our seriousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to our colleagues at the Department of Treasury, sanctions are going back in full effect and new ones are coming. Last week we imposed sanctions on the head of Iran\u2019s central bank and other entities that were funneling money to the IRGC Qods Force. They were also providing money to Hizballah and other terrorist organizations. The Iranian regime should know that this is just the beginning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis sting of sanctions will be painful if the regime does not change its course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen to one that rejoins the league of nations. These will indeed end up being the strongest sanctions in history when we are complete.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come in force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran will be forced to make a choice: either fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It will not have the resources to do both.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, I will work closely with the Department of Defense and our regional allies to deter Iranian aggression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe will ensure freedom of navigation on the waters in the region. We will work to prevent and counteract any Iranian malign cyber activity. We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hizballah proxies operating around the world and we will crush them. Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019d remind the leadership in Iran what President Trump said: If they restart their nuclear program, it will mean bigger problems \u2013 bigger problems than they\u2019d ever had before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, we will also advocate tirelessly for the Iranian people. The regime must improve how it treats its citizens. It must protect the human rights of every Iranian. It must cease wasting Iran\u2019s wealth abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe ask that our international partners continue to add their voice to ours in condemning Iran\u2019s treatment of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe protests \u2013 the protests of the past few months show that the Iranian people are deeply frustrated with their own government\u2019s failures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian economy is struggling as a result of bad Iranian decisions. Workers aren\u2019t getting paid, strikes are a daily occurrence, and the rial is plummeting. Youth unemployment is at a staggering 25 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGovernment mismanagement of Iran\u2019s natural resources has led to severe droughts and other environmental crises as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLook, these problems are compounded by enormous corruption inside of Iran, and the Iranian people can smell it. The protests last winter showed that many are angry at the regime that keeps for itself what the regime steals from its people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Iranians too are angry at a regime elite that commits hundreds of millions of dollars to military operations and terrorist groups abroad while the Iranian people cry out for a simple life with jobs and opportunity and with liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime\u2019s response to the protests has only exposed the country\u2019s leadership is running scared. Thousands have been jailed arbitrarily, and at least dozens have been killed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs seen from the hijab protests, the brutal men of the regime seem to be particularly terrified by Iranian women who are demanding their rights. As human beings with inherent dignity and inalienable rights, the women of Iran deserve the same freedoms that the men of Iran possess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut this is all on top of a well-documented terror and torture that the regime has inflicted for decades on those who dissent from the regime\u2019s ideology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime is going to ultimately have to look itself in the mirror. The Iranian people, especially its youth, are increasingly eager for economic, political, and social change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands with those longing for a country of economic opportunity, government transparency, fairness, and greater liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe hope, indeed we expect, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses and support \u2013 not suppress \u2013 the aspirations of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re open to new steps with not only our allies and partners, but with Iran as well. But only if Iran is willing to make major changes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs President Trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing, and able to negotiate a new deal. But the deal is not the objective. Our goal is to protect the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAny new agreement will make sure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and will deter the regime\u2019s malign behavior in a way that the JCPOA never could. We will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations, and we will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself. The Iranian wave of destruction in the region in just the last few years is proof that Iran\u2019s nuclear aspirations cannot be separated from the overall security picture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what should it be? We must begin to define what it is that we demand from Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, Iran must declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iran must also provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, each of them detained on spurious charges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must also end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring senior al-Qaida leaders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end the IRG Qods Force\u2019s support for terrorists and militant partners around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd too, Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors \u2013 many of whom are U.S. allies. This certainly includes its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also includes threats to international shipping and destructive \u2013 and destructive cyberattacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat list is pretty long, but if you take a look at it, these are 12 very basic requirements. The length of the list is simply a scope of the malign behavior of Iran. We didn\u2019t create the list, they did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom my conversations with European friends, I know that they broadly share these same views of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community. I ask that America\u2019s allies join us in calling for the Iranian Government to act more responsibly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn exchange for major changes in Iran, the United States is prepared to take actions which will benefit the Iranian people. These areas of action include a number of things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, once this is achieved, we\u2019re prepared to end the principal components of every one of our sanctions against the regime. We\u2019re happy at that point to re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relationships with Iran. And we\u2019re prepared to admit<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_edn1\" href=\"#_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Iran to have advanced technology. If Iran makes this fundamental strategic shift, we, too, are prepared to support the modernization and reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international economic system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut relief from our efforts will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran\u2019s policies. We acknowledge Iran\u2019s right to defend its people. But not its actions which jeopardize world\u2019s citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in contrast to the previous administration, we want to include Congress as a partner in this process. We want our efforts to have broad support with the American people and endure beyond the Trump Administration. A treaty would be our preferred way to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUnlike the JCPOA, which was broadly rejected across both sides of the aisle, an agreement that President Trump proposes would surely garner this type of widespread support from our elected leaders and the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the strategy we laid out today, we want the support of our most important allies and partners in the region and around the globe. Certainly our European friends, but much more than that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want the Australians, the Bahrainis, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Japanese, the Jordanians, the Kuwaitis, the Omanis, the Qataris, the Saudi Arabians, South Korea, the UAE, and many, many others worldwide to join in this effort against the Islamic Republic of Iran. I know that those countries share the same goals. They understand the challenge the same way that America does. Indeed, we welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation, and the brutality of a regime which is at odds with world peace, a country that continues to inflict chaos on innocent people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIndeed, while to some the changes in Iranian behavior we seek may seem unrealistic, we should recall that what we are pursuing was the global consensus before the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, in 2012, President Obama said, quote, \u201cThe deal we\u2019ll accept is [that] they end their nuclear program,\u201d end of quote. That didn\u2019t happen. In 2006, the P5 voted at the Security Council for Iran to immediately suspend all enrichment activities. That didn\u2019t happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2013, the French foreign minister said he was wary of being sucked into a, quote, \u201ccon game,\u201d end of quote, over allowing Iran to continue uranium enrichment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2015, John Kerry said, quote, \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize the right to enrich,\u201d end of quote. Yet the Iranians are enriching even as we sit here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re not asking anything other than that Iranian behavior be consistent with global norms, global norms widely recognized before the JCPOA. And we want to eliminate their capacity to threaten our world with those nuclear activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to its nuclear activities, why would we allow Iran more capability than we have permitted the United Arab Emirates and that we\u2019re asking for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? We understand that our reimposition of sanctions and the coming pressure campaign on the Iranian regime will pose financial and economic difficulties for a number of our friends. Indeed, it imposes economic challenges to America as well. These are markets our businesses would love to sell into as well. And we want to hear their concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account. Over the coming weeks, we will send teams of specialists to countries around the world to further explain administration policy, to discuss the implications of sanctions we imposition, and to listen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI know. I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time with our allies in my first three weeks. I know that they may decide to try and keep their old nuclear deal going with Tehran. That is certainly their decision to make. They know where we stand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNext year marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic \u2013 Revolution in Iran. At this milestone, we have to ask: What has the Iranian Revolution given to the Iranian people? The regime reaps a harvest of suffering and death in the Middle East at the expense of its own citizens. Iran\u2019s economy is stagnant and without direction and about to get worse. Its young people are withering under the weight of frustrated ambitions. They are longing to pursue the freedoms and opportunities of the 21st century.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran\u2019s leaders can change all of this if they choose to do so. Ali Khamenei has been supreme leader since 1989. He will not live forever, nor will the Iranian people abide the rigid rules of tyrants forever. For two generations, the Iranian regime has exacted a heavy toll on its own people and the world. The hard grip of repression is all that millions of Iranians have ever known.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow is the time for the supreme leader and the Iranian regime to summon the courage to do something historically beneficial for its own people, for this ancient and proud nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs for the United States, our eyes are clear as to the nature of this regime, but our ears are open to what may be possible. Unlike the previous administration, we are looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people, not just the regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf anyone, especially the leaders of Iran, doubts the President\u2019s sincerity or his vision, let them look at our diplomacy with North Korea. Our willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un underscores the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to diplomacy to help solve the greatest challenges, even with our staunchest adversaries. But that willingness, that willingness has been accompanied by a painful pressure campaign that reflects our commitment to resolve this challenge forever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo the ayatollah, to President Rouhani, and to other Iranian leaders: understand that your current activities will be met with steely resolve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy final message today is, in fact, to the Iranian people. I want to repeat President Trump\u2019s words from October. President Trump said that, \u201cWe stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime\u2019s longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. The Iranian people long to reclaim their country\u2019s proud history, its culture, its civilization, and its cooperation with its neighbors.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is America\u2019s hope that our labors toward peace and security will bear fruit for the long-suffering people of Iran. We long to see them prosper and flourish as in past decades and, indeed, as never before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the United States of America is proud to take a new course towards that objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES: </strong>Thank you so very much. Bold, concise, unambiguous. We appreciate you taking this forum here at the Heritage Foundation to deliver that message. Looking at \u2013 and you listed during your speech several of our allies and friends and partners, many of whom are angry, some disappointed. How are you going to bring them on board? How are you going to use your best diplomatic skills to bring them along with us?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> These strategic changes in the world come together when countries decide on an objective that is shared, and that always begins with a shared interest and values. I spent the first couple of weeks of my time as Secretary of State working to try to see if there wasn\u2019t a way to fix the deal. I spoke with my European counterparts. I traveled there. In my 13th hour as Secretary of State I was on the ground in Brussels speaking with my European counterparts. We couldn\u2019t get it done. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States intends to work hard at the diplomatic piece of working alongside all of our partners. We focus on the Europeans, but there are scores of countries around the world who share our concerns and are equally threatened by the Iranian regime. It\u2019s that shared interest, it\u2019s the value set which will ultimately drive, I believe, a global response to this \u2013 to the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror. I\u2019m convinced it can take place. My team is going to work diligently to do that. We\u2019re going to do so in the context of trying to address the concerns of all of our partners, and I am convinced that over a period of time there will be a broad recognition that the strategy that President Trump has laid out is the right one that will put Iran in a place where it will one day rejoin civilization in the way that we all hope that it will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> It\u2019s clear through your comments this morning that you truly want tough sanctions. And I think that there is some remaining concern about how are you going to deal with the nuclear concerns. Can you speak to that for just a bit? And let me say to our audience, by the way, that I wish we had more time with the Secretary this morning, and there will be an abrupt and a hard stop because we have to get him out to the CIA and \u2013 for the swearing-in ceremony, and we don\u2019t want you late for that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo talk to us about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I got to go back one more time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> One more time. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, the nuclear file is imperative. It presents the largest, most severe threat for sure. The JCPOA fell short. It was a delay. Our aim is to get that permanently fixed. I mentioned quickly, right, we ask our other Middle Eastern partners to do hard things. We put a 123 agreement in front of them and say, \u201cThis is what you have to do.\u201d And they say, \u201cHey, the Iranians enrich.\u201d That\u2019s reasonable. That seems to me a reasonable point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell, our demands on Iran aren\u2019t unreasonable. Give up your program. End it. Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we\u2019re fully prepared to respond to that as well. I\u2019m certainly not going to share with you today precisely what our response will be. But we watch them talk. We\u2019ve heard them say \u2013 I hope that they\u2019ll make a different decision, that they\u2019ll choose a different path. We welcome them taking a path that other nations in the region are beginning to take as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, can you explain for us the sanctions structure and how you intend to target the Iranian regime without hurting our European friends?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, any time sanctions are put in place, countries have to give up economic activity. So the Americans have given up economic activity now for an awfully long time, and I\u2019ll concede there are American companies who would love to do business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. There\u2019s a huge market there. It\u2019s a big, vibrant, wonderful peoples. But everyone is going to have to participate in this. Every country is going to have to understand that we cannot continue to create wealth for Qasem Soleimani.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRight, that\u2019s what this is. At the end of the day, this money has flowed to him. The economics have permitted them to run roughshod across the Middle East. Our effort is to strangle his economic capacity to do harm to the Middle East and to the world. Nuclear programs aren\u2019t cheap. To the extent we are effective at making it more difficult on the Iranian regime, we will reduce their capacity to continue to build out their nuclear weapon system as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> You\u2019ve laid out a very, very bold plan this morning. Do you have a timeframe for getting all this done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the sanctions are back in place and are winding down over the next 100 and what, 55 days? There are \u2013 there\u2019s lots more work in place. It is a effort across all of government. We are working certainly diplomatically in the lead, but Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, each of us has the same mission from President Trump. I can\u2019t put a timeline on it. But at the end of the day, the Iranian people will decide the timeline. At the end of the day, the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly, that would be wonderful. If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forward today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, Mr. Secretary, again, on behalf of the Heritage Foundation and the scholars here who have been working on these issues for a very long time, we want to thank you. Again, it was a bold vision \u2013 clear, concise, unambiguous \u2013 and we want to congratulate you and the President, and we wish you Godspeed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI am going to ask you to remain seated while the Secretary exits. I have about eight more questions here, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you all very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Thank you so much. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

We\u2019re very glad to host him here. We pay great attention to this visit because we\u2019re passing through a very critical timing in our bilateral relations, and therefore we do believe that this visit is of utmost importance.\n\n\n<p>\n\tTurkey and the United States of America have been continuing their strategic partnership over the course of the history, increasing its depth every day, and with the steps that have been taken on both sides, this strategic partnership has been extended into various spheres. And it does not just include the two countries, but in our region and beyond, it includes many countries as well as many states and many nations who are benefiting from this strategic partnership. The basis of this strategic partnership is actually the fight that we gave together in Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our past, we had some ups and downs in our relations. We even had times of crisis, but always and always, the strategic partnership vision was at the forefront in terms of its mid-term and long-term goals. When we started dialogue in a frank and sincere environment, we were able to overcome all these critical phases together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, like I have said, we are passing through such a critical stage in our relations. Yesterday, we were received by the president of the republic, and we had a trilateral meeting, and we had the same sincere and frank atmosphere where both sides expected \u2013 expressed their thoughts, their expectations, and even their worries in a most sincere and frank manner. And the meeting, which took about three hours, was not just a meeting that we discussed our bilateral relations, but also our cooperation in regional issues as well as our mutual perspectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I said before, our relations are at a critical turning point. We were either going to correct this and continue our relations or we were going to go into a much more worse position. But with the will that we put forward as of yesterday, we have taken an important turn in terms of normalizing our relations. We reached an agreement and an understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, there are certain steps that are needed to be taken to achieve this. There are expectations on both sides. We have certain worries about the Fethullahist terrorist organization and our fight against this FETO terrorist organization, and the support that is provided by the United States on YPG and similar organizations, and our expectations pertaining to PKK. Of course, these are very important security worries that are closely related to our existence, and we do want to believe that these are taken into consideration seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut up to this point, there were certain promises that were made, there were certain topics that we discussed, there were certain promises that were not kept, and there were certain issues that we could not resolve. So from this point on, we wanted to focus as to how we can take solution-oriented steps so that the issues are not just on paper, and we wanted to talk about how we can implement this, how we can make sure that they are implemented. So we were able to talk about all of these, and we decided to create a mechanism or even mechanisms to be able to discuss these and resolve them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne such mechanism, as you will see in the press declaration, is about the general issues: the consular issues, the issue regarding FETO, the Fethullahist terrorist organization, and some issues that the United States attaches importance to. Actually, we had a working group that we established after the visa crisis, but now we are going to extend the content of all of these and we will be talking about all of these together. For instance, on the FETO issue, do we have evidence or not? Do we need any additional evidence? Is the evidence that we have sent sufficient? Instead of discussing this in length before the public, we want to discuss this in the working \u2013 (break in audio) \u2013 because in order to reach any conclusion, any result, we need to work together and act together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Break in audio.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Syria issue, we also talked about how we are going to overcome our worries regarding the Syrian issue: which steps are we going to take, how are we going to fight against terrorist organizations, how are we going to establish stability in those cities that have been cleared of terrorist attacks, how \u2013 who is going to do this, how are we going to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq, and most importantly, how are we going to work together to achieve a political resolution with the Geneva process. So we were able to talk about how we will take concrete steps with our experts so we\u2019re not talking about promises or commitments any longer. We want to overcome all of these by working together, and I am sure that all of these will bring important results for us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll these mechanisms are not kicking the ball off to the corner. They are not delaying the process. To the contrary, these are important aspects to get results and mechanisms that will achieve results that will meet the expectations of both sides. So we are not trying to gain time, and hopefully, the next meeting is going to take place before the middle of March. We have agreed on this aspect as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the end, distinguished members of the press, the meetings that we had yesterday and today have been important in terms of the future of our bilateral relations, in terms of overcoming our mutual worries, and both on Syria, Iraq, and especially on the issue of the fight against terrorism. The cooperation with respect to regional issues were important, and this was a critical visit and a critical series of meetings. I do believe that once the relations are set into track again, what is important is as a result of all these visits and meetings to be able to take step towards the future jointly, commonly, in partnership, and get results. So we will work like two allies, establishing trust once again, and we will base our relations on this basis that have been strengthened by our partnership and alliance thoughts. With these opinions and thoughts, once again I would like to say welcome to our guest, Mr. Tillerson, and leave the floor to him, and then we will be answering questions from your side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, I want to thank Foreign Minister Cavusoglu for his hospitality during this visit, and I also want to express my appreciation to President Erdogan for the extensive amount of time he provided to me yesterday evening so we could have a very full discussion of both sides\u2019 concerns but also a lot of discussion about the future and how we go forward from where we are today. I want to reaffirm the deep and important relationship between the United States and Turkey. Ours is not an alliance of convenience or of temporary interest. It is a time-tested alliance built on common interest and mutual respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTurkey was one of the first countries to join NATO. Turkish troops served alongside Americans in Korea, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo. We have made many shared sacrifices together. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Turkey against terrorist threats. Turkey is a critical partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Daesh. We\u2019re grateful that Turkey has allowed the United States and other NATO countries to base forces in Incirlik, and Turkey is the linchpin of strategic stability at the crossroads of the three continents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur two countries share the same objectives in Syria: the defeat of ISIS, Daesh; secure and stable zones; an independent and unified Syria; and help chart a new democratic future for Syria under the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 process. We are hopeful that the Geneva process will produce a new constitution for the Syrian people and elections to be held under UN auspices. A democratic future for Syria is essential for preventing ISIS from re-emerging and from stopping the suffering that the Assad regime has inflicted on the Syrian people. The Turkish Government and people deserve the gratitude and recognition for the unprecedented hospitality they have displayed in hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize the legitimate right of Turkey to secure its borders. We take it seriously when our NATO ally Turkey says it has security concerns. As to Afrin, we call upon Turkey to show restraint in its operation to minimize the casualties to civilians and avoid actions that would escalate tensions in that area.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve been transparent with Turkey regarding our objectives in Syria. Our relationship with our NATO ally Turkey is enduring and strategic. I again conveyed this message to President Erdogan and to the foreign minister today, as have many other U.S. officials. We have always been clear with Turkey that the weapons provided to the Syrian Democratic Forces would be limited, mission-specific, and provided on an incremental basis to achieve military objectives only.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have long supported and will continue to support Turkish democracy. Respect for the rule of law, judicial independence, and an open press are a source of strength and stability. When Turkey maintains its commitment to these principles, it expands our potential partnership. We support the Government of Turkey\u2019s right to bring the perpetrators of the 2016 coup to justice. It is important to handle these cases in a transparent and fair manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. We continue to have serious concerns about the detention of local employees of our mission in Turkey and about cases against U.S. citizens who have been arrested under the state of emergency. We will continue to engage with our Turkish counterparts to seek a satisfactory resolution to these cases, and we call upon Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson and other U.S. citizens whom we believe are being unjustly detained. With regard to Serkan Golge, we believe his release through the appeals process would be both just and appropriate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want to thank again President Erdogan and Foreign Minister Cavusoglu for the opportunity to discuss these and many other very, very important issues, and for the cooperation we both have been able to show one another and respect in charting a way forward in this relationship. The United States truly appreciates our long friendship with Turkey. We value it, and we look forward to strengthening it as we move forward. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> (In Turkish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Sevil Erkus from <i>Hurriyet Daily</i>. My first question will be to our guest, Secretary of State. Mr. Tillerson, we are actually passing one of the most critical stages of the Turkish-United States relations. In order to overcome these problematic aspects \u2013 the aspect pertaining to the assistance of military equipment to YPG and PYD \u2013 Ankara worries. In order to overcome all these worries, and also, in the context of Syria, to establish cooperation between Turkey and United States, do you have any proposals for solutions? Could you share these with you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, if the Afrin operation is extended to Manbij, the fact that there are American soldiers there \u2013 do you have any plans to withdraw forces from that region, or the fact that they\u2019re at harm?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy question to you, Mr. Foreign Minister --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) So we said actually two questions each, but you have asked more than 10 now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) My question to you: Before you said either these relations are going to go worse or going to be improved. You said today that you had taken a decision to normalize relations. Did you get the relevant warranties or safeguards from the United States that you were expecting from your side?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother aspect: With respect to a news item that was reflected on the media, it was indicated that the troops on Manbij would be withdrawn to the eastern part of Euphrates and that this was a proposal that you brought. Did you make such a proposal indeed so that the American troops were withdrawn from that area, and how does American side resolve?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) So this is actually a question for two hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>In our discussions last night with President Erdogan, we brought forward proposals on how we can address all of the critical issues that are standing between this relationship today. And those will be addressed \u2013 some will be addressed in the joint statement that we will be releasing following this press avail. But the foreign minister did touch on a few of those, and we want to work specifically on the issues that are standing between us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat we have agreed is our objectives for Syria are precisely the same. There are \u2013 there\u2019s no daylight between Turkey and the U.S. objectives: defeat ISIS, stabilize the country, create stabilization areas so eventually refugees and internally displaced persons can begin to return home, and support the political solution for Syria that will result in a whole, independent, democratic Syria with no special demarcations dividing Syria and with the Syrian people selecting their leadership through free and fair elections. And we all share that same objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd now, going from this point forward, we are going to closely coordinate our efforts against the final defeat of Daesh. We do not have them fully defeated today, but we\u2019re going to coordinate our efforts against the final defeat of Daesh as well as other terrorist groups that are located inside of Syria. We want to coordinate how to stabilize areas together and who will occupy those areas. And the objective and intent is to return these villages, these cities back to the composition of people who were there before they were overrun by Daesh. So we\u2019re going to address Manbij first. It\u2019s one of the first areas we\u2019re going to work on. The United States made commitments to Turkey previously. We\u2019ve not completed fulfilling those commitments. Through the working group we\u2019re going to address that, and Manbij is going to receive priority.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut it\u2019s not just Manbij. We have to think about all of northern Syria, and we\u2019ve agreed on certain areas we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work together, and then we\u2019re going to coordinate very closely on supporting the Geneva process, because ultimately, that is the pathway to a peaceful, stable Syria. That improves Turkey\u2019s security as well on its border when we can achieve that final peace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. At the beginning of my remarks, I said that this was a very critical visit for the future of our relations. It was a critical timing. Therefore, in the meetings that we held since yesterday evening, we talked about how our expectations were to be met, and there were other concerns of the United States on their citizens, about the local employees of the consulate. There were, of course, expectations on their side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re already working on these consular issues, but our worries were in direct relation to the direct threats that we were receiving about the YPG attacking our citizens, because our people are dying. Up to this point, we had about 100 citizens, Turkish citizens, or Syrian-origin people coming from Afrin. They were killed by missiles or by arms that were coming from Afrin. They lost their lives because of this. So of course, undoubtfully, this working group which is going to meet our expectations and the concrete steps that we will take is crucial. This is important on YPG, on ISIS/ISIL, on FETO. These are important with relation to all of these aspects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, on Manbij, of course, Rex Tillerson gave the answer to your question. And in 2016, there were commitments of the United States to Turkey at every level, including President Obama, John Kerry, and Mr. (inaudible), who is still at his position, and by other people in high-level positions, but these promises were not kept. And even at one point, we were to send a delegation to tell that YPG was actually going to move to the eastern part of Euphrates, but from that visit we were not convinced and we learned later on that they had not moved. So in this process, we are going to start from Manbij, and we will be sure of the steps that we have taken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also need to ensure that YPG is going to move to the eastern part of the Euphrates. We need to see the implementation together, and Rex stated very clearly: For stability in these regions, we will talk about as to who is going to manage these cities and who is going to provide the security. If Manbij is 95 percent Arab town, it actually does not make any sense that YPG is going to provide security there, because that will mean that there will not be any stability there. So we will be talking with this understanding so that stability is attained and we will be rest assured of the security. It\u2019s not just for Manbij, but we will start from there. And once YPG leaves that and after we have the trust established, we will be able to take steps together with the United States of America, but now YPG needs to leave that zone, and this is a commitment that the United States of America has made to us, and we will be talking about the implementation of how this promise will be kept. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> (In Turkish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Mr. Secretary, there seems to be a little short on specifics here. Do you agree that you are talking about what you\u2019re going to do in the future and you have not agreed on specific steps that will begin starting today? And can you explain why it has taken so long for two allies to come together with an agreement on what seems to be a very basic principle, that two allies will not shoot at each other in Syria and one will not give the other an \u201cOttoman slap\u201d? Are you confident that in the future some of the rhetoric will be turned down, and what has been the hang-up?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, I wanted to ask you if you agree that some of the rhetoric in recent weeks from yourself and your president has been overheated and unhelpful. And also, what will it take for your government to finally be confident enough to lift the state of emergency and release thousands of your own citizens, plus the American citizens and embassy employees who have been imprisoned on what much of the world considers to be very flimsy evidence? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, with respect to how we\u2019re going forward \u2013 and that\u2019s what all of the discussion here was about, recognizing where we find ourselves. And I think as the foreign minister indicated, we find ourselves at a bit of a crisis point in the relationship. And we could go back and revisit how we got here, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s useful. We\u2019ve decided and President Erdogan decided last night we needed to talk about how do we go forward. The relationship is too important, it\u2019s too valuable to NATO and our NATO allies, it\u2019s too valuable to the American people, it\u2019s too valuable to the Turkish people for us to not do anything other than concentrate on how are we going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd out of the meetings last night \u2013 and much of our staff was up through the night to memorialize how we\u2019re going to go about this, and we\u2019ll share a little bit of that in the joint statement. We\u2019re going to reserve a lot of the details because there\u2019s a lot of work yet to be done, and we \u2013 and our working teams need to be allowed to do that work in a very open, frank, honest way with one another so that we can chart the way forward together. And I think that\u2019s the important point I want you to take away here, is we\u2019re not going to act alone any longer. We\u2019re not going to be U.S. doing one thing and Turkey doing another. We are going to act together from this point forward. We\u2019re going to lock arms, we\u2019re going to work through the issues that are causing difficulties for us, and we\u2019re going to resolve them and we\u2019re going to move forward with the future defeat of ISIS in terms of coordinating our efforts to complete this battle, which is not yet complete; to addressing other terrorist presence inside of Syria; to stabilizing areas and ensuring that the stability architecture, both security forces and governing councils, are representative of the conditions that existed in those cities before they were overrun by ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we have good mechanisms on how we can achieve that, but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. People are going to have to roll their sleeves up. We\u2019re going to get started very quickly. As the foreign minister said, we\u2019re going to have the first round of these engagements before the middle of March. We know we need to move with some sense of urgency and promptness to address this, because we have a serious situation still inside of Syria, and we need to address that jointly together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I would say the specifics will emerge out of the work as we allow these groups to come together, but I think the objective, we\u2019ve made clear as to what our objective is. So now we\u2019re going to have a team of people working towards putting that in place and implementing it, and we\u2019ve given you a little bit \u2013 just a little bit of a peek of some of the early priorities we\u2019re going to place for these groups to work on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much for your question. Since last night, we have been talking about how we can overcome these problems, and these are not just explanations and announcements coming from our side. That will not be a realistic approach. Our declarations was not declarations of enmity. And of course, we were taking into consideration our worries and the realities that we show \u2013 show from our side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLikewise, as politicians, sometimes we take certain steps, and by the steps that we take and by the commitments that we have paid, we might be guiding this popular sentiment with the positive inputs. But when it comes to a point \u2013 this is true for all political sphere, but in Turkey, the president of the republic and we as politicians, including me, we should be voicing the opinion of the Turkish public, because we are representing them. And the declarations that we made were just ramifications of the popular thought in Turkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the detention or the prosecution that is taking place \u2013 this does not have anything to do with the state of emergency in Turkey, and this state of emergency is nothing to restrict the fundamental rights and freedoms of Turkish citizens or anybody living in Turkey. In 2003, one of the first steps that we took when we came to government was actually to remove the state of emergency in southeast part of Turkey. In some European countries, after one terrorist attack there is a state of emergency declared. But we, on the other hand, were \u2013 the leader of a terrorist organization who is residing in Pennsylvania attempted a coup in our country. So with the state of emergency, we needed to take rapid steps against this terrorist organization. This was the expectation of our people. So the prosecution that is continuing in Turkey has been in line with the EU, with the Council of Europe criteria, and in line with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the legislation which has been democratically enacted in Turkey in parallel with those standards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this prosecution within the state of emergency has nothing to do with any judicial proceeding that goes on in this period. Therefore, independent courts that have been established and that have been reformed with the legislation in parallel to the standards of the EU and the Council of Europe are conducted. It does not have any \u2013 does not receive any direction from any other third country or a political intervention from within. And the state of emergency does not have any connection to this. We do hope that within this whole process we would always have the following: that in terms of accelerating in the prosecution we might have certain recommendations, but in the end, the independent judiciary passes judgment. The appeal process is open. You can go all the way up to the constitutional court. We do have an individual application system to the constitutional court and even the European Court of Human Rights. So the remedies in terms of the legal sphere go all the way up to Strasbourg within that understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Gonca Senay from TRT World. I have questions to both ministers. In terms of earning in the trust of the Turkish public, I think we listed the expectations on the Turkish side, but I do want to ask a question to Mr. Tillerson, especially reminding him of the budget drop that was proposed by Pentagon. Will the arms assistance provided to YPG by the United States of America \u2013 is it going to cease? And this morning, there was certain news that the Turkish soldiers would be acting together with the American soldiers in Manbij. Thirdly, will you take a step on the FETO issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMr. Cavusoglu, my question to you is that you talked about certain mechanisms involving FETO, and you said that you were talking about the mid-March. Is there any timetable, or is this an agreement that both sides have reached? And what is going to be the level of this working group? What level in the administration? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>With respect to DOD\u2019s budget for the coming year, only sufficient funds have been included in their budget to continue the defeat of ISIS campaign, and this is to continue to supply the SDF forces primarily with ammunition, because this fight goes on. There\u2019s no more being provided than we believe is necessary to complete the battle to defeat Daesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe question of Manbij is one that, as I said, is going to be given priority in our joint working group effort, and this is one of \u2013 as the foreign minister indicated, one of the issues for us to work together on is what kind of security should be provided. Manbij is strategically a very important city from the standpoint of our defeat of Daesh but also our containment and ensuring that they do not re-emerge. It\u2019s geographically important. That\u2019s why the U.S. has left a troop presence in Manbij to ensure that that city remains under control of our allied forces and does not fall into the hands of others. So that will be a topic for discussion in terms of how we go forward to ensure Manbij remains within our control because of its strategic importance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we did agree \u2013 we had a lot of conversation last night with President Erdogan regarding the concerns over Fethullah Gulen back in the United States as well as his organization, and we\u2019ve agreed that we will continue to examine all the evidence that can be provided to us. We will continue our own efforts at our own independent investigations to ensure that we know when illegal activities are being carried out in the United States, and we remain open and anxious to receive any new information and evidence that the Turkish Government can provide us as well. So it remains an open investigation with the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. As I have just mentioned and I \u2013 as I repeatedly say, the purpose of these mechanisms and working groups is to keep the promises that were not kept so far, and in order to take tangible and concrete steps. This is true for YPG; this is true for FETO as well. And in Syria, not only ISIS/ISIL, because we have achieved important results regarding ISIS/ISIL, and the Republic of Turkey has fighted more than everyone in this fight, and it just killed more than 3,000 Turks in just Syria. And as \u2013 in \u2013 with regards to foreign fighters, their extradition and their prevention in terms of entering in the country, we have taken important steps and we have also served as a co-chair as well in the council. But we need to fight against all types of terrorist organizations in order to achieve the political framework that we have just described with new constitution, with new laws. We want to take the country to an election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, these working groups will have different boards, and for example, in the first one, the ministry of foreign affairs will be the coordinator. However, there will be officers from the intelligence unit from the ministry of justice as well. And especially regarding financial crimes and regarding topics about the corruptions of FETO terrorist organizations, we will have representatives from the department of financial crimes. And as it was mentioned by Rex and by relevant authorities, recently there are investigations carried out regarding FETO schools in this United States, and it will bear us the results about the corruption taking place in the U.S. and how they achieve, how they earn these money for election. And with just simple investigations, we \u2013 they will see these results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd again, regarding Syria, we will have our soldiers \u2013 I mean the ministry of defense \u2013 we will have intelligence units and other relevant authorities in these groups and in these wars. So we have identified the participants and we have agreed on the parties as well, and from now on we will try to come together and achieve results altogether.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Did you warn Turkey that they could be subject to sanctions under CAATSA legislation if they go ahead with the purchase of the S-400 system?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd for you, Mr. Foreign Minister, would the threat of U.S. sanctions stop you from going ahead with the purchase of the S-400 system? And if you do buy the system, do you still want to remain in NATO if you\u2019re obtaining the weapons from Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>We did discuss the impact of the CAATSA law that was passed by the Congress last summer that deals with purchases of Russian military equipment. I discussed it last night with President Erdogan; we had further discussions this morning about it. And indeed, it\u2019s in the first group of issues that the foreign minister is referring to. We need to put a group of experts together, and we\u2019ll look at the circumstances around that, as we\u2019ve done with governments all over the world, not just Turkey, because the intent of that legislation was not to harm our friends and allies. But it is directed at Russia for its interference in our elections. So we\u2019ve been advising countries around the world as to what the impact on their relationship and purchases that they might be considering with Russia, and many have reconsidered those and have decided to not proceed with those discussions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEvery case is individual on its own. We want to consult with Turkey and at least ensure they understand what might be at risk in this particular transaction. We don\u2019t have all the details yet, so I can\u2019t give you any kind of a conclusion, but it\u2019ll be given very careful scrutiny, obviously, and we\u2019ll fully comply with the law. And we are \u2013 we are now implementing CAATSA and fully applying it around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> Thank you very much. First and foremost, I need to underline that I am against the terminology that you use. You used the threat terminology. That is not a correct terminology to be used because it is true for all countries and states. We never use the language of threat and we deny if it is used against us, because this is not correct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut as Rex has also indicated, this was not something that we talked just yesterday and today. When we met in Vancouver, we talked about this, and from time to time when we have phone conversations, we talk about such issues. This was again brought to the agenda in one of those talks. Of course, there is a law that was enacted by the United States Congress, and they explained this legislation to us. But on the other hand, this is our national security, and it\u2019s important for our national security. I have emergency need of an air defense system. We want to purchase this from our allies, but this does not exist. So even when we are purchasing small-scale arms, the Congress or some other European parliaments, we have \u2013 we have and we had difficulty in purchasing these because of these excuses, and I have an emergency need. And the Russian Federation came up with attractive proposals for us. We also talked to other countries, not just with Russia, but we talked about this issue of emergency need with many countries and we had bilateral talks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in the mid-term, we talked about joint production and technology transfer. We focused on this because this is important for Turkey. And lastly, during the Paris visit of our president \u2013 with Eurosam \u2013 this is a French-Italian partnership \u2013 there was a pre-agreement signed, a memorandum of understanding signed with these groups. So we do not have any problems with our allies. Why should we not meet this requirement with NATO? But, of course, when it is not met within this platform, we need to look for alternative resources. Otherwise, some batteries \u2013 some Patriot were withdrawn from our frontier. Some European allies withdrew them. We have (inaudible) of the Italians and Patriots of Spain, and we do not have any other air defense. And we need to meet this requirement as soon as possible. And when we talked to Russia, this was actually an agreement that we reached before the legislation in Congress was enacted. And the remaining part was about the details of loans, et cetera.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, we talked about all of these, and we will take into consideration this \u2013 within this working group the commission, but all of us need to understand each other and respect each other. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\tAt the 37<sup>th</sup> Human Rights Council session in Geneva, February 26-March 23, the U.S. addressed urgent human rights situations around the world. This session brought attention to human rights issues in Iran, Syria, North Korea, Burma, Cambodia and South Sudan, among others. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee delivered our national statement on February 28, underscoring the U.S. commitment to human rights, as well as our continued concerns about the Council\u2019s disproportionate focus on Israel and our commitment to reforming the Council. The United States introduced a resolution on South Sudan that the Council adopted with broad cross-regional support. Our active engagement on all other Council actions allowed the U.S. to protect critical legal and policy equities and achieve successful outcomes. In addition, through national and joint statements, the United States addressed human rights situations in China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, the DRC, Egypt, Turkey, Burundi, Azerbaijan, the Maldives, Vietnam, and Bahrain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Supporting Israel:</b> The United States worked closely with Israel and other partners to combat the institutionalized bias against Israel both by opposing Agenda Item 7, the only Council agenda item focused on a single country, and by voting against every resolution introduced under Item 7. Australia joined in voting against all Item 7 resolutions, while many other partners changed votes to either vote no or abstain. This session demonstrated the largest shift in votes towards more abstentions and no votes on Israel related resolutions since the creation of the HRC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Standing up for the Integrity of UN Human Rights Mechanisms:</b> The United States voted against a China-led resolution on <b>mutually beneficial cooperation</b>, which sought to weaken international human rights frameworks by demanding that governments be \u201crespected\u201d (i.e. not have their human rights records criticized) and suggesting that governments could agree on \u201cwin-win\u201d exceptions to human rights concerns. In a strong explanation of vote, the United States underscored that \u201cfeel good\u201d language about mutually beneficial cooperation is intended to benefit autocratic states at the expense of individuals whose human rights and fundamental freedoms we should all respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Iran</b>: The United States played a key role in garnering support for the resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The United States also read, on behalf of a group of 27 countries, a joint statement addressing the recent crackdown in Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>North Korea:</b> The United States supported a resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, condemned the ongoing systematic and widespread human rights violations and abuses, called for accountability, and voiced ongoing support for monitoring and documentation efforts by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Syria: </b>The United States supported an urgent debate on the dire situation in eastern Ghouta, which culminated in a resolution condemning the violations of the ceasefire. The United States also co-sponsored the resolution renewing the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which condemned the violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law throughout Syria, primarily by the Assad regime, including the use of chemical weapons, abuse of detainees, and denial of humanitarian aid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>South Sudan:</b> The United States led a resolution to renew the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for another year to collect and preserve evidence that can be used in future judicial efforts, including the AU Hybrid Court for South Sudan. We worked closely with South Sudan, members of the African Group, and other member states to ensure the text was adopted by consensus. South Sudan\u2019s support for the resolution reaffirmed its commitment to continue cooperating with the Commission and UN bodies and mechanisms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Burma: </b>The United States co-sponsored an EU-led resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and support the work of other special procedures, including the Fact Finding Mission, which are invaluable in investigating and highlighting the human rights situation in Burma. The resolution was adopted following a vote called by China.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Cambodia</b>: The United States joined 44 other countries in supporting New Zealand\u2019s joint statement highlighting the decline in civil and political rights in Cambodia in the run up to national elections scheduled for July 29. The joint statement noted that an electoral process from which the main democratic opposition party is arbitrarily excluded cannot be considered genuine or legitimate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Other Country Situations:</b> The United States co-sponsored priority resolutions that renewed mandates on <b>Burma</b> and <b>North Korea</b>, as well as a resolution drawing attention to the human rights situations in <b>Georgia</b>, including the Russian-occupied territories of Georgia. We supported cooperative resolutions on <b>Libya</b> and <b>Mali.</b> The United States also delivered a statement supporting the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 engagement in <b>Yemen</b>, <b>Georgia</b>, <b>Afghanistan</b>, and <b>Haiti</b>. Additionally, the United States joined joint statements highlighting serious concerns regarding the human rights situations in <b>Cambodia</b>, <b>Maldives</b>, and <b>Sri Lanka</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Development Resolutions: </b>The United States worked actively to remove trade-related language from resolutions on development, and to ensure that all resolutions that touch on development make clear that states may not use their lack of development or related concerns to excuse a failure to uphold their human rights obligations or commitments. We re-stated our long-standing opposition to recognizing a \u201cright to development.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Thematic Issues:</b> The United States co-sponsored resolutions on <b>freedom of religion or belief</b>, <b>good governance</b>, the prevention of <b>genocide</b>, the rights of <b>minorities</b> and of persons with <b>disabilities</b>, and the impact of corruption on <b>torture</b>, among others. The United States also opposed a cynical Russia-led resolution on \u201cintegrity of the judicial system,\u201d which failed to address issues of judicial independence, and inaccurately reflected aspects of international law.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I am honored to welcome you to the 12th Annual Secretary of State\u2019s International Women of Courage Awards, which have recognized more than 120 remarkable women from dozens of countries since the award\u2019s inception. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In addition to the privilege of being joined by the First Lady, I would also like to extend a special welcome to the members of the diplomatic corps in the audience, including Ambassador Callista Gingrich. Where is she? She\u2019s here somewhere. Thank you, there she is. Ambassador Gingrich, welcome. (Applause.) She joins us from the Vatican today and has been in Washington this week. It\u2019s wonderful to have you back here with us.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We know that women\u2019s voices are critical to global security, prosperity, and peace, which is why the Department of State annually presents the International Women of Courage Awards. Each awardee\u2019s story is an inspiring reminder of how individuals can make a difference. Taken together, they provide a powerful message of courage and leadership. And you can read some of their profiles in your pamphlets that you have with you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This year we have recognized 10 extraordinary women who have demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight day in and day out for what they believe. The formidable leaders include a former slave and anti-slavery activist, a human rights lawyer documenting abuse under the junta rule, a nun sheltering internally displaced people from violence, a writer, director, and producer who wrote scripts under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and a courageous advocate for the families of forcibly disappeared persons.

The new law affirms the United States commitment to expanding women\u2019s leadership on the issues of international peace and security, especially efforts to prevent conflict and atrocities, promote peace and counterterrorism, and also violent extremism. We know that when women are empowered, communities are safer and countries are more stable. We see that around the world every day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Another way to ensure that women are empowered is by expanding economic access and opportunity. Reports show that if the world closed the gender gap in workforce participation, global GDP would increase by $28 trillion by the year 2025. That is precisely why President Trump galvanized the creation of the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Finance Initiative through a U.S. contribution of $50 million at the G20 Leaders Summit last summer. Along with contributions from international partners, the initiative has leveraged more than 340 million in support to help advance women\u2019s entrepreneurship around the globe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>From day one, the Trump administration has been committed to empowering women. Women\u2019s empowerment is not only a basic fulfilment of human rights, but a strategic investment in our collective future. Women and girls must have the tools they need to succeed and the pathways that they seek opened. That includes a safe environment that promotes their health and also their education. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Whether at home or abroad, expanding opportunities for women and girls is a priority of this President for this administration. And today I\u2019m honored to introduce someone who plays a central role in this critical initiative. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>As a philanthropist and a humanitarian, the First Lady has been a driving force behind the administration\u2019s efforts to promote the empowerment of women and children in our society. Mrs. Trump has been an Honorary Chairwoman for the Boys\u2019 Club of New York for five consecutive years and in 2005 was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador for the American Red Cross. She helped launch the National Child Abuse Prevention Month in April of 2008 and has been a champion for the American Heart Association. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Her deep concern for issues affecting children continues. As First Lady she is focused on the challenges of what children are exposed to online through technology. And as a mom whose children are always trying to sneak her electronic devices, I thank you for your work on that. (Laughter.) A lot of us can relate to that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump works tirelessly to raise awareness of the damaging effects of opioids and the harmful effects that drugs can have on pregnant women, particularly on newborns who develop neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS. Mrs. Trump, the State Department has watched with a great deal of pride as you visited hospitals and women\u2019s groups around the country to draw attention to this. Thank you for that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump is a powerful voice promoting women\u2019s equality and improving the lives of women and girls around the world. Now please join me in welcoming the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Melania Trump. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The First Lady gives remarks.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Mrs. Trump. Thanks to all of you. As Mrs. Trump just discussed, courage takes many, many forms. This year, we are honored to recognize 10 extraordinary women who have dedicated and demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight for what they believe in day in and day out. I\u2019d like to introduce you to these women.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>First, we have Roya Sadat. She\u2019s from Afghanistan. She is a writer, a producer, a film director. Ms. Sadat, she\u2019s over here. She is being honored for refusing to be silenced in her home country. She uses the arts to raise awareness of the brutal challenges facing women and girls, and despite threats to herself, her cast, and her crew, she\u2019s served as a pioneer for Afghanistan\u2019s cultural reawakening. In fact, she wrote her film, \u201cThree Dots,\u201d while keeping it a secret from the Taliban, and many of you will recall that entertainment was not allowed \u2013 music, films, all of that was not allowed under the Taliban. Congratulations to you. Thank you for your bravery. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next, from Honduras, we have Dr. Julissa Villanueva.

A humanitarian volunteer working to resist sectarian and radical ideology, Ms. Saleh is being honored for her bravery, her heroism, and her compassion in the wake of ISIS terror. She selflessly risked her own life to save others. In fact, she is credited with rescuing 58 young Iraqi military cadets who were ambushed by ISIS back in 2014. Imagine the bravery that takes for a woman in that country. It\u2019s really incredible. She risked her own life to save others, and working with all Iraqi communities as well as security forces. Congratulations. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Such tremendous bravery in this room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Sister Maria Elena Berini. She\u2019s from Italy. She\u2019s a Sister of Charity of Saint (inaudible) Antide Thouret. She was born in Italy but works at a Catholic mission in the Central African Republic. Sister Maria Elena is being honored for her service to counter hatred, injustice, and war-related horrors. She has provided refuge to those internally displaced people by conflict; and her tireless work to bring peace in the Central African Republic. Thank you, Sister. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aiman Umarova. She\u2019s from Kazakhstan. She is a lawyer, a human rights defender, a promoter of justice and other reforms. Ms. Umarova is being honored for improving laws to address violence against women and children, delivering justice in a number of landmark cases for rape victims, and her efforts in countering violent extremism despite the grave risks that she faces in Kazakhstan. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Dr. Feride Rushiti is from Kosovo. She\u2019s the founder and executive director of the Kosovo Center for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims. Dr. Rushiti is being honored for decades of advocacy on behalf of civilian victims of Kosovo\u2019s war, including rape survivors, and she\u2019s laid the groundwork for a legislative victory to support survivors of wartime sexual violence. Thank you, Doctor. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To Mauritania now. I would like to introduce you to L\u2019Malouma Said from Mauritania. She\u2019s a former slave and now a deputy member of parliament in Mauritania\u2019s National Assembly. That is incredible. (Applause.) Mrs. Said is being honored \u2013 wait here, Mrs. Said. (Laughter.) You can stay here. We\u2019re not done yet. Stay right there. Thank you. Mrs. Said is being honored for her relentless activism in the fight against slavery, including work in the country\u2019s most effective anti-slavery organization; perseverance and promotion of human rights and equality; and resolve in addressing a failing prison system in Mauritania. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Godelive Mukasarasi is from Rwanda. She\u2019s the founder and coordinator of an NGO dedicated to helping widows and orphans of the Rwandan genocide, and she is herself a survivor of that trauma. She is being honored for her instrumental role in bringing women\u2019s voices to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, leading to the first historic conviction of rape as a war crime. Thank you, ma\u2019am, for your courage. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next, Sirikan Charoensiri is from Thailand. She is a lawyer and human rights defender and is being honored for fiercely standing up for human rights. She includes \u2013 this includes the rights to peaceful assembly and expression. During Thailand\u2019s military rule, she co-founded an organization to provide pro bono legal services to those who are facing politically motivated charges and overcoming unprecedented harassment and persecution. As a result of her advocacy, she now faces three sets of criminal charges for her work as a lawyer, and those charges include sedition. What a brave woman. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next to Guatemala. Aura Elena Farfan in a human rights activist and an advocate for families of the forcibly disappeared during Guatemala\u2019s civil war in the 1960s and subsequent conflicts. Ms. Farfan is being honored for her 33 years of fearless leadership and enabling the prosecution of former military officers involved in extrajudicial killings. She has been an activist since her brother disappeared back in 1984. Since then, she\u2019s received death threats, and has even been kidnapped by armed assailants in her country. We recognize Ms. Farfan in absentia today, as she is not able to travel to Washington from Guatemala due to a current medical condition that she suffers.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So please join me in thanking these women, welcoming these women to the United States, and I would like to introduce you to our next speaker. Please join me in giving a round of applause for this remarkable group of leaders, and it is my pleasure to introduce one of our women of courage, who will give remarks on behalf of the group, Godelive Mukasarasi from Rwanda. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS MUKASARASI:</b> Mrs. Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to stand here to tell you my joy and my gratitude for this acknowledgement of my work in Rwanda. As a committed activist, I have been fighting for the rights of women, victims of rape, and their children born of such rapes during the genocide against the Tutsis in 1993 and \u201994. Through an extensive therapy process to help heal them of their trauma and through active advocacy, the rape victims have become models of self-development and resilient citizens.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>During the genocide, one million innocent lives were lost and millions of survivors were affected by the trauma, left with physical and emotional wounds. Rape has been used as a war weapon. Tutsi women and girls raped, raped en masse, and some of them became pregnant or by the militia and soldiers of the former regime. A number of these women were infected with HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Some underwent genital mutilation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Others were forced to marry the perpetrators as a price to escape death, therefore becoming sexual servants and captives. When the militias were defeated, the women returned to their families but were rejected and stigmatized by relatives for having been the spouse of a militia member or for being pregnant by them. They were told to abort or to walk away with their cursed pregnancy. Some of these women decided to abort or they have left their families to hide far away, protecting those babies who today are beautiful 24 year-old women and the men.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Even too, the Government of Rwanda has done everything to address the effect of the genocide, the cases of rape were kept silent, because speaking of sexual issues is taboo in Rwanda culture. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Breaking the silence of this crime, I started the SEVOTA organization in Taba in December 1994. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Before meeting SEVOTA organization, every woman thought she was alone and would remain humiliated. But when sharing their stories, they find out that they could decided to accept themselves and accept their children. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>After experiencing the SEVOTA healing session and receiving assistance, these Rwandan women decide to speak out against the rape and stood up to testify about them in the international criminal court of Rwanda. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These women \u2013 these women\u2019s advocacy persuaded the international community make rape punishable as a crime against humanity. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These resilient women and young people are fully integrated in the community, undertaking income-producing activities, sustaining themselves, and preventing renewed trauma. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>However, there is the need for more attention, as many of them are living with post-traumatic effects such as HIV/AIDS, poverty, and a fragilized and wounded memory.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This is why SEVOTA continues to advocate, to heal, and to participate in self-development program using different channel \u2013 different channel, such as the recent film \u201cThe Uncondemned,\u201d where Seraphine, Victoria, and Cecile played a key role in speaking out. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my profound gratitude toward those who have encouraged me, including the Government of Rwanda, which appoint me as one of the guardians of the social pacts, and the institution who have selected me for this prize. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Finally, I would like to extend many thank you who have attended this ceremony, and most of all, my sincerest thanks to First Lady Mrs. Melania Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, the Secretary Office for Global Women\u2019s Issues, and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you. Godelive, thank you so much. Please join me in a final round of applause for this remarkable group of women leaders. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States will continue to work the advance \u2013 the rights of women and girls globally, well aware that when women do better, countries do better, families do better, we all do better. Mrs. Trump, thank you for your inspiring words and for being part of today\u2019s ceremony and our ceremony last year as well. This is certainly your passion, and we are so grateful to have you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees, thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do. Thank you for your bravery, for your commitment, especially in the face of adversity. We honor you and your work.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At this time, I\u2019d like to ask the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients to please stand for a group photo together, and we\u2019ll get a picture together, and then we\u2019ll conclude our ceremonies.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Awardees then depart. Let\u2019s take a picture first.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The picture is taken.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees depart. Thank you, ladies. (Applause.) And thanks to all of you for coming today. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>For those of us who are joining us in our reception, you are now invited to proceed to the Ben Franklin room, and that is on the eighth floor. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, our First Lady, and thank you to these wonderful ladies. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "official_name": "Brian Hook",
        "official_title": "Director of Policy Planning",
        "date": "March 21, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us, and apologies for the slight delay in getting started. Brian Hook is joining us. As you all know, Brian was just in Europe with a delegation from the State Department and also the NSC, where Brian was meeting\u2014 and our colleagues\u2014 meeting with members of the E3 in Berlin, and then he went to Vienna \u2013 they all went to Vienna \u2013 for the quarterly meeting with the JCPOA. Brian met with press last week and overseas, and would like to provide you all not only with an update but a \u2013 just sort of an analysis and readout of where we are in the overall discussions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Brian will make some comments and then we\u2019ll have time to take several of your questions. We ask that you wait until the end of the call to start writing about this and tweeting, as we normally do, and embargoed. That\u2019s a simple way of putting it: embargoed until the conclusion of the call.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Director of Policy Planning Brian Hook for his comments and your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thank you, Heather, and thank you for organizing this call, and thanks to everybody who\u2019s joined the call. As Heather mentioned, there was an American delegation that first went to Berlin and then we went to Vienna for the Joint Commission meeting, and let me say just a little bit about both meetings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Berlin, this is the third meeting with our European allies since the President delivered his statement on January 12th. As you know, on January 12th, the President set forth the conditions that would need to be met in order for the \u2013 for him to continue waving sanctions as part of America\u2019s commitments in the JCPOA. And what the President asked for on January 12th was a new supplemental agreement with European allies that (inaudible) impose new multilateral sanctions if Iran develops or tests long-range missiles, thwarts inspections, or makes progress toward a nuclear weapon. And he has given his negotiating team until May 12th to reach a supplemental agreement to fix the deficiencies of the Iran nuclear deal. And so we have been operating under that guidance since then. We have had three meetings with our European allies \u2013 one in London, one in Paris, and then the last one was in Berlin \u2013 and at these meetings we are negotiating a new supplemental agreement and we are also \u2013 and the focus there is around the sunsets, the sunsetting of restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the omission of ICBMs from the original Iran nuclear agreement, and a stronger inspections regime so that we can support the work of the IAEA so they can verify that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 in all of these meetings, half of our day is spent negotiating a supplemental agreement. The other half of the day we spend on making progress on the six areas that the President identified on January 12th. He called on our allies to take stronger steps with the United States to confront Iran\u2019s other malign activities, and that includes cutting off funding to the IRGC and constraining Iran\u2019s missile development program, countering Iran\u2019s cyber aggression, its maritime aggression, asking other countries to pressure Iran for all of its human rights violations. So we spend half of these meetings working on steps that we need to take collectively against Iran\u2019s other activities, and this is consistent with the policy shift that this administration effected, which is addressing the totality of Iranian threats and not having (inaudible) on the nuclear deal at the exclusion of all of the other threats that Iran presents. And I would refer you to the President\u2019s statement on January 12th for more detail on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe then went to Vienna for a meeting of the Joint Commission. I think as many of you know, the Joint Commission is part of the JCPOA and it oversees the implementation of the Plan of Action that was reached in 2015 with the previous administration, and it meets on a regular basis to review Iran\u2019s compliance with the JCPOA and to address concerns raised by member states. They were productive meetings and we fulfilled what we set out to do. We are meeting our commitments under the JCPOA, and we will \u2013 we continue to hold Iran strictly accountable for its commitments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that we did in that meeting was to take stock of one of the key provisions of the JCPOA, which is that the Iran deal will, quote, \u201cpositively contribute to regional and international peace and security.\u201d That is mentioned in the deal, and since it took over two years to negotiate and every word was weighed carefully, we take all of these provisions seriously. And when you look at Iran\u2019s foreign and domestic policies, it\u2019s impossible to argue that they have \u2013 that they are behaving constructively or with greater moderation in the last two years. In fact, quite the reverse. They are aggressively destabilizing the Middle East and present a range of threats to peace and security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this was an opportunity for us in Vienna to listen to any concerns that the Iranians had about us meeting our end of the deal. The Iranians complained that this administration is warning other nations about the dangers of doing business in Iran and that this is hurting their economy. And what I said in response was that Iran\u2019s opaque economy makes it hard for investors to know whether they are supporting commerce or supporting terrorism, and I said that Iran needs to stop sponsoring terrorism, stop destabilizing the Middle East, and overhaul its banking and business sectors. It\u2019s not America\u2019s job to make up for the shortcomings of Iranian policies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also requested a meeting with the Iranian delegation to demand the release of the American citizens that they have arbitrarily and unjustly detained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the summary of the meetings in Berlin and Vienna. I\u2019m happy to take questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll go ahead and take your questions. And Nicole has a list of who\u2019s on the call, so I\u2019ll just defer to my colleague, Nicole, who will handle that. Nicole, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * then 1.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur first question comes from the line of Josh Lederman, AP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I was wondering if you have spoken to Director Pompeo in the last week about this deal. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that Secretary Tillerson was more enthusiastic about trying to salvage this deal than perhaps Pompeo will be. So can you tell us how that transition may affect the work that you\u2019re doing on this. And then if you can give us any details about your separate meeting with the Iranians; did you make any progress on those detained Americans? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks, Josh. On the first question, I don\u2019t want to comment on internal discussions. What I can say is that a number of us are providing assistance to Secretary-designate Pompeo\u2019s confirmation process, and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the Senate confirmation process, but if he is confirmed, and we certainly hope he will be, he will then be, I think, well equipped to do all of the work that we\u2019re currently working on, the range of activities that he\u2019s been working on as CIA Director. And so I think he\u2019s got such a deep familiarity with so many of these issues from his current position that it will be a very easy transition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn your other question, can you remind me, Josh? I couldn\u2019t \u2013 what was the second part of the question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, the other question was about your bilat with the Iranians. Did you make any progress?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Oh yeah, the bilat with the \u2013 yeah, the bilat with the Iranians, as I said, the only purpose in requesting it was to demand the release of the Americans that they\u2019ve detained. Given the sensitivity of that subject, I don\u2019t want to go beyond what I said, that I requested the meeting and I did have a discussion with them, and that\u2019s as much as I can say on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And can you tell us whether you expect to stay at S/P?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK: </strong>Everyone in the Executive Branch serves at the pleasure of the President, and I am continuing to advance the administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And that question comes from the line of Karen DeYoung, <em>Washington Post.</em> Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Karen, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello? Oh, hi. Thank you. You said that the United States is complying with all of its commitments under the JCPOA, although you mentioned the part that says that they need to pay attention to certain other things. Would you say that they are or are not complying with their commitments under the JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> I would say that they are in \u2013 that they are in technical \u2013 we have not heard \u2013 we go over sanctions and we go over nuclear \u2013 we talked about the nuclear issues, civil nuclear on the agenda for the Joint Commission, and they are in technical \u2013 my understanding is that they are in technical compliance with their commitments under the JCPOA. The Iranians had a number of complaints about licenses, especially around civil aviation licenses to Iran Air and other airlines. And what I said to them was: You use your commercial airlines to move terrorists and weapons around the Middle East, including to Syria, and we will not issue licenses at the expense of our national security. And so I encouraged them to make the kind of reforms to their civil aviation and to their economy that would then put us in a better position. But we are not going to be issuing licenses at the expense of our national security or at the expense of our allies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> That comes from the line of Elise Labott, CNN. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the idea that you just said, that you see that the Iranians are in technical compliance \u2013 and obviously, the Europeans have said the same thing and they don\u2019t want to do a kind of additional supplement to the agreement, but have clearly said to you that they\u2019re willing to work with you on some of these other issues such as the sunset, the ICBM, inspections outside of the contours of a deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering, like, what \u2013 I think this is the basic question that everyone is asking, like what is the point of even withdrawing from the deal if you can deal with these concerns with the Europeans outside of the confines of it? Whereas if you push and you pull out of the deal that they\u2019re not going to work with you on it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then a second part of that is if Iran is in technical compliance of the deal and you\u2019re working towards possible discussions with North Korea on a nuclear deal, what kind of confidence does it give the North Koreans if you\u2019re willing to kind of change the goalposts and say technical compliance is one thing but the spirit of the agreement is another? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks, Elise. I think on the second part, in the context of nonproliferation agreements or treaties, it is very common to add supplemental agreements. START \u2013 New START does not violate START. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a very common practice in arms control to be making adjustments to a nonproliferation agreement as you go along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat\u2019s unique about the JCPOA is that it\u2019s not an arms control treaty. It\u2019s not even an agreement. It\u2019s a plan of action that was agreed to by the prior administration and it doesn\u2019t have the same standing as a treaty would. And so this is a \u2013 I think a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s <em>sui generis</em> nonproliferation plan of action that\u2019s a political document. And this is an agreement that has many deficiencies. We think that these deficiencies are of such threats to national security that we can\u2019t allow the deal to remain in place without a supplemental agreement to address its deficiencies. And so that\u2019s our focus there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of North Korea, when you look at the history of negotiations with North Korea, no one has moved the goalposts or negotiated in more bad faith than North Korea. They have a history of noncompliance, but with the United States, we then stick to the terms of the deal, and we have not had a partner \u2013 we have not had somebody on the other the side of the table in (inaudible) with the Kim family over three generations now who negotiate in good faith. And so we are determined not to make some of the past mistakes again in the context of North Korea, and the maximum pressure campaign continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our next question comes from the line of Michele Kelemen, NPR. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, hi. One quick question about the negotiations with the Europeans: Do you think that whatever supplemental deal is really going to be enough to keep the President inside the JCPOA? And then on this question of the Americans, are you proposing kind of a separate humanitarian channel, is this going to be something more regular, or was this a one-off meeting?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> What we have is the President\u2019s guidance on January 12th where he has explained the conditions that would have to be met to continue waiving sanctions, and those are the instructions we\u2019re operating under. He will have to reach an \u2013 he will have to reach a decision as to \u2013 are we able to \u2013 first we have to reach an agreement with the Europeans, and if we can\u2019t reach an agreement with the Europeans, then we will report that to the President. If we can reach an agreement, then that will be presented to the President by the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor, and then he will make a decision on whether he wants to remain in the deal or stop waiving sanctions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> That comes from the line of Arshad Mohammed of Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for doing this. Has \u2013 have you made any progress in the talks so far with the three European partners on the specific question of the sunsets under the JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: I appreciate you asking the question, but I don\u2019t want to get into the substance of our negotiations. We \u2013 where we have agreement, we are capturing the agreement, and where we have differences, we are working to narrow them to see if we can reach an agreement. And so that\u2019s been the nature of the process. As I\u2019ve said before, we have had very constructive meetings and we are (inaudible) toward reaching an agreement, and we\u2019ll see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Okay. Our next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR</strong>: The next question is from Felicia Schwartz, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Hey, Brian, thanks for doing this. First, should we take your comments earlier on the airline licenses to mean that the Boeing deal is on hold, or perhaps in danger? And then are you discussing contingencies with the Europeans in these meetings at this point if the President does pull out of the deal, since May is not too far away? And what is the status of the legislative fix?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: On the first part about the civil aviation, most of that was related to \u2013 I think that\u2019s related mostly to parts. What I said earlier is not meant to make any commentary or opinion on the other part that you raised. I was just saying that with respect to civil aviation, we are meeting our obligations under the deal in terms of aviation licenses. They have acknowledged that we have not issued any new civil aviation licenses in this administration. The previously issued licenses remain in place, but we never intended to let licensed aircraft contribute to Iran\u2019s regional destabilization effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Felicia, what was the second?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Just \u2013 are you discussing contingencies at this point if the President does decide to pull out, since May is only a few months away? And also, the legislative fix, where does that stand?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: I will defer to Congress on the legislative fix. The President set forth a plan. What the President wants to do is to give Congress a role to address the range of threats that Iran presents. The prior administration did not submit this nonproliferation plan of action to the Senate and bypass the Congress. In this administration, the President is working with the Congress to \u2013 we think one aspect of fixing the Iran deal is giving the role to Congress. The other aspect of it is securing an agreement with our European allies to address its deficiencies. And so those are the \u2013 sort of the two key lines of effort. So that\u2019s really where our focus is.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Okay. We have time for just a couple extra questions. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR</strong>: The next question is from the line of Dave Clark, AFP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Hello, can you hear me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Yep, sure can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Yeah. Hi, Dave Clark here from AFP. I know that our Israeli colleague Barak Ravid is reporting that Israeli officials are saying that President Trump told them that a supplemental agreement would be insufficient, and that he wants the deal itself to be torn up otherwise. He\u2019s thinking of \u2013 he\u2019s thinking of pulling out. I wouldn\u2019t ask you to comment on leaks from another government, but are you clear yourself and are you able to articulate to our European allies what exactly the President\u2019s redlines are? And do you \u2013 are you clear yourself as to what it would take to convince him to stay in the deal? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: Well, I also \u2013 before I answer that, let me just go back to what Felicia asked about contingency planning. The President has, as I said earlier, given us negotiating guidance in his January 12th statement. And so he has asked if we can reach agreement with the Europeans. We always have to prepare for any eventuality, and so we are engaged in contingency planning because it would not be responsible not to engage in it. We are \u2013 we\u2019re kind of dual-tracking this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so on the other question about the meeting with the President, I wouldn\u2019t comment on any sort of discussion that the President had privately with another country. So I don\u2019t really have anything to add there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: And I would --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: No, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: I would just confirm \u2013 excuse me, I would just highlight, Dave, that we haven\u2019t seen that report ourselves from Israel, and so just can\u2019t confirm that that is what anybody from the administration said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: No, but I didn\u2019t ask you to comment on that report, but I just wanted to know if Mr. Hook is himself clear on exactly what the agreement with the Europeans would have to involve for the President to sign off on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK</strong>: The President has identified sunsets, inspections and ICBMs. And so those are the three areas of focus for us, and we have a delegation, a team that is working on this with representatives from the State Department and the White House. We have a very good interagency team that\u2019s working on this to be faithful to the President\u2019s instructions on negotiations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. And we\u2019re going to have to do the last question. Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. I know you had a question, if we can pull you in there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And Nick Wadhams, Bloomberg News, please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks. Can you hear me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yeah, we can hear you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Okay. Can I just ask Brian two quick things? One, how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to reach a deal with the Europeans? Are you hopeful that there is \u2013 that you can cross the finish line on this, or are you skeptical that you\u2019ll be able to reach something?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd also you mentioned that you would need to come to some agreement with the Europeans to present to the President in May. What about Russia, China, and Iran? What if you don\u2019t secure agreement from them before May? Or is the strategy that you would get the European agreement and then take that to the President, and then work on those other parties to the plan of action? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> We have had constructive talks with the Europeans toward a supplemental agreement, but I can\u2019t predict whether we will reach an agreement with them or not. We have a goal in mind, and we either will reach agreement or we won\u2019t.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the second part of the question, the only guidance that we \u2013 that the President gave is to reach an agreement with the E3. And that is the first phase of this, which is through May 12th. And I won\u2019t speculate beyond May 12th, because that is \u2013 that\u2019s as much as our negotiating instructions allow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Thanks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and Brian, thank you for your time. We\u2019ll let you get back to shoveling snow or whatever one does in the suburbs. (Laughter.) The embargo on the call has now been lifted. If anyone has any follow-up questions, PA is staffed, we\u2019re all working, so let us know if you need anything. Brian, thank you, and thank you everybody for your time today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Okay, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay, bye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks so much, everybody. Bye.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "official_name": "Brian Hook",
        "official_title": "Director of Policy Planning",
        "date": "May 18, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s on-the-record conference call with our director of policy planning, Brian Hook. It\u2019s certainly been a busy week with calls and outreach to our allies and partners in which we\u2019ve been discussing our next steps on Iran. Following this, Secretary Pompeo will deliver a speech on Monday to outline the administration\u2019s overall strategy to counter Iran\u2019s malign influence. Director Hook is here to speak with us today in advance of that speech.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a reminder, this briefing is on the record. It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. Brian has just about 10 minutes to take your questions, so I would encourage you to be brief. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Director Hook for some brief opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks, Heather. Good to be with all of you. Just make a few points here. The Secretary \u2013 Secretary Pompeo will be giving a speech on Monday. It will be his first major foreign policy address as Secretary of State. It will be a very timely address because it is presenting the way forward post the Iran nuclear deal withdrawal. And he\u2019ll be essentially presenting a diplomatic roadmap to achieve a new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal, following the President\u2019s decision to end America\u2019s participation in the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary has had very good phone calls with the ministers, the foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We have been working closely with the Europeans over the last week at various levels of government \u2013 the President, the Secretary of State. I\u2019ve been in touch with the political directors of the E3. We\u2019ve had staff discussion. So we have been in very extensive and deep consultations with the Europeans on the way forward. Our broad approach now that we\u2019ve been emphasizing is that we need a new \u2013 a framework that\u2019s going to address the totality of Iran\u2019s threats. And this involves a range of things around its nuclear program \u2013 missiles, proliferating missiles and missile technology, its support for terrorists, and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we see an opportunity to counter and address Iran\u2019s nuclear and proliferation threats, its destabilizing activity, and to create a better nonproliferation and deterrence architecture for Iran and the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\u2019s broadly the way forward. I\u2019m happy to take some questions. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday; that\u2019s only three days away from now. And he looks forward to presenting a comprehensive strategy toward Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll start with our first question. That\u2019s with Josh Lederman from the Associated Press. Hi, Josh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I just wanted to ask you about the prospects of getting other countries, and particularly the Europeans, to join any kind of coalition. I mean, the Europeans are moving ahead with using the blocking statute; they\u2019re even considering direct transfers to Iran\u2019s central bank. So what makes you think they\u2019re going to join you? And if you don\u2019t get the Europeans or actually any of the P5+1 on board, can this coalition still have enough weight to succeed in bringing Iran back to the table? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that we agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on. During the negotiations with the E3, we made a lot of progress not only \u2013 I mean, just on the nuclear piece, on the \u2013 on sunsets, on ICBMs, on a stronger inspections regime, but also on the regional activities, human rights, the range of missiles that are destabilizing the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we, I think, have the very \u2013 I think we assess the situation very similarly in terms of the wanting to take a comprehensive approach. When President Macron was in the United States he talked about the four pillars, and his \u2013 what he was talking about is a very comprehensive approach. And I think for the last many years, the last three years or so, the JCPOA gave a lot of people a sort of false sense of security that by addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, that we were somehow then addressing the totality of Iranian threats. And it\u2019s important that we \u2013 that we change that dynamic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think that, again, we agree on more than we disagree, and we, as I said, have been working with the Europeans over the last week or two, and just in consultations with them, and we want to continue the momentum from our work with our European allies. And we see this, the coming months, as an opportunity to expand our efforts and to work with a lot of countries who share the same concerns about nonproliferation, about terrorism, about stoking civil wars around the region, and so we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re very hopeful about the \u2013 about the diplomacy ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Brian. Next question, Michael Gordon from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Hi, Michael.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Hook, the diplomats in Europe that I\u2019ve spoken with have said that it\u2019s clear the administration wants tough sanctions, but the administration has yet to spell out in any detail what it \u2013 the arrangements that it thinks should be put in place now that the JCPOA has been scrapped. What specific nuclear constraints do you think are necessary post-JCPOA in the sphere of enrichment or other nuclear activities? And if you can\u2019t say what you want in terms of nuclear constraints, how can you ask the Europeans to impose tough sanctions? You\u2019re asking them to impose tough sanctions but you\u2019ve not defined your goal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think, Michael, that\u2019s part of the reason why the Secretary is giving a speech on Monday. But Brian, I\u2019ll let you take it from here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, that is \u2013 this is \u2013 as I said, this will be the Secretary\u2019s first major foreign policy address. He has decided to make that on Iran. And we will be discussing our vision to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has had a definite military dimension to it, and the Iranians have yet to come clean on the military dimensions of their nuclear activities. That is going to be part \u2013 I mean, obviously with what Israel disclosed recently, that Iran has been protecting and preserving a vast atomic archive while it has been implementing the JCPOA, and of course that increases the relevance of the sunsets. We don\u2019t believe that Iran has earned the trust of the world to have restrictions on its nuclear program lifted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Carol \u2013 sorry, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, go ahead, Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Carol Morello from <i>The Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing this. Say, Donald Tusk said some pretty strong things a couple of days ago about the administration. Basically, I think he said: With friends like this, who needs enemies? But at least we now know if you need a helping hand, you don\u2019t have to go farther than the end of your arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I was wondering what, if anything, that Secretary Pompeo will be doing to address the lingering resentment over Iran. I realize that\u2019s not the only issue, but that\u2019s certainly one. And also, if you could address a little bit of what kind of negotiation do you see with Iran. You seem to be seeking a surrender on their part, not a negotiation. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah. The President expressed his appreciation to our European partners. And we have worked, tried to fix the significant flaws in the nuclear deal to counter Iranian aggression. He believes very strongly in supporting the Iranian people. We believe that our shared values and commitment to confront sort of the common security challenges will transcend any disagreements over the JCPOA. And we weren\u2019t able to bridge all the gaps between our respective views on the JCPOA. We think that we\u2019ve been able to make a lot of progress on the range of issues on the nuclear and security sort of objectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture, a new framework, and I think that, again, people, I think, are overstating the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Brian, thanks. Lesley Wroughton from Reuters is next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, hi, Brian. I kind of want to come back to what the others are trying to say, because at a time when \u2013 a sensitive time when you\u2019re actually trying to get Iran to be part of discussions, it seems that you\u2019re pushing them away. How does one convince them through this new architecture that it\u2019s to their benefit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Well, you\u2019ve seen the protests in Iran, and you\u2019ve seen their dissatisfaction with \u2013 I think the Iranian people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime which have not helped the Iranian people. The President has spoken very eloquently about the concerns of the Iranian people. And so we \u2013 the President has said \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if it was the President said it or \u2013 but we have said that we are ready to negotiate a better deal, and there are a range of nations that can be a part of that. We certainly have the folks within the JCPOA, but we think there are other countries that also share these concerns, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, last question is Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. Hey, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Brian, do you have a timeframe for how long the U.S. would like this next round of negotiations to occur? At what point would the U.S. just say this is not going to happen? And can you also draw a parallel to North Korea? One of the things the administration has said about why North Korea came to the table was this maximum pressure campaign that left it so isolated diplomatically and economically. Do you believe that you could obtain the same scenario with Iran, that you would be able to create a similarly sort of airtight sanctions regime again with them?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK: </b>With the \u2013 by reimposing the sanctions that were lifted under the JCPOA, that will bring economic pressure to bear on Iran. It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago. We very much want a diplomatic outcome, one that is going to increase the security of the American people. We thought that the JCPOA provided too much in return for too little, and we also thought that it had very strong deficiencies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are going to be very focused on trying to achieve the President\u2019s national security objectives, and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions is part of our diplomatic strategy to try to achieve a better security architecture. And so the goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be discussing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe very much want to be \u2013 have a very kind of up-tempo diplomacy, one that\u2019s very focused and very determined to achieve our national security objectives. And Secretary Pompeo is committed to spending as much time as necessary with his team to achieve our goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, everyone, we have to wrap it up. Brian, thank you so much for your time. Everyone, thanks for calling in. We look forward to having as many of you join us for the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday. I believe we\u2019ll be sending out a formal announcement if we haven\u2019t already. So we look forward to talking with you. The embargo has now been lifted. And have a great weekend, everyone. Brian, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "date": "February 13, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<span><span>We, the Foreign Ministers and principals of the Global Coalition, have come together in Kuwait City united in our determination to defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh through a focused, sustained, multifaceted effort. We know our enemy: ISIS/Da\u2019esh is intrinsically malevolent, celebrates cruelty, systematically violates international law and regularly commits gross abuses of human rights. Yet three and a half years into this effort, ISIS/Da\u2019esh stands undeniably degraded \u2013 it has lost its territorial hold in Iraq and only a few pockets of land remain under its control in Syria. Its leadership, on-line presence and global networks are under pressure. But our work is not done. ISIS/Da\u2019esh remains a serious threat to the stability of the region and to our common security. Enduring defeat will come when ISIS/Da\u2019esh no longer has safe havens from which to operate; when it no longer poses a threat to our homelands; and when it can no longer convey its ideology of hate globally. Recognizing that we are at an inflection point, where we must sustain attention to Iraq and Syria to secure our significant gains, while simultaneously adapting our footing to curb ISIS/Daesh\u2019s global ambitions, we offer these Guiding Principles as our vision for the future of this Coalition.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ultimately to achieve a full and enduring defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh, the Coalition will fully eliminate ISIS/Da\u2019esh as a territorial threat in Iraq and Syria and stabilize liberated communities in an inclusive manner. We will mobilize Coalition members and external partners, using a whole-of-government approach, to disrupt ISIS/Da\u2019esh networks and its branches and affiliates, including possible new manifestations and variants, and deny its freedom of movement, safe havens, and access to resources in accordance with and in support of UNSCR 2396. We will combat ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s ideology to prevent its reemergence, recruitment, and expansion. We will support local voices that offer an alternative vision to ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s propaganda, and we will redouble our efforts to deny ISIS/Da\u2019esh space to exploit social media and the Internet. We will work to consolidate our gains to date and prevent a re-emergence of ISIS/Da\u2019esh by supporting Iraqi-led political and security sector reforms, and, through UNSCR 2254, committing to reach a political solution in Syria, thus helping to address root causes for the appearance of ISIS/Da\u2019esh.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Our approach rests on a number of key pillars. First, we see this Coalition as a mobilizing and coordinating mechanism nested in a much larger diplomatic, military and counterterrorism ecosystem, in accordance with the principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and relevant Security Council Resolutions. Second, we recognize nations bear primary responsibility for defending their homelands against ISIS/Da\u2019esh; our Coalition must work by, with, and through our partners. Third, membership in this Coalition is voluntary, as are the contributions each of us makes to this effort. Fourth and finally, we agree there is no single approach to the defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2013 each one is tailored to address the unique nature of the threat in a given country or region \u2013 importantly, most approaches to ISIS/Da\u2019esh globally will not mirror our efforts in Iraq and Syria, where Coalition-led military action has been central. That said, we agree there is great utility in sustaining collaboration and unity of purpose across the Coalition against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and ISIS-related threats on a global scale.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At the heart of our collaboration are the Coalition\u2019s Working Groups, and each one has a unique path forward. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Counter-Finance Working Group (CIFG) focuses on identifying and disrupting ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s ability to generate revenue and access the regional and international financial systems. As ISIS/Da\u2019esh adapts in response to its territorial losses in Iraq and Syria, the CIFG will adapt with it, leveraging its collaboration with like-minded multilateral organizations and encouraging members to take more concrete actions against ISIS/Da\u2019esh financing.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Foreign Terrorist Fighter Working Group (FTF WG) focuses on supporting and encouraging preventive, counter-terrorism-related information sharing through appropriate bilateral and collective law enforcement channels (such as Interpol), rehabilitation/reintegration, law enforcement and legal/criminal justice actions to mitigate the FTF threat (including FTF and their families returning, relocating and resurfacing). The FTF WG will continue to serve as a platform for an international whole-of-government approach, enhancing collaboration and capacity building within and across disciplines and seeking close connections and where possible integration with relevant international CT structures such as the Global Counterterrorism Forum.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Communications Working Group seeks to contest the information space in which ISIS/Da\u2019esh operates and to ensure that the contraction of the group\u2019s territory is followed by its ideological defeat. It co-ordinates and coalesces the strategic communications approaches of Coalition members; fosters external partnerships to amplify the reach and impact of the international community\u2019s efforts to degrade ISIS/Da\u2019esh propaganda; and it builds resilience in vulnerable audiences \u2013 all aimed at reducing ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s capability to use propaganda to recruit, and to incite and inspire violence. We will share expertise and best practice to tackle future propaganda threats from other violent extremist organizations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Working Group on Stabilization plays a central role coordinating and promoting international stabilization efforts in Iraq and, where possible, in Syria. Successful IDP return is essential to consolidate the military defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh. In the course of 2018, as stabilization work in Iraq begins to conclude, the group will also assist the Iraqi Government's efforts to secure the significant military gains against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and prevent new violence in liberated areas by supporting the transition from stabilization to sustainable reconstruction. At the same time, the Police Training Sub Group will strengthen its focus on \u201cblue training\u201d and support the Iraqi government\u2019s efforts to restructure the Federal police and create a civilian police force that represents and is trusted by all citizens in Iraq. In Syria, the Working Group on Stabilization will coordinate and promote stabilization efforts with the aim of strengthening credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, in accordance with and in support of UNSCR 2254.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The defense aspects of the Coalition also will continue to evolve as the nature of the threat changes and the Coalition increasingly focuses on ISIS/Da\u2019esh networks and branches. As with the Coalition's Foreign Ministers, Defense Ministries also will continue to coordinate regularly on how best to address the threat. The Coalition will pursue its military commitment in Iraq and Syria, and the existing Coalition Force Command in Tampa will continue to support the efforts in the region, in order to secure and stabilize the liberated areas to help retain our significant successes against ISIS/Da\u2019esh to date.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Across lines of effort, we will work to ensure women and women\u2019s organizations are fully and actively engaged and included in peacebuilding and stabilization efforts, in accordance with UNSCR 2242, and will seek to ensure our policies and practices are gender-informed and guided by international legal frameworks.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh was founded in September 2014 based on the worldwide concern over ISIS/Da\u2019esh and the threat it poses to international peace and security. The Coalition has made enormous progress since then, but our work is not done. Looking ahead, we recognize the need to remain alert to the inevitable evolution of the ISIS/Da\u2019esh threat, and to flexibly adapt our response, including through existing multilateral and regional counterterrorism and CVE institutions. We will revisit these Guiding Principles as appropriate. We recognize that the Coalition and its Working Groups serve to focus the international community\u2019s attention on countering the global/transnational threat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh. With that in mind, the Coalition should look to share its expertise into international counterterrorism efforts wherever possible, with an eye to a time in the future when the international community is confident it has the tools to address and neutralize ISIS/Da\u2019esh and ISIS-related threats.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And this is obvious through the ongoing collaboration and cooperation between the members of the coalition to defeat any kind of terrorism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn this occasion, I would like to reiterate my heartfelt congratulations to the Iraqi people on their victory, the historic victory and the liberation of their country from ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the amount of effort exerted by Iraq and the rest of the member countries in the global coalition in their war against so-called ISIS, and these efforts actually culminated in liberating Iraq from ISIS. Today, we are required to continue exerting efforts in times of peace just like we did in times of war.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStemming from this fact, the state of Kuwait has announced, upon the initiative of His Highness Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the emir of the state of Kuwait, may God protect him, it has announced the holding of the Kuwait International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq, which will be taking place alongside this current meeting in an effort to preserve the stability, security, and unity, as well as territorial integrity, of Iraq. This is an effort to pave the way and to find the favorable conditions to start the reconstruction of that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, despite the very positive developments and outcomes that we have achieved on the ground, the international community continues to face a direct threat by armed terrorist groups. And this is why it is a fair amount important for our coalition to continue exerting international efforts and to continue coordinating jointly to fight terrorism and to further develop the strategy set forth by the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this framework, we are full of hope that the efforts of the Government of Iraq will succeed and will be fruitful in holding the perpetrators of terrorist acts accountable, to avoid any impunity. And this should happen according to the UN mechanisms as reflected in the resolution, in the Security Council Resolution 237 of the year 2017. And also we need to exert or to step up the experience of Iraq in terms of judicial capabilities to \u2013 in this regard, and we need to continue working to stem the flow of terrorist \u2013 foreign terrorist fighters, in accordance to international resolutions 2396, 2253, 2199, 2178, and 2170.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, as part of its responsibilities in the Global Coalition Against ISIS, the state of Kuwait has hosted five international conferences to fight terrorism, and these include the Stabilization Working Group meeting, the meeting of the Small Group of the Global Coalition, the special meeting of the Counter-Messaging Working Group, the meeting of the Preventing Terrorism Financing Working Group, in addition to the meeting on preventing the flow of terrorists and foreign fighters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the end, I wish to welcome you once again in the state of Kuwait, and I hope that this meeting will be a successful one and will be a continuation of the many successes achieved by the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. And we hope that we will come up with recommendations and strategies that we can implement on the ground in an effort to protect the international community from extremism and terrorism. Thank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI now have the honor of giving the floor to my friend and colleague, the U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Rex Tillerson. The floor is yours, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Good morning, and thank you, Excellencies, Minister al-Sabah, for the \u2013 for welcoming me today, and I want to also greet excellencies, colleagues, and friends of the coalition. I appreciate the opportunity to address you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt has been approximately three and a half years since the global coalition began its effort to defeat ISIS. At the time we started our efforts, ISIS/Daesh was thriving. Today, ISIS/Daesh is failed. Approximately 98 percent of the territory once held by ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been liberated. Approximately 3.2 million Syrians and 4.5 million Iraqis have been freed from the tyranny of ISIS. Over 3.2 million internally displaced Iraqis are now back home. ISIS\u2019s leadership, online presence, and global network are under more pressure than ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the end of major combat operations does not mean that we have achieved the enduring defeat of ISIS. ISIS remains a serious threat to the stability of the region, our homelands, and other parts of the globe. Without continued attention on the part of coalition members, we risk the return of extremist groups like ISIS in liberated areas in Iraq and Syria and their spread to new locations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEach of us must continue our commitment to the complete defeat of ISIS. Maintaining stabilization initiatives is essential in this regard. If communities in Iraq and Syria cannot return to normal life, we risk the return of conditions that allowed ISIS to take and control vast territory. We must continue to clear unexploded remnants of war left behind by ISIS, enable hospitals to reopen, restore water and electricity services, and get boys and girls back in school.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, it is critical that the funding facility for stabilization be fully funded in this, its final year, in order to ensure the stabilization initiatives led by the Government of Iraq can be well-positioned to prevent a resurgence of ISIS. The United States appreciates the generous contributions of coalition members over the past year, but we all must do our part to ensure that (inaudible) stabilization (inaudible) in Mosul City, western Anbar, western Nineveh, and (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, the United States continues to be the world\u2019s largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian crisis. At the end of January we provided more than $216 million in new funding, bringing our total humanitarian assistance to nearly $7.7 billion since the start of the crisis. Today, I am announcing that we are providing an additional $200 million to further support critical stabilization and early recovery initiatives in liberated areas of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo ensure an enduring defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, we are working with the global coalition and local partners to consolidate military gains. Home forces are essential to securing liberated areas and setting the conditions for safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States will maintain a conditions-based and ISIS-focused military presence in Syria. As part of that presence, we will continue to train local security forces in Syria. We are also working to ensure the local forces we train are effective, professional, accountable, and respectful of human rights. It is essential that these forces be representative of their local communities and do not pose a threat to neighboring communities or neighboring countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, we remain concerned over recent events in northwest Syria and call on all parties to remain focused on defeating ISIS, de-escalating and resolving the Syrian conflict, and protecting innocent civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe are keenly aware of the legitimate security concerns of Turkey, our coalition partner and NATO ally. We will continue to be completely transparent with Turkey about our efforts in Syria to defeat ISIS, and we stand by our NATO ally in its counterterrorism efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs ISIS continues to evolve, so must the coalition. (Inaudible) ISIS is attempting to morph into an insurgency in places like Afghanistan, the Philippines, Libya, West Africa, and others, and is trying to carve our and secure safe havens. We have seen in Iraq and Syria the consequences of an ISIS territorial threat. History must not be allowed to repeat itself elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs ISIS fighters (inaudible) Security Council Resolution 2396 is a new and effective tool for countering threats posed by foreign terrorist fighters. The United States calls for quick implementation and full enforcement of the resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLastly, we must keep up the pace of combatting ISIS as it continually seeks to radicalize, recruit, and direct operations online. We must be aggressive in online spaces (inaudible) such as the instant messaging service (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe fight against ISIS will remain difficult. Coalition partners must call on all international powers to eradicate this threat. Every one of us must continue to adapt and strengthen our coalition through counter-ISIS\u2019s own network of foreign fighters, financing, and propaganda. And we must continue to deepen our partnerships in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States supports the revised guiding principles being presented today. They reaffirm our common determination to continue our efforts until we have achieved the full and enduring defeat of ISIS. And they (inaudible) our vision (inaudible) the coalition and our ongoing cooperative efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the opening line of the guiding principle says, \u201cWe are,\u201d and I quote, \u201cunited in our determination to defeat ISIS/Daesh through a focused, sustained, and multifaceted effort.\u201d It is now our duty to keep taking action that reflects that determination. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m also very pleased to be with Foreign Minister Shoukry, who has become a friend as we have engaged on a number of challenges in the region and to address those jointly and with a great deal of agreement between us as to how those issues need to be addressed. I look forward to my meeting with President al-Sisi and appreciate his receiving me as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a very productive discussion on our shared regional and security concerns. We spoke about opportunities as to how to strengthen our ties and, as the foreign minister indicated, mechanisms by which we can deepen those ties and further explore areas for mutual cooperation, first through the strategic dialogue which we\u2019ve agreed we will have later this year, and then we\u2019re going to explore also the possibility of a 2+2 dialogue to even allow us to further enhance these conversations both on a full range of issues of not just security concerns, but political and economic opportunities as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI did express to the foreign minister our condolences to the people of Egypt for the violence that they have been suffering from the terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Egypt\u2019s been battling this level of extremism for many years, and we continue to be steadfast partners in their response to these attacks throughout this time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe agreed that we would continue our close cooperation on counterterrorism measures, including our joint commitment to the defeat of ISIS, and Egypt has been a very important member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition from the beginning. They \u2013 Egypt deals with the threats of ISIS themselves and are dealing with it certainly currently in the Sinai.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also discussed the importance of the protection and promotion of human rights and the vital role of civil society in Egypt. With the presidential elections planned for the end of March, the United States, as it does in all countries, supports a transparent and credible electoral process, and all citizens being given the right and the opportunity to participate freely and fairly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn Libya, the United States and Egypt support the UN\u2019s Action Plan for Libya for credible and peaceful elections in their country. This will promote stability \u2013 much-needed stability for Libya and their economy to prosper. As the Security Council affirmed on December the 14th, the Libyan Political Agreement in our view must remain the framework for a political solution throughout Libya\u2019s transitional period.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tForeign Minister Shoukry and I also discussed Syria and how we can work together to reinforce the UN-led Geneva political process, which is the only political framework through which this conflict can be resolved. And Egypt has played a very important role in supporting dialogue between opposition representatives and the central government in Damascus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Middle East peace, I reiterated that the Trump administration remains committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, the foreign minister and I also discussed how we can intensify our countries\u2019 economic engagement and support our private sectors to generate jobs and prosperity for both of our people, and I acknowledged and welcomed the very important \u2013 although we know difficult \u2013 steps towards reform that President Sisi has undertaken in order to create a very strong foundation for future prosperity and economic performance in Egypt, and those have been necessary, although difficult, to be fully \u2013 receive the full support of the IMF, and Egypt has met all of those requirements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll do what we can to continue to encourage the economic recovery and we hope that American companies are able to increase their investments in Egypt that will create jobs and opportunities here as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, again, commits itself to standing with Egypt, standing shoulder to shoulder in these \u2013 in the fight against terrorism, but also standing together to create a more stable region for everyone as well, and I thank the foreign minister for our opportunity to meet and exchange on so many important issues. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think the commitment the U.S. has to Egypt\u2019s security in the fight against terrorism should be evident, and both with the release of about a billion dollars of foreign military financing assistance to Egypt to continue to strengthen its capabilities, and also sharing of other approaches to countering terrorism, some of which we can talk about, some of which we can\u2019t so easily talk about. But our joint commitment to defeat ISIS is steadfast and there has been no gap between Egypt and the United States in our joint efforts to confront terrorists and extremist \u2013 extremism in the region, but most specifically here in Egypt as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think the Egyptian people should be confident that the U.S. commitment to continuing to support Egypt in this fight against terrorism, in bringing security for the Egyptian people is steadfast, and that will continue, and we had a great deal of exchange today about how we can advance that. And we just mentioned the intent to have a strategic dialogue later this year. All of these are opportunities for us to identify other ways that we can strengthen and support Egypt\u2019s fight against terrorism, but also, ultimately, to strengthen the economic development of Egypt as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.) Carol, <i>Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Mr. Secretary, given the concerns (inaudible) to run against the president (inaudible) election and who were arrested and disqualified, how (inaudible) do you believe those elections will be? And will the United States consider withholding more military aid from Egypt (inaudible)?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, sir, human rights groups have called this the most repressive era in modern Egyptian history. What did Secretary Tillerson tell you about democracy and civil liberty here in Egypt? And will anything change here in Egypt after your meeting today? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think as I indicated in my prepared remarks, and I would answer the same: We have always advocated for free and fair elections, transparent elections, not just for Egypt but in any country. And so the U.S. is always going to advocate for an electoral process that respects the rights of its citizens to make the choices the citizens want to make and the full participation of citizens in those elections. And nothing has changed about our advocacy for those types of elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY: </strong>As relates to some of the comments that have been made by certain members of the human rights community and other activists, I would only recommend that you ascertain for yourself the nature and the current situation in Egypt as relates to human rights, and how the Egyptian people view this administration and its efforts to strengthen and protect human rights, and whether there is that sense of restriction that you alluded to. I think it is \u2013 it isn\u2019t helpful that a certain group projects from a perspective of lack of information, lack of direct association to a society, but it is much, much more important the general conditions, the freedom of press that is available, the variety of television shows, the dialogue and the exchange. Development in the social and political field is an evolutionary process. I think over the last 11 years, the Egyptian people have shown their commitment and their determination and their ability to change their course and to indicate their dissatisfaction. If they deemed that they were dissatisfied, they have been able to change two governments in the last seven years, and they have undertaken legislative elections and know how to protect their rights and to advocate for those rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s important that I think we recognize that it is the Egyptian people who should determine how they are applying their freedoms and their political activism, and I hope that you will have the opportunity while you\u2019re here in Egypt to discuss this with the Egyptians on the street and ascertain from them directly whether they are satisfied with current conditions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a discussion with the Secretary related to Egypt\u2019s efforts to develop both politically, economically, and socially, and that we continue to do so out of our desire to see Egypt evolve into a place of \u2013 that can fulfill the aspirations of its people, and we will continue to rely on the support that we can depend on from the United States in this regard. These are commitments that this administration is confident it will fulfill, and it is responsible to the Egyptian people to continue to fulfill those commitments, as has been stipulated in our constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think it\u2019s important to note that in the announcement President Trump made regarding Jerusalem he also made two very important points as well, one of which was he was not advocating for any change to the status quo as to oversight of the holy sites, recognizing the proper role of existing authorities; and the second is that the final boundaries of Jerusalem are yet to be determined, and that those will be decided among the parties. And those \u2013 I think it\u2019s oftentimes those two important points seem to have been overlooked in his announcement. And yes, the U.S. is still committed to the peace process and still believes we have an important role to play in bringing the parties together and seeing a resolution to this. And President Trump is committed to that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.) <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, Felicia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Secretary Tillerson, Vice President Pence, in an interview with <i>The Washington Post</i>, endorsed what you\u2019ve described publicly as talks about talks with the North Koreans, and president \u2013 South Korea\u2019s President Moon said he would go to Pyongyang. Is this the start of a diplomatic process in North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then for Foreign Minister Shoukry, the U.S. has in the past raised concerns about Egypt\u2019s ties with North Korea. What is Egypt doing to cut those ties?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> I\u2019m not sure I could hear the last part of your question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was just asking if this \u2013 is this the start of a diplomatic process with North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as to \u2013 as to the Vice President\u2019s comments about potentially having talks and whether it\u2019s the start of a diplomatic process, I think it\u2019s too early to judge. As we\u2019ve said for some time, it\u2019s really up to the North Koreans to decide when they\u2019re ready to engage with us in a sincere way, a meaningful way. They know what has to be on the table for conversations. We\u2019ve said for some time that I think it\u2019s important that we have \u2013 we\u2019re going to need to have some discussions that precede any form of negotiation to determine whether the parties are, in fact, ready to engage in something this meaningful, in order for us to then put together the construct of a negotiation. So we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> We did discuss with Secretary Tillerson the issues related to North Korea, the Korean Peninsula, and the security of that region. Egypt has had normal diplomatic ties with North Korea, as does many Western and NATO members, and those ties are, in terms of the relationship, limited to representation, and there is almost no existing economic or other areas of cooperation. But we are concerned with the current status with the threats emanating from the proliferation of nuclear weapons, a situation which we deem as threatening to the global nonproliferation regime, one that has to be dealt within our maintaining global security, also the threats of ballistic missile systems to South Korea and to Japan, and we believe that all of these issues must be resolved for the security of the region and the Korean Peninsula. And we will continue to discuss these issues and to take the appropriate measures to deal with these challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And thank you for joining us today for a background call to preview Secretary Tillerson\u2019s upcoming to travel to Amman, Ankara, Beirut, Cairo, and Kuwait City. We are joined today by [Senior State Department Official One], [Senior State Department Official Two], [Senior State Department Official Three], [Senior State Department Official Four], and [Senior State Department Official Five]. These officials will be known now as Senior Department Officials One, Two, Three, Four, and Five respectively. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is on background and will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. With that, I\u2019m happy to now turn it over to our first speaker who will begin \u2013 who will brief us on the Secretary\u2019s travel to Amman. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Hi, folks. Senior Department Official One here with you. So as you know, part of the visit to \u2013 on this trip is going to involve a trip to Amman, Jordan. It\u2019s something that Secretary Tillerson had been planning on doing for quite a long time. When he\u2019s there he\u2019ll meet, obviously, with King Abdullah and with Foreign Minister Safadi. He\u2019ll pay a visit to the U.S. embassy, including a new annex that will be reopened there \u2013 that will be opened there soon. And he\u2019ll do a visit with the U.S. embassy staff, one of our largest teams in the Middle East. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the purpose of the visit, and recall that this visit comes on the heels of a very successful visit by Vice President Pence only a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s really a marker of the longstanding and enduring strength of our U.S.-Jordan partnership. At the center of the visit is going to be conclusion \u2013 Secretary Tillerson and his counterpart Foreign Minister Safadi \u2013 conclusion of a bilateral MOU that enshrines our commitment to cooperate on a whole range of bilateral assistance priorities \u2013 economic, defense, security \u2013 over the coming years. The details of that MOU we will leave for the actual signing when the team is in Jordan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the visit of the Secretary to Jordan will highlight our cooperation with the Jordanians on a whole range of issues \u2013 their work with us resolving the conflict in Syria, the defeat of ISIS and other terrorist groups, and our work \u2013 continuing work to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, including Israeli-Palestinian peace. Obviously, the Secretary will convey our assistance and understanding and support for Jordan as they host upwards of 650,000 refugees, and our commitment to supporting Jordan\u2019s efforts to manage the refugee influx while implementing reforms designed to stimulate Jordan\u2019s economy, promote private sector-led growth, and renewable energy in Jordan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Now we\u2019ll take a preview of the trip to Ankara.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> So Secretary Tillerson\u2019s visit to Ankara is the next step in a series of high-level telephone and in-person engagements we\u2019ve had with senior Turkish leadership, the purpose of which is really to reaffirm the value of our alliance with Turkey and the shared interests that we face as we try and work through a range of these challenges together. The Secretary obviously plans to raise some of the more difficult issues in the bilateral relationship as well as some of the things that are going better. And then he\u2019ll also, of course, discuss the full range of regional and security issues, from the defeat ISIS campaign to counter PKK and so forth. We don\u2019t have a full, final schedule yet in terms of who the Secretary will meet exactly when, but he will be meeting with senior level Turkish officials and have some internal meetings at the embassy as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right, thank you very much. And now we\u2019ll go back to Senior Department Official Number One to preview Beirut.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> So again, as part of the visit, the Secretary\u2019s going to visit Beirut. This is the first time a Secretary of State has been to Beirut in four years. And obviously, the center of that visit, he\u2019ll meet with President Aoun, with Prime Minister Saad Hariri, and with the speaker of the parliament, Nabih Berri. It\u2019s really an opportunity to affirm our support for Lebanon as it confronts a whole range of challenges \u2013 defending its borders from terrorists, coping with extraordinary influx of refugees, upwards of a million refugees since the start of the Syrian war. And the visit will also underscore our commitment to Lebanese national institutions, principally the Lebanese Armed Forces and internal security forces in Lebanon, as those forces fight ISIS, al-Qaida, and maintain Lebanon\u2019s stability.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>He\u2019ll obviously also raise the question \u2013 the issue of Hizballah, the destructive role that Hizballah plays in Lebanon and across the region. It\u2019s obviously unacceptable that a militia like Hizballah continues to operate outside the authority of the Lebanese state, and that will be a major topic of discussion between him and Lebanon\u2019s leaders. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And now we\u2019ll take a preview of Cairo.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> So Egypt\u2019s a key strategic partner for us in the region, and the Secretary\u2019s visit to Cairo is an opportunity for him to further build upon the strengthening of the relationship that has occurred over the past year in the array of senior level engagement that there has been \u2013 most recently the Vice President\u2019s visit just a few weeks ago.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary will meet with Egyptian President al-Sisi, his counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, and he\u2019ll also visit the U.S. embassy and meet with U.S. embassy staff.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Building on the Vice President\u2019s recent, very successful visit to Cairo, the Secretary will discuss a range of issues with the Egyptians, including regional issues of mutual concern such as Libya and Syria, our shared commitment to fighting terrorism, Israeli-Palestinian issues and our efforts to move the prospects for peace forward, and other topics pertaining to the bilateral relationship and how it can be further strengthened.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And now, finally, a look at Kuwait.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOUR:</strong> The Secretary will visit Kuwait, and his visit there really has four key components. There is a \u2013 as you know, global conference on defeating ISIL that will take place. There is an Iraq reconstruction event that he will participate in. He will have bilateral meetings with the Kuwaiti relationship, and he will have a number of separate bilateral meetings with other non-Kuwaiti leaders who are also in the country for those two events that I mentioned at the top.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>It\u2019s no coincidence that the Secretary will have these types of engagements in Kuwait. Kuwait\u2019s a very strong and steady regional partner; hosts the fourth-largest number of U.S. troops anywhere in the world; has been a strong partner in the counter-ISIL coalition, and is also a leader on humanitarian issues in the region, as evidenced by its strong support for Syrian refugees and other humanitarian events. Kuwait\u2019s also been the mediator of the Gulf crisis, or the Qatar dispute, as it is sometimes called. And when the Secretary is in Kuwait and in his meetings with the Kuwaitis, he will also want to talk about next steps in terms of resolving the U.S. \u2013 sorry, the Qatar dispute, taking advantage of Kuwait\u2019s leadership and mediation. He\u2019ll also talk about recent sale of F/A-18s that the Kuwaitis are purchasing from the United States, which is a $5 billion deal and will bring many jobs to the American defense sector.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right. And lastly --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> So let me just briefly touch upon the counter-ISIS meeting and then very briefly on some of the Iraq reconstruction meeting. So obviously, the defeat of ISIS is one of the President\u2019s top foreign policy priorities, and about a year ago in March, the Secretary gathered all members of our coalition here at the State Department for a pretty historic meeting, and the point of that was really to look ahead at the next year. The focus on that meeting was very heavily on Mosul, which was an ongoing battle at the time, and also Raqqa, which we knew we\u2019d have to get after over the course of the coming year. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At that meeting, we raised about $2.3 billion of critical funding needs. And what that money did over the last year was help ensure that as we completed the military campaign in Mosul and Raqqa, we were also prepared for the humanitarian outgrowth of displaced persons. So in Mosul, for example, we had 1 million IDPs, and every single IDP \u2013 displaced person \u2013 from Mosul received humanitarian assistance and aid.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Over the last year \u2013 and I think it\u2019s also notable at that meeting in September<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, we had most members of the National Security Council, the cabinet here \u2013 Secretary Mattis, Director Coats and others \u2013 to talk about all we had to do to really strangle ISIS. And over the last year, we really accelerated the campaign. About 50 percent of all the gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria came over the last year \u2013 7.7 million people who used to be living under ISIS and are no longer, about 5 million of them were freed from ISIS over the last year. And the return of displaced to territories that used to be held by ISIS also accelerated this past year, 3.2 million Iraqis now back in their homes in areas that used to be controlled by ISIS. So pretty significant progress over the last year, which we want to kind of do a brief look back as we then look ahead. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019ve also added a number of members to the coalition since that gathering in March of last year, and that includes Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, and also NATO. That\u2019s significant because this is not just a fight, of course, in Iraq and Syria; it truly is a global campaign. This is now the largest coalition of its kind in history, with about 74 members, and as the Secretary cohosts this meeting in Kuwait, part of the focus will be making sure we really focus on the global nature of the campaign. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So there will be really two main elements of the meeting in Kuwait \u2013 the counter-ISIS ministerial. First will be focusing on consolidating the gains in Iraq and Syria, a heavy focus on stabilization and some funding gaps that we hope to close over the course of the next year. The coalition also importantly will endorse a guiding principles document for what we want to do together over the next year, and that will focus much more on law enforcement intelligence sharing, the very difficult work to make sure that we are catching these people as they cross borders, and doing all we can to protect our homeland. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So not only Iraq and Syria, but a real kind of emphasis over the next year on the global nature of the campaign \u2013 the foreign fighters, counter-messaging, intelligence and law enforcement cooperation. And our CT bureau and Ambassador Sales will be hosting a very important meeting of law enforcement officials from our coalition here next month. So that will be a key theme. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Very briefly, on the Iraq reconstruction conference, the Government of Iraq is working with the Government of Kuwait and the World Bank for this conference. It\u2019ll be held over the course of three days to bring together the donor community, civil society, and the private sector. The first day of the Kuwait reconstruction conference is focused on NGOs; the second day, private sector; and the third day, a meeting of government leaders. So Secretary Tillerson and other high level government representatives will attend the event, along with a really unprecedented 2,300 private sector representatives, high-ranking officials from regional governments, and representatives from international financial institutions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>There will be about a hundred American companies traveling to Kuwait for this event, and I think what you will see is a really innovative approach in terms of long-term post conflict reconstruction. And if you think of the template of these two meetings, the counter-ISIS meeting is focused on the immediate stabilization needs, and the reconstruction meeting is looking longer term. And this is not a program of direct U.S. Government contribution to projects; this is rather a more innovative approach focused on long-term financing, improving Iraq\u2019s macroeconomic stability, which we\u2019ve been doing through the IMF and the World Bank and others, to make sure that they are able to finance their long-term reconstruction needs. And I think there will be some fairly significant announcements coming out of those meetings, which I \u2013 which I won\u2019t get ahead of the Secretary, but that\u2019ll be quite important.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And back to the moderator.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>All right, thank you very much, and we\u2019ll now open this up for questions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone phone, *1. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating you\u2019ve been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the # key. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press *1 at this time. One moment, please, for the first question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Lee with AP. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi there, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve got three, but they\u2019re very brief. First of all, this trip, the Secretary\u2019s going to three of Israel\u2019s four neighbors. I\u2019m just curious as to why he is not going to Israel, particularly since the Kuwait stop seems to focus on the fourth of Israel\u2019s neighbor. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Secondly, [Senior State Department Official Five], on the announcements in Kuwait, I realize you don\u2019t want to get into specifics, but those would be private sector announcements or IMF/ World Bank types? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And the last one, for SAO One, [Senior State Department Official One], the MOU in Jordan \u2013 has there been any thought given to moving some of the UNRWA money that\u2019s on hold now to either Jordan or Lebanon to help them deal with whatever shortfall there might be for the Palestinians in both those countries? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> So, Matt, I\u2019ll take my two questions together. On the question of Israel, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fact that there\u2019s no Israel stop. These are always very complicated itineraries to pull together. The Secretary meets relatively frequently with Israeli officials when they\u2019re in town and stays abreast of the issues. So I wouldn\u2019t reach any conclusions about the fact that there\u2019s no Israel stop on this particular trip. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On the question of UNRWA, the MOU doesn\u2019t really deal with UNRWA money, although I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 I don\u2019t think that was your point. But the whole question of how we handle UNRWA funds in general, and then specifically for a country like Jordan, is something we\u2019re studying right now, at the White House particularly. And we\u2019ll reach some conclusions and formula on that soon I believe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE: </strong>Yeah, just briefly. So the IMF program, the Iraqis concluded a standby arrangement with the IMF, which we have \u2013 we\u2019re of course very much a part of helping facilitate. And that\u2019s delivered already about $2 billion in financing and projected to result in about $5.4 billion in budgetary support. That\u2019s the type of stuff that is far more important than the direct \u2013 than the direct contributions. We\u2019ve also provided a sovereign loan guarantee, which helped the Iraqis have a very successful billion-dollar unsupported bond sale back earlier last summer in August. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are the types of things that we\u2019re really focused on here. So working with EXIM Bank and OPIC and others and the private sector to have a more kind of really innovated approach working very closely with the Iraqi Government and its reforms and the World Bank, and its kind of vision over the next couple decades for how it intends to reconstruct and finance its reconstruction. So that\u2019s the focus of the meeting, and I think it will be quite interesting for those who follow these types of issues.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Also just finally, we\u2019ve done a lot of work in the region. Obviously, Secretary Tillerson was very focused early on on the opening between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The Secretary was in Saudi Arabia about three or four months ago for a pretty historic meeting King Salman and Prime Minister Abadi. And since then, we\u2019ve seen the opening of border crossings between Iraq and Saudi Arabia that have been closed for three decades, direct flights between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. And again, those are the types of things that are critical to Iraq\u2019s long-term reconstruction needs, and we look forward to of course seeing the Saudis at the meeting here in Kuwait over the coming days.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong> Thank you. Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Our next question comes from the line of Arshad Mohammed with Reuters. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good morning. Two topics I wanted to raise. One, with regard to Turkey, is the Secretary going to seek a commitment from the Turkish Government not to continue onto Manbij in its activities or its intervention in northern Turkey? And if he is not going to seek such an explicit commitment, is he going to seek at least some kind of commitment to pull back or restrain those activities by the Turks? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then secondly, for official number two, you made no explicit mention of the human rights situation in Egypt and the deterioration in that during Sisi\u2019s rule. And I wonder if you are going to explicitly raise those issues, and particularly, the issues of trying to achieve a fully free and fair election environment in a country where, as you\u2019re well aware, the \u2013 one of the main challengers to President Sisi was effectively prevented from appealing his disqualification because his lawyer got beaten up on the way to launch that appeal.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>So on your first question, I think what we\u2019ve said to the Turks in privately \u2013 in private has been exactly what we\u2019ve said to them in public, which is: we are urging them to show restraint in their operations in Efrin, and to show restraint further along the line across the border in northern Syria. Obviously, we need to work with the Turks to figure out more about what their long-term intentions are, and we need to work with the Turks more to figure out a way if there\u2019s a way that we can \u2013 that we can work with them to address their legitimate security concerns while, at the same time, minimizing civilian casualties and above all else keeping everything focused on the defeat ISIS fight, which is not over. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So that\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation. Turkish rhetoric has obviously been very hot on this topic, and so that\u2019s part of the value of going out, sitting down face to face, and talking through what our potential areas for cooperation are and what hard messages we need to give to them about restraint and focus. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>In terms of Egypt, concerns about human rights and civil society are a topic of continuing conversation with the Egyptians, and I imagine will be a topic that will be discussed on this upcoming visit. On the elections, we support a genuine and a credible electoral process, and we believe should guarantee the right for all citizens to participate freely and fairly. As we do around the world, we urge the Egyptian Government to respect freedom of expression, which is a fundamental pillar for any democratic society. And we have noted our concerns about the reports that Egypt\u2019s prosecutor general has launched an investigation into opposition figures ahead of the March 26th through 28th elections. These types of issues will be discussed on this visit.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Our next question comes from Carol Morello with <em>Washington Post</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I was just looking for a little more detail on both countries you\u2019ve already discussed. In Turkey, given that relationships \u2013 the relationship seems really near the breaking point, where does the Secretary see room to ease tension and for things to improve, given that the government allied press is calling the United States the enemy. And while he\u2019s there, does \u2013 given that Turkey has spoken with Iranian leaders recently, does he have any intention to talk about prisoners or a prisoner swap?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah, I mean, you\u2019re right to point out that particularly the issue of \u2013 particularly the issue of human rights and the arrest of our citizens and our locally engaged staff, that\u2019s first on the agenda on the bilateral package, and there\u2019s no pulling punches on that. We\u2019ve been very public in our call to the Turks to let these folks go, and we\u2019ve been very firm in our private conversations with them as well. That\u2019s an issue that\u2019s going to be a difficult one to work through, but it\u2019s one that we take seriously, because we have no higher priority than the safety of our people overseas. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With regard to the broader bilateral relationship, look, it\u2019s difficult. The rhetoric is hot, the Turks are angry and this is a difficult time to do business, but it\u2019s our belief that there are still some very fundamental underlying shared interests that we have with the Turks, in terms of stability in Syria, defeating ISIS, fighting the PKK and broader questions of regional balance of power, where the Turks play an important role. So, at times like this, engagement is all the more important, but you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our next question comes from Felicia Schwartz with <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks so much for taking the question. One, I think for [Senior State Department Official Five]. I understand that the U.S. isn\u2019t going to be making a government contribution, but will other governments be making contributions at the reconstruction conference. And then, secondly, what \u2013 I guess this would be for [Senior State Department Official One] \u2013 in terms of \u2013 beyond UNRWA, what\u2019s the status of the deliberations on the broader aid to the Palestinians? I see the 251 million figure on foreign assistance back up, and if Tillerson is meeting with both counterparts in Kuwait, will he be making an ask of those countries to give more to the Palestinians if the U.S. is considering pulling back?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE: </strong>So, in terms of the \u2013 again, I just emphasized, I mean, the first day of the reconstruction conference is NGO\u2019s and we are of course the largest contributor to Iraqi humanitarian assistance, and \u2013 through various NGO\u2019s and the UN and others. But we\u2019re focusing our efforts here and we\u2019ve worked very closely with the Iraqis on this, on the kind of longer-term financing and what we can do to help them there. So again, that\u2019s going to be or focus. Yes, I do think there is a World Bank kind of project list that I think some governments and participants will be quite interested in, and contributing in, as well this unprecedented number of private sector companies that will be coming.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE</strong>: On the assistance \u2013 so our, certainly our internal deliberations about Palestinian assistance issues are ongoing, both internally and ultimately with the Hill. I think the Secretary \u2013 I think it\u2019s safe to say, in the Secretary\u2019s conversations with his counterparts, there will be a focus on this question of burden sharing, both in terms of assistance for UNRWA, for things like humanitarian aid in Gaza, which is urgently needed, and that has been expressed and discussed very clearly at the most senior level, and I\u2019m sure that will come up as well. And then the broader question of various forms of assistance for the Palestinians in the West Bank. Finding ways that other partners can step up and contribute, that\u2019ll be part of that discussion.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question comes from Gardiner Harris with <em>New York Times</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you guys just talk about the general mood of this visit? Last year, of course, the President had a euphoric trip to the region, to Saudi Arabia (inaudible), but it \u2013 you\u2019ve \u2013 talking certainly about hard conversations in Turkey, but you\u2019re going to be having hard conversations at every one of these stops. In Jordan, the king, of course, is upset about the Jerusalem decision and is going to be struggling with the UNRWA decision, because many of the people who are educated and get health care through UNRWA live in his country, the same in Lebanon. In Kuwait it sounds like you\u2019re not getting the assistance help for Iraq that you hoped. So isn\u2019t it the case that the Secretary is going at a time of sort of deep difficulty for the United States, or at least a \u2013 there\u2019s a much different mood about this meeting than there was at this time or a little bit last year?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, this is [Senior State Department Official One] here. Just \u2013 I would only say you\u2019re right. This is \u2013 these are really tough issues and these are going to be tough conversations. The Secretary is going to do some very difficult, serious diplomacy. These are some of our closest partners, but they\u2019re also partners with whom we\u2019re facing some of the toughest issues that we have to face in the region, whether it\u2019s terrorism, whether it\u2019s the future of U.S. assistance, whether it\u2019s the final defeat of ISIS, whether it\u2019s maintaining partnership with an important NATO ally. All of these are, I think, emblematic of the need and the necessity for the Secretary to be out there doing face-to-face diplomacy with his counterparts.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOUR:</strong> Gardiner, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a particularly tough conversation with the Kuwaitis. There aren\u2019t a lot of bilateral irritants in the relationship. I mean, one area that we\u2019re working on with many of our partners globally is reducing DPRK presence in countries. Kuwait is moving out on that front. We\u2019re going to ask them to do \u2013 to sort of close that issue out, but they\u2019ve been very, very responsive to that endeavor. And once again, Kuwait is a platform here for some really important events and discussions, so I don\u2019t think \u2013 and particularly on the Kuwait stop \u2013 that there will be any really difficult conversations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would just add to [Senior State Department Official One]\u2019s point that the underlying point here of the visit to Turkey is that this is an important NATO ally, one of our most important allies in the world and certainly in the region; and while we\u2019re having tough times, this is the time to go out and talk with them through the brass tack issues that we have to get through.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> Just to echo number three on Kuwait \u2013 so on ISIS, compared to where we were a year ago, it\u2019s a much different conversation. A year ago we were facing very serious threats to our homelands, particularly out of Raqqa and the environs of Raqqa. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the last year, but one of the key themes, obviously, will be that this is not over. There\u2019s still fighting in eastern Syria, and we\u2019re not going to quit until that is done. But in terms of the coalition, it is about as united as I\u2019ve ever seen it. It continues to grow and has very broad political support across the board globally. So I think that\u2019ll be an important theme.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And on the Iraq conference, this isn\u2019t like a snapshot and this is the one three-day period in which everything that will be done for Iraq reconstruction will happen in this three days. It\u2019s actually quite the opposite. As we move out of the period of very intense counter-ISIS operations and focus on stabilization, we\u2019re now shifting to longer term. The Iraqis with the World Bank will roll out kind of their vision for the future of how to do this, and this will then be a longer-term process, so it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 it\u2019s the beginning of a foundation for longer-term reconstruction. And I think given the level of participation, which is really quite extraordinary, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019ll be a very good start.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. We have time for one final question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our last question comes from Francesco Fontemaggi with AFP. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you for taking my questions. These meetings are coming amid a deterioration of the situation in Syria \u2013 in many parts of Syria. So what the coalition as coalition can try to do? You\u2019ve been issuing several warnings in the last days and weeks, but what can the coalition do? And thirdly, are you just going to ask them for restraint, or do you think that the operation in Afrin, which has now been lasting for a while, has to come to an end? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I\u2019ll start on Afrin. Obviously, you start with asking for restraint and look for ways that you can help bring it to an end as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t want to prejudge any of these conversations that the Secretary may have, but obviously, the quicker we come to a resolution on that situation, the better it is for the broader effort.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> I would just \u2013 you asked about the coalition. So the coalition is focused on fighting ISIS, and our military coalition \u2013 to the extent our military is on the ground in Syria \u2013 the mission is to fight ISIS, as Secretary Mattis re-emphasized yesterday. Our mission in Syria is to defeat ISIS and ensure it is an enduring defeat of ISIS, which is where stabilization comes in. So that is the focus of the meetings of the counter-ISIS coalition, and obviously, the broader Syria issues will be discussed in bilats and other forums.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for calling in today and thank you to our speakers for sharing their time this morning, and the embargo is now lifted. Have a good day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">\n\t<span><span></span></span>\n\n\t<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"100%\"><span><span> </span></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><a name=\"_ftn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span>[1]</span></a> March</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Excellency Mr. Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State, United States of America, Excellency Ambassador Godec, colleagues from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, members of the Fourth Estate: I am delighted to welcome and host His Excellency Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State of the United States, to Nairobi today. The Secretary is in Kenya for three days as part of his official visit that began at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa and that is heading to a number of African countries, namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Chad, and Nigeria.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOn behalf of His Excellency the President, the government, and the people of Republic of Kenya, and indeed on my own behalf, I take this opportunity to express our utmost gratitude to Secretary Tillerson for his historic visit. Visiting Kenya as part of his first official tour of Africa is not only a great testament to, but a timely reaffirmation of, our deep historical and strategic relationship between Kenya and the United States of America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLate this afternoon, Secretary Tillerson had the opportunity to meet and hold bilateral talks with Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta, during which a range of issues were discussed and modalities of follow-up of agenda agreed upon. During their meeting, President Kenyatta expressed his satisfaction at the existing strong bilateral cooperation on a wide range of issues and areas. He reaffirmed his commitment to continue working closely with the administration of the United States on matters of mutual interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe discussion focused on priority areas of cooperation, including their shared conviction in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, other transnational crimes, as well as regional peace and security, and more importantly, our economic partnership.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the bilateral front, President Kenyatta shared his focus on the Big Four agenda, which aims at improving livelihoods, creating jobs, and growing the economy of Kenya by focusing on critical areas of our economy in the next five years. He urged the Government of the United States of America to support the implementation of the Big Four and observed with delight the steps taken by a number of American companies, including Bechtel International, to set their African headquarters in Nairobi and their readiness to commence investment in construction of a number of our infrastructure projects. The president also expressed his appreciation that all processes are now complete in readiness for the inaugural direct flight between Nairobi and New York and expressed his optimism in the \u2013 that this flight \u2013 this flight \u2013 direct flight between our countries will boost people-to-people contacts and trade between our countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our exchange of views with Secretary Tillerson, I have reaffirmed and the president as well has reaffirmed Kenya\u2019s commitment to the values of democratic governance, constitutionalism, the rule of law, and human rights. We underscored the importance of respecting established democratic institutions as the basis for entrenching democratic governance across the globe. We noted the exponential growth of trade between our countries and we hope that we can begin to negotiate towards concluding a framework that will succeed AGOA when it comes to an end in 2025.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the regional front, Kenya sits in a fragile region with numerous security threats. We commend the Government of the United States of America for their existing robust partnership and support to us in the area of security, military, and intelligence cooperation. In this area, the president urged and Secretary Tillerson reaffirmed the commitment of the two countries to continue working together in the fight against terrorism, in countering violent extremism, and other security threats. We especially welcome the continued support of the USA to AMISOM. We in Kenya, like other troop-contributing countries, believe in the need for sustained engagement in order to sustain the gains made and to create an enabling environment to turn Somalia around. On South Sudan, we noted the slow progress in the IGAD high-level revitalization process, and we share very deep concerns about this crisis that has impact on large numbers of people. But President Kenyatta reaffirmed Kenya\u2019s continued demonstrated commitment towards our efforts to restore South Sudan to normalcy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn reference to environmental and wildlife conservation, we appreciate the longtime support from the U.S., especially against illegal poaching and trade of wildlife trophies obtained from endangered species, and we continue to urge further U.S. support in this endeavor in order that we can sustain and preserve our common humanity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI wish at this point to thank Secretary Tillerson for this historic visit. We hope he\u2019ll come back again to enjoy the fauna and beauty of our country that we hold in trust for humanity, and we hope that this time he will also take some time to enjoy a little bit of that menu. It is now my honor and pleasure to invite the Secretary of State of the United States to make his remark. Secretary Tillerson, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, thank you so much, Secretary Juma, for the welcome, and congratulations on your recent confirmation to your new position. And I truly enjoyed coming to Kenya and to continuing the work of the United States in this enduring partnership between our two countries. I do want to congratulate President Kenyatta and opposition leader Odinga on their meeting this morning and their joint announcement. This is a very positive step, in our view, and while we know addressing Kenya\u2019s ethnic and political divisions will take some time and effort, today both of these men showed great leadership in coming together in the agreement that they signed today. The United States looks forward to supporting the process that was announced this morning to bring the country together and to address the various national divisions. Kenya is a leader in Africa and a longtime partner of the United States, and we are steadfast in our support for Kenya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTomorrow, on behalf of the American people, I will pay my respects to those who died 20 years ago in the U.S. embassy attacks here and in Dar es Salaam. Tragically, we still are confronted with the face of terrorism. During our meeting today, we discussed threats facing Kenya, Africa, and the global community. The United States appreciates our security partnership with Kenya and our shared fight against terrorism. We recognize the 4,000 Kenyan troops serving in Somalia as part of AMISOM to counter al-Shabaab and bring stability to that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKenya is a country of tremendous opportunity. With a fast-growing GDP at more than 5 percent, a vibrant culture of entrepreneurship, and a regional economic \u2013 and a regional economic leader, we are eager to find more ways to work with you to grow our economic cooperation. In 2016, total trade between our countries was just under $1 billion. I know we can do much more, and we look forward to growing our trading relations. We commend the government\u2019s Big Four economic growth initiative, and look forward to deepening the ties between American and Kenyan business communities to support this effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the secretary already commented on, we shared our concerns during our discussions with the president about the importance of democratic institutions and Kenya as a leading democracy in Africa. We believe that there are actions that need to be taken in Kenya and that they need to correct certain actions, like shutting down TV stations and threatening the independence of the courts. I know Kenya takes these matters seriously. A free and independent media is essential to safeguarding democracy and giving all Kenyans confidence in their government.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States looks forward to growing our comprehensive relationship with Kenya. Our commitment is not to one party, but to all of the Kenyan people. We stand ready to assist Kenyan \u2013 Kenya and the Kenyan people as they move forward on what we know will be a very bright future. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Your Excellencies will take a few questions. I want to ask (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Karibu Kenya, Secretary Tillerson. Given the timing of the commitment to unity by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga \u2013 (inaudible) preceded your arrival \u2013 did the U.S. have anything to do with that mediation? And as mentioned by Secretary Monica Juma, the U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to Kenya\u2019s security \u2013 sorry, to collaborating with Kenya in the area of security, as well as growing trade. But what about the other programs, such as PEPFAR, Power Africa, YALI, and AGOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think the U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period. And we were very, very encouraged and pleased to see the two leaders come together today. But I think we really want to give them the credit. This was a very important, I think, action on their part to show that they\u2019re ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans regardless of party and begin to really take this long journey that\u2019s necessary to restore the country, eliminate these divisions that are creating obstacles to Kenya\u2019s future. And so I really \u2013 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning that came together in a very important agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We have another question from AP. (Inaudible.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Madame Cabinet Secretary \u2013 (inaudible) microphone? Madame Cabinet Secretary, could you respond to the Secretary\u2019s remarks, and can Kenya truly call itself a democracy in light of the severe restrictions imposed on free media in the country, starting with the silencing of television outlets, the firing of editors, and pressure on news outlets to stifle criticism of the government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Secretary, can you talk a little bit about the fact that your administration has been running the government for more than a year now and we still see vacancies in key administration posts, including assistant and under secretaries, also including the North Korean envoy? What\u2019s taking so long to fill these posts and what\u2019s your response to allegations that some posts are being left unfilled intentionally? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JUMA</strong>: Let me respond to the question around the media, because I think this has been played up significantly. First of all, I think the definition of democracy goes way beyond the media, but also the provision of free press in this country is secured within our constitution. And the incident that is being referenced here is a one-off incident. It\u2019s an incident that affected three of more than tens of TV stations in this country. It is a matter that involved investigation of the police, and you will know, if you operate in this environment, that we have perhaps the largest media corps anywhere on this African continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the notion that there is a restriction of the media in Kenya is actually not backed by fact and reality. In this country, I think it is important for me to emphasize that we bestowed upon ourselves a progressive constitution because we believed that only that constitution, only those liberties, only those privileges guaranteed by the constitution would help us to realize our full potential as a country. And that involves a whole range of rights and protection of institutions beyond the media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have to say this, that since this process began, the start of that new constitution, which was three decades ago, up and until 2010, when we promulgated the 2010 constitution, and from 2010 to today, including in the event that Secretary of State was referencing this morning, are all indications of our fidelity to our aspiration to deepen our democratic credentials. And therefore, I want to put it to everyone here that the democratic project in this country is on the right trajectory, and it is not under any form of threat whatsoever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think this is a question you\u2019re probably going to be asking the day the end of the first term of this administration ends. We have a number of nominees in the system, as you well know. We have \u2013 we\u2019ve had a number that have been confirmed this year. There are several waiting on their hearings to be scheduled before the relevant committees. But as you well know, the process is a fairly rigorous one, from the time we select an individual, they agree to serve, to go through their clearance processes, to go through the clearance both from a standpoint of security but also the clearance with the White House process, and then make their way over to be nominated directly for consideration by the confirmation by the Senate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd along that way, not surprisingly, sometimes things come up and people decide they want to proceed any further, or things come up that disqualify individuals. That\u2019s why we have a clearance process. It\u2019s an important element of the whole process of naming and confirming people so that when they are confirmed and they\u2019re ready to serve, there\u2019s no question that they meet all the qualifications as well. And when that happens, we have to start the process over, and that\u2019s happened to us on a number of occasions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think with respect to the open positions \u2013 I\u2019ve said this many, many times; I\u2019m going to stick with what I\u2019ve said and stand by it \u2013 I think if you look at the results that we\u2019re getting in very important policy areas, and you mentioned North Korea, and the open positions we have there, I think as we\u2019ve seen in the last 24 hours, the policy that was put in place and has been executed by the State Department over the past year has succeeded. And we\u2019ve done that in spite of the fact that we have people serving in acting positions in some cases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as I\u2019ve said many times, I don\u2019t lose a wink of sleep over the fact that we may not have our nominees in the position because we have very capable, skilled, career diplomats ready to step up and serve in those positions. And they are serving superbly, and we are moving the policies forward, and nothing is being held up because the positions are open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWould I like to have them filled? Of course I would like to have them filled, because it\u2019s easier on everyone, including our career people, and some of the career people that are waiting for confirmation. It\u2019s a very different matter to be Senate-confirmed versus in an acting role, and we know that. But having said that, I am very, very proud of the State Department and the work that we\u2019re getting done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>One final question from Ferdinand Omondi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. It\u2019s Ferdinand from the BBC. The United Nations accuses Kenya and Uganda of aiding the conflict in South Sudan by supplying arms at a time when the U.S. is pushing South Sudan\u2019s neighbors to enforce an arms embargo. What is the U.S. position in this, and what actions, if any, are being taken?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON</strong>: Well, the U.S. believes that the arms embargo should be enforced, and that\u2019s \u2013 our position has been very clear on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JUMA:</strong> I also have to state here that Kenya is not involved in any supply of arms to any of the parties. For the longest period of time, Kenya has been involved in the search for peace in South Sudan, and it would be foolhardy that we would invest in the search for peace while at the same time arming parties to that conflict. We take the first unintended consequences, including large numbers of refugees that are already flowing into our territories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I have to make it abundantly clear that Kenya has no intention of exacerbating that conflict, that Kenya is engaged in terms of efforts to normalize South Sudan, and it is not in our policy or our intention to get involved in supplying arms to either South Sudan or any other country for that matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you, Your Excellencies. And that concludes \u2013 that\u2019s the end of this press briefing. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

You may be seated. Thank you so much for joining us, everyone, on this working visit of the U.S. Secretary of State to Jamaica. The Prime Minister will make some remarks, followed by Secretary Tillerson.\n\n\n<p>\n\tPrime Minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Members of the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It was my great pleasure to welcome Secretary of State Tillerson to Jamaica and to host him and his delegation on this brief but historic working visit to Jamaica. Secretary Tillerson and I have engaged in critical discussions on issues of mutual interest to Jamaica and the United States, as well as the region, with a focus on promoting a peaceful, prosperous, energy-secure, and democratic hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmong the specific matters discussed were strengthening security cooperation in order to more effectively combat transnational organized crime; boosting the U.S.-Jamaica economic partnership; exploring opportunities to broaden U.S.-CARICOM engagement; energy security; the economic vulnerability of middle-income countries, including climatic events; de-risking and correspondent banking issues; and of course, the situation in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur talks reflected Jamaica\u2019s long and productive relationship with the United States and signaled the importance of the strong and vibrant partnership that exists between our two countries. I highlighted the common values we share based on our geographic proximity, our strong historical and cultural ties, our robust trade, tourism and investment relations, our large Jamaican diaspora in the USA, and our strong record of people-to-people contacts at all levels.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI expressed gratitude on behalf of the government and people of Jamaica for the high levels of support provided by the United States to Jamaica over the years, especially in the areas which have assisted in meeting our national development goals. In particular, we have greatly valued America\u2019s efforts to disrupt transnational crime through continued support to effectively secure Jamaica\u2019s maritime space. We agreed to deepen our cooperation in this regard, acknowledging also that the sharing and exchange of intelligence is critical to safely \u2013 is critical to the safety and security of our two countries and the wider region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to our economic partnership, Secretary Tillerson and I both agreed that the transformation of Jamaica\u2019s energy sector is critical to the achievement of our development objectives, including resilience. I expressed the hope that the U.S. will continue to support our thrust towards energy independence in the region, including greater efficiency in energy use and greater in cooperation of renewable energy sources. I expressed the hope that the United States will strengthen its economic partnerships and participation in the region in the interests of our respective countries and peoples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, we used the opportunity to discuss diaspora matters and the invaluable contribution of Jamaicans resident in the United States, including those engaged in service sectors of critical importance to the United States economy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson reiterated the concern of the U.S. Government on the political and economic crisis in Venezuela and the impact on the most vulnerable. We both agreed that positive engagement between the government and the opposition in Venezuela is essential, and expressed regret that the attempts of the OAS to promote dialogue have not been met with success. At the conclusion of our meeting, we agreed that the Government of Venezuela must act in the best interest of its people and that it should ensure that the presidential elections are free, fair, and credible in the eyes of the Venezuelan people and the international community.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, I thank you for visiting Jamaica today, as we work towards a shared vision of peaceful, prosperous, energy-secure, and a democratic hemisphere. I thank you for the frank and candid dialogue and the spirit of cooperation which have made our talks constructive and fruitful. I look forward to continuing the vibrant partnership enjoyed between Jamaica and the United States in the years ahead. I thank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, first, let me begin by thanking the prime minister for a very warm welcome to Jamaica and for the hospitality shown to myself and my delegation. This is indeed my first visit to Jamaica, although I shared with him some of my family members have been here. I think they have more vacation days than I do. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut indeed, it really is a pleasure to be here and, as the prime minister indicated, have a very, very far-reaching, comprehensive discussion and exchange on important issues to both of our countries, but also to take note of the strong record of cooperation that exists between the United States and Jamaica. And as most of you know, this is the concluding stop on a trip that I\u2019ve taken throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, and this stop I think is important because Jamaica is our closest partner in this region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States understands the importance of \u2013 that our security and prosperity are very closely tied to that of our Caribbean neighbors, and we\u2019re glad to have the partner we have in Jamaica. And I noted that the prime minister is assuming the chairmanship of CARICOM, and so I think it made our discussions even that much more timely and useful. Because we did speak about the region more broadly, as well, beyond just Jamaica and the U.S. relations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe did talk about several aspects of the U.S.-Jamaica bilateral relationship, and our view is of the outsized role that Jamaica does play in the region as a leader to other countries here in the Caribbean Basin. Through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, the United States and the Caribbean have really taken great strides in unifying our approach to regional security, but we discussed ways in which we could take that further and do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the Jamaican Government\u2019s commitment to countering narcotics trafficking and transnational criminal organizations and the cooperation that we already enjoy, but we also see many, many opportunities to enhance that cooperation to be even more effective in disrupting these illegal organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the Government of Jamaica has made important progress combatting the lotto scams, cooperating closely with U.S. authorities to extradite suspected lotto scammers to the United States and establishing a bilateral lotto scam task force, and we welcome that. The U.S. Government will continue to support Jamaica\u2019s security forces and criminal justice system. It is in both of our countries\u2019 interests to work together to investigate crimes, share intelligence, conduct asset seizures where legally and appropriate to do so, and bolster existing anti-corruption and anti-gang programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to our focus on regional security, as the prime minister indicated, we had a very comprehensive discussion on ways to promote increased energy independence not just for Jamaica, but throughout the Caribbean. And we stand ready to assist with Jamaica and other partners in the Caribbean to explore and develop the resources they have, but also to share the abundance of resources that North America enjoys and the continent enjoys. Jamaica is developing new wind, solar, and gas \u2013 natural gas capabilities, all of which are going to serve the Jamaican people better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, as mentioned to the prime minister and Minister Johnson Smith, the United States appreciates Jamaica adding its voice to the major issues affecting our region, and the prime minister just spoke very eloquently about the concern we all share regarding the situation in Venezuela. Jamaica\u2019s votes in the OAS to achieve stability, prosperity, and support democracy in Venezuela have demonstrated exceptional support to the human rights issues that confront us in the Western Hemisphere. We will continue to ask our partners to support the people of Venezuela during this very trying time for them, and we will continue \u2013 the United States will \u2013 to put pressure on the Maduro regime to return its country to free, open, and democratic elections. The people of Venezuela deserve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today, we\u2019ll continue to work hand in hand to advance regional security cooperation, build economic partnerships. We have so much more to do together, and thank you again, Prime Minister, for the very warm welcome. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you so much, Secretary Tillerson, and Prime Minister. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll open the floor for some questions. Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson, we have members of the overseas traveling media as well as our local media entities here with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have \u2013 again, the rules, you raise your hand, I\u2019ll identify you, and then when you \u2013 the microphone is brought to you, could you please identify yourself, your media entity, and ask succinctly your question to the leaders? I see a hand over there, if we could get the microphone that side, please. Ms. Chisholm, in the back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, good afternoon. Andrea Chisholm from Television Jamaica. Secretary Tillerson, at the United Nations prior to the vote on Jerusalem, the U.S. ambassador to the UN said that we are watching, and many saw that as a threat to small and developing countries. Then there are some who classify Haiti, one of our CARICOM partners, as \u201cblank-hole\u201d countries. How should we perceive your visit today and how can Caribbean countries think that you respect us and it\u2019s not more of the United States just throwing their power around?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I\u2019m here to reinforce the partnership and how we view the partnerships with Jamaica, but also with the entire Caribbean region, as I just indicated in my remarks. This is an important region to us. As we discussed today, this is the United States\u2019 third border, and Jamaica has the largest stretch of that third border with the United States \u2013 very important to our national security but also important to future economic opportunity as well. So the U.S. sees many, many opportunities for furthering our cooperation on trade, for strengthening our security cooperation, and most particularly, for combating these transnational criminal organizations that bring nothing but problems and violence and devastation to Jamaica and the region, but also certainly to the homeland for the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we seek to strengthen this \u2013 our partnerships in the region, and we see many, many opportunities to do so, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re really excited about the prime minister assuming chairmanship of CARICOM and it\u2019s why \u2013 one of the reasons why I really wanted to meet with him today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Secretary Tillerson. I recognize CBS. I believe you had a hand up. Could you identify yourself formally, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, hi, Kylie Atwood with CBS News. Thank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister, I have a question for you first. The U.S. is continuing to look for ways to build up opposition and to economically isolate the Maduro regime in Venezuela. You\u2019ve stated that you support the U.S. in those efforts today, but is Jamaica willing and able to stop importing Venezuelan oil?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Secretary Tillerson, a question for you: How would the U.S. be able to support the Caribbean and Jamaica specifically if you\u2019re asking them to cut down on the amount of oil that they\u2019re importing from Jamaica? Could the U.S. provide any subsidized oil to Jamaica and these other countries? What are you thinking about as possibilities? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Jamaica supports human rights, Jamaica supports peace in this region, and Jamaica wants to see the people of Venezuela being able to enjoy their democracy. This is a principle that has nothing to do with any other country. This has always been Jamaica\u2019s position. We wish the best for the people of Venezuela. We now don\u2019t hardly import oil from Venezuela. With the new dynamics in the global trade and energy and with the United States now becoming a net exporter of energy resources, Jamaica can, in this new paradigm, benefit from that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Secretary?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as the prime minister, I think, made the point in his remarks, this is one of the things that binds Jamaica and the U.S. so closely, is strong commitment to democratic values. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re just both heartbroken to see what\u2019s happening in Venezuela, as we\u2019re seeing what was once a thriving democracy dismantled before our very eyes. It\u2019s the reason we intend to take all actions possible to persuade the regime to return to its full constitutional authorities, return it to the hands of the Venezuelan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs to any future steps that the U.S. might take regarding sanctioning oil or products to put more pressure on the Maduro regime, we are going to take into full consideration the impacts on regional countries as well. And we had a good exchange today regarding that issue not just for Jamaica, but also getting the prime minister\u2019s perspective on other countries, how they might be affected. And we will be looking at what are actions the U.S. might take to mitigate the negative impacts of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t want to get into specifics because we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to undertake a very quick study to see: Are there some things that the U.S. could easily do with our rich energy endowment, with the infrastructure that we already have available \u2013 what could we do to perhaps soften any impact of that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, I think there is \u2013 there\u2019s great unanimity in the region and certainly in the hemisphere that we all want to see some progress on this situation in Venezuela, which only gets worse day by day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Secretary Tillerson and Prime Minister. I recognize at the back Mr. Campbell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Edmond Campbell, Gleaner Company. Good afternoon, Secretary of State and Prime Minister Holness. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in December of last year rejecting the American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. But prior to that vote, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, she warned countries not \u2013 well, to vote with the U.S., or not to vote against the U.S., or the U.S. might be withdrawing aid from such countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, is that a policy position of the U.S.?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Prime Minister Holness, could you just explain to us specifically why it is that Jamaica sat on the fence in that particular vote? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think President Trump actually addressed this in his State of the Union speech the other night when he said we need to undertake a re-examination of how the United States provides aid around the world globally, and not just for this particular issue, but more broadly in terms of: As we provide significant assistance to countries, are these countries that align with our values? Are they countries that align with what we believe are ways to make the world a safer and more prosperous place?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think it\u2019s in that context that I would answer your question, as it\u2019s not been examined in quite some time, if ever, in terms of: How does the United States want to think about the generosity of the American people, because this is the American people\u2019s money that\u2019s being provided to others, and what should the expectation be around \u2013 what are we supporting?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so as the President stated in his State of the Union address, he\u2019s asked that we consider that question. There has been no new policy adopted at this point, but he\u2019s asked us to think about all of our elements of our aid programs, and are they really advancing and promoting the values that the American people want to see advanced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Edmond, Jamaica was one of several countries in the Caribbean region that abstained. From our perspective, from a diplomatic perspective, Jamaica did not need to take a position on another country\u2019s position on where they would want to see as a capital in the world. So from our perspective, this was not an issue that Jamaica should take a position on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd generally speaking, Jamaica conducts its foreign policy on principle. We are not conducting foreign policy for aid or for special benefits. So I want to make that position very clear to the Jamaican people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson. And given our time issue, let\u2019s take a final question. The gentleman with the beard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Oh, another question. I thought we were done. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello, Mr. Secretary, the gentleman with the beard. (Laughter.) I am Dave Clark from Agence France-Presse. The question\u2019s actually for Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. Prime Minister, when we were with the Secretary in Mexico last week, Foreign Minister Videgaray said that if America went ahead and expelled more than a million so-called Dreamers, that this would be a win for Mexico, a massive injection of human capital, and a loss for the United States, because they\u2019d be losing a lot of valuable workers. You yourself have just spoken about the large Jamaican diaspora in the United States. From your perspective, if the United States were to halt or reverse immigration from Jamaica and the Caribbean, would that be a loss for the United States or would that be a loss for Jamaica? And how do you feel when the President of the United States is reported as saying he would prefer immigrants from Norway? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Well, you raise a very interesting question. We, in Jamaica, have struggled with the reverse of immigration, which is the loss of tremendous talent and human resource, much of which we pay for. We call it the brain drain. At the same time, the Government of Jamaica would not want to see people deprived of their dreams and aspirations and ambitions. But from a government perspective, we are a practical government. And as we look on as to what another independent country would do with their internal foreign policy, we stand ready to welcome all our Jamaicans, and we want our diaspora to continue to support and participate in Jamaica.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou mentioned an important thing, Secretary Tillerson. You say, America the homeland. Jamaica is the homeland for Jamaicans, and we would want to have their skills and their resources here. And we support them as well in their dreams to settle and work in other countries, and we encourage them to abide by the laws and institutions of that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong></span><span><span> Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister and Secretary Tillerson.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

The United States stands in solidarity with governments and communities around the world working to end this human rights abuse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAccording to UNICEF, at least 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of FGM/C. If current trends continue, an additional fifteen million girls are at risk of being subjected to the practice by 2030. Although it is illegal in most countries, FGM/C is often performed in communities where the value and status of women and girls lags behind that of men and boys.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States partners with a broad range of stakeholders\u2014from policymakers and health practitioners to religious leaders and youth activists\u2014to work against FGM/C and to raise awareness of the harm it causes to societies. U.S. Department of State officials continue to engage diplomatically with host governments and through bilateral and multilateral partners to end this practice. In 2017, the Department contributed $5,000,000 to UN efforts combatting FGM/C, and its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices include country-by-country information on the prevalence of the practice and international efforts taken to combat it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBuilding on investments made in previous years to address the problem, we continue to advance initiatives to support survivor-centered programs in countries where FGM/C is most prevalent. The Department\u2019s programs promote the abandonment of FGM/C and work with communities and civil society organizations to increase their capacity to implement laws and legislation prohibiting it. This fiscal year, USAID is launching a three-year pilot activity in Kenya aimed at combatting FGM/C and child marriage by tackling the root causes and social motivators that drive these practices, including women\u2019s lack of agency, unresponsive health services, inactive protection networks, and limited economic opportunities for women and girls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe advancement of women and girls is essential to peace, prosperity, and security. We remain committed in our efforts to combat all forms of gender-based violence, including FGM/C. Today, we renew the call for zero tolerance to end this harmful procedure that affects women and girls in far too many places across the globe.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

May we rise, please? I thank you very much. <i>Ameseginalehu</i>. Your Excellency Dr. Workneh Gebeyehu, foreign minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; Your Excellency Rex Wayne Tillerson, U.S. Secretary of State; ambassadors, ministers, all protocol observed, welcome to Addis Ababa, the political and diplomatic hub of Africa.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs His Excellency Minister Tillerson said during his speech at George Mason University, Africa is part of the future. It\u2019s a continent in which 70 percent of its population is youth. This population, Your Excellency, is an opportunity and, again, a challenge. Ethiopia, as a UN-U.S. partner and longer in the continent, I believe this extraordinary visit will further deepen the ties of Ethiopia and the United States, one of the oldest diplomatic ties.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAccording to our program, His Excellency Dr. Workneh and His Excellency Rex Tillerson will highlight the gist of their discussions to the media, and that will be followed by questions from media houses. Media houses, make sure that you have one questions. If it is more than one, the two principals will ask \u2013 will respond to one question only.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI thank you very much. Excellency Dr. Workneh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER WORKNEH: </b>Thank you very much. Thank you. Good afternoon. The house is full. Your Excellency Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State of the United States of America, we are delighted to have you here in your visit to Africa as a first stop here in Addis Ababa. United States and Ethiopia have a century-old relationship, a relationship which, time-tested, always a relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Your Excellency, your coming here is a testament for this strong relationship. I and Excellency Secretary discussed extensive issues bilaterally. We discussed about our regional issues \u2013 the regional security, international issues, international politics \u2013 at the same time, how to boost our economic ties and investment between the United States of America and Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe touched about the issue of South Sudan and Somalia, which we are working very closely together. And also, we discussed other very important security concerns that we have in common. And also, I explained to Excellency about our situation, the country\u2019s situation, the transition that we are in the process, and we are very thankful that the United States of America is a close friend, which \u2013 working with us in all aspects, especially in economic areas. So it was very cordial, candid, and very fruitful discussion. And thank you so much, Your Excellency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, thank you as well, Excellency, for the warm welcome and hospitality. And we just had a very enjoyable lunch where we were able to continue our discussion with a number of members of both of our delegations, which is always useful to gain a greater understanding of each other. I also want to welcome both the local press and the foreign media as well to this event. And we do appreciate our partnership, and particularly at such a critical time for Ethiopia. I also look forward to my meeting later today with the prime minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m quite excited to be in Ethiopia. This is my first visit, and certainly this was an important place to start my trip as Secretary of State to the continent, in large measure because of the more than 100-year diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the United States. And it\u2019s been an enduring relationship; as the foreign minister described it, an all-weather relationship, that even when storm clouds gather we remain friends and have always worked through challenges together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also want to acknowledge again today this being International Women\u2019s Day and an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women across the world, and note the role of women in Ethiopia in promoting economic growth as well. It\u2019s quite evident the prominence that women already occupy in government, but in economics as well, strengthening the rule of law, the important role they play in human rights and building and strengthening a civil society that will thrive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I indicated, the United States and Ethiopia are longstanding partners. I was glad to have the opportunity to exchange views with the foreign minister on many areas of mutual interest that we share. We recognize and share concerns expressed by the government about incidents of violence and loss of life. We do firmly believe the answer is greater freedom for people, not less. We recognize the transition that is underway in Ethiopia, the first-ever voluntary transfer of power. And I view this as a very positive symbol of the strength of this very young democracy in Ethiopia, a peaceful transition of power.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGiven recent events, the United States has expressed our concerns with the government\u2019s decision to impose another state of emergency, because it does put restrictions on fundamental rights like assembly and expression. We also discussed in our exchange the importance of ensuring that security forces remain disciplined in maintaining law and order, preventing violence. They have a very difficult challenge on their hand. This is \u2013 this tests their own discipline as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe firmly believe that democratic reform, economic growth, and lasting stability are best addressed through an inclusive political process, rather than through the imposition of restrictions. And we encourage the Ethiopian people as well to maintain patience, maintain support for your government through this change, through this transition, but also in pursuing this journey of democracy, which takes time and effort. Democracy is not easy. It takes a lot of work. But staying with it, lasting change will come about, and to not resort to violence. Violence is simply never a solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI was able to raise these concerns because of this very, very strong relationship that exists between Ethiopia and the United States, and we share so many values as partners. We want Ethiopia as a country to succeed and prosper, and we\u2019re confident that they will succeed and prosper, providing many, many economic benefits not just for the Ethiopian people, but for the neighboring countries in Africa, and ultimately for U.S. business interest as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe welcome the proactive steps that have already been taken with the release of thousands of prisoners, including journalists and political leaders, and we encourage additional concrete measures to allow greater political freedom of expression. As the seat of the African Union, Ethiopia plays a critical and significant role in leadership in the region throughout the continent and the world, and we appreciate its efforts for \u2013 to further our mutual goals of peace and prosperity on the continent. This is especially true of our shared security interests. As the largest contributor \u2013 Ethiopia is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations \u2013 they play a vital role in AMISOM in Somalia, as well as peacekeeping efforts in Sudan and South Sudan. We have shared treasure together in trying to advance the cause of peace, and we have shared blood together in this advance for the cause of peace, and we acknowledge that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEthiopia\u2019s influence in supporting the security of Somalia and Djibouti are particularly important at this time to keep global commerce routes open. These routes through the Red Sea affect billions of people around the world in terms of their economic stability. And we discussed the United States is eager to help Ethiopia liberalize its economy. We think it\u2019s going to bring great opportunity and attract many business interests as they continue the process of reform and liberalization, strengthen its judicial and commercial institutions, and assist in humanitarian emergencies here and throughout the region, including the almost one million refugees that currently reside in Ethiopia. And we need to reside \u2013 recognize Ethiopia\u2019s generosity in hosting those refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is a long-term friend and partner of Ethiopia. We look forward to working with you as the people of Ethiopia seek greater peace, democracy and prosperity, all of which we know you will succeed at achieving. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you so much, excellencies. Now, back to the media. Tibebu Yared from EBC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you very much. I am Tibebu from EBC. My question goes to Your Excellency Mr. Tillerson. What is the purpose and, of course, the implication of your visit to Ethiopia at this particular time? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, as I indicated, this is a very, very longstanding relationship, more than 100 years. Ethiopia is a large-population country, they are an important security partner in areas that I\u2019ve already touched upon, and we also see Ethiopia\u2019s journey towards democracy \u2013 I think 27 years now, which is a long time, but it\u2019s a young democracy, and as I indicated, democracies are challenging. It\u2019s not easy to take a country forward as a democracy. And so we\u2019re here also to support Ethiopia\u2019s journey towards a democratic society and institutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut importantly, also, to have an exchange on additional steps that could be taken, what else can the U.S. do to be supportive and helpful of Ethiopia\u2019s economic development. Ethiopia has a vibrant economy, but there\u2019s a lot of potential that has yet to be realized in Ethiopia\u2019s economy, and we think there are great opportunities for U.S. private sector engagement in supporting economic growth, creating jobs for these many, many millions of young people who are working hard at getting an education in school; now they want to have their opportunity for a future themselves. And so we would like \u2013 we want to be a part of that and hope to be a part of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there are so many touch points where we share a common interest of security, stability for the region, which affects our security but also affects global security, and then opportunities for economic prosperity. And that\u2019s the purpose of the trip, is to \u2013 for us to better understand how do we work together as partners to achieve what are really common aspirations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Next question, Sisay Woubeshet, Afro FM. I am trying to meet gender parity. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. My question also goes to Secretary Tillerson. You came during the time of the second state of emergency here in Ethiopia, and what is your opinion towards the state of emergency, as many nations are opining on that? And how is the U.S. following the current political situation in Ethiopia and what role does it want to play? Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Well, as I indicated, first and foremost, I want to acknowledge this voluntary transfer of power. We think that\u2019s a very powerful symbol to the strength of the democratic process here in Ethiopia, and we think it\u2019s important that the parliament, which has been elected by the Ethiopian people, decide who the next leadership be. That\u2019s the way democracies should perform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I want to first acknowledge the very positive aspects of what is happening. I know it\u2019s challenging for the country. It creates uncertainty. And that is the hard part of democracy. But we support this peaceful transfer of power.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs to the state of emergency, as I indicated, we believe ultimately giving people greater freedom gives them a greater investment in this democracy as well. And so while we appreciate the government\u2019s responsibility to maintain control and not allow violence to break out and harm innocent people as well who may become victims of violence, it is important that that \u2013 that the country move on past the state of emergency as quickly as possible. We hope that that can occur. As I said, we\u2019re encouraged that a number of steps have been taken to release large numbers of people who have been detained. That\u2019s an important step. But the citizens of Ethiopia have a responsibility as well to behave in a nonviolent way, and we hope the government allows that nonviolent expression to take place. This is all part of understanding how to best serve the citizens of Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you very much. Girum Chala from CGTN, international correspondent based in Addis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. I\u2019m from CGTN. Mr. Minister, thank you very much, as well as Mr. Secretary. Ethiopian Airlines over the past few years has spent about $20 billion \u2013 that\u2019s Ethiopian money \u2013 invested in the United States, in Boeing Company, to be particularly straightforward. Now, when it comes to those \u2013 the money spent, 100,000-plus jobs were created in the United States. When it comes to the investments of the United States to Africa, Ethiopia particularly, we don\u2019t see much. Policy-wise, what\u2019s the next move in this country and particularly also in the African continent to expedite investment? And how do you view, Mr. Minister, the expectation from Ethiopia\u2019s side, the U.S. involvement in helping the country industrialize and even more trade internationally? Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Well, we had a very robust discussion of economic opportunities and the potential economic opportunities that we see within Ethiopia. And because you mentioned the aviation connection, Ethiopia is becoming a critical hub for intercontinental traffic for people traveling from the United States, with more and more nonstop connections for Americans to travel to Addis Ababa and then make connections to other parts of the continent. I think this is going to promote a great deal of interest in Africa and in Ethiopia. There are still economic reform measures that are necessary, not just in Ethiopia, but in other parts of Africa as well, to lower some of the barriers to investment, create greater certainty to outside business investors, strong rule of law, good regulatory processes. The more privatization of holdings as possible creates opportunities. But we understand this is all part of governments in transitions, economies in transitions, but that\u2019s what we encourage, is what are the areas of opportunity where we believe there will be strong interest in U.S. companies to participate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI commented on, in our discussions, the what we understand soon-to-be-completed continental free trade agreement, and we believe stimulating intra-continental economic activity and trade from countries on the continent is actually going to create even more opportunity for inbound foreign investment, and certainly U.S. business interest, in wanting to be a part of the intra-continental trading system as well. Similarly, with the civil aviation agreement that\u2019s being negotiated through the African Union. That once again is going to just tie the continent more closely together, more efficiently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these are very positive conditions for outside businesses to want to participate and be a part of. So I think a number of very positive steps are being taken, and I think it\u2019s really ensuring that American businessmen and investors understand what are the opportunities here. And we had discussions about how to do that as well. Recently creating an American Chamber of Commerce-Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce partnership is going to be very important to exposing American businesses to the opportunities here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think there\u2019s a lot of it in front of us yet to come, and as the conditions are created and some of these pieces come into place, I think American business and private sector interest is going to grow in Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER WORKNEH: </b>Yeah. As Secretary has said, the issue of investment and trade is also one of the agendas that we have discussed with Secretary Tillerson. Africa is a future continent, as Secretary said, and Africa is a population who have more than 70 percent of users and skilled labor. So coming to Africa is, by all measurements, will benefit the business, the investment of America. So we are expecting more investors to come to Ethiopia and Africa; we are expecting more business from here to United States of America and from America to Ethiopia. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest airline who have the largest passengers from here, from Africa to United States of America and vice versa. This trade relationship will continue, and we hope that this visit also assists a lot to this \u2013 boosting this investment in trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Last question. Kylie Atwood, CBS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you. Secretary Tillerson, I want to pivot to North Korea for a minute with you. South Korea now says that Kim Jong-un is willing to negotiate with the U.S. on abandoning his nuclear program. You\u2019ve said that you are listening to North Korea, and you said that the message from them will come very explicitly. Is this the message that you needed to hear? And are you worried that the South Koreans are overeager? Can the U.S. now commit to negotiations with North Korea? And I have to ask you one more question about Russia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Only one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I got cut off last time. Can I ask one more? Thank you. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is said to be here in Ethiopia at the same time as you, and the Russian embassy says he\u2019s actually staying at this same hotel. He says there have been talks of you and he meeting. Do you plan to meet with him while you\u2019re here? And if not, what does that say about U.S. diplomacy, that you refuse an opportunity to meet face to face to express U.S. frustrations over Russia\u2019s continued military campaign in Syria? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>I think there\u2019s five or six questions in there. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m sorry, but we had to do it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>First, with respect to North Korea, I think, as President Trump has indicated, potentially positive signals coming from North Korea by way of their intra-Korean dialogue with South Korea. We maintain very, very close communication with President Moon of the Republic of Korea. They are keeping us well informed of their meetings, the content of those meetings and the nature of those meetings, and we\u2019re providing them input as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of direct talks with the United States \u2013 and you asked negotiations, and we\u2019re a long ways from negotiations. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it. I think the first step \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this before \u2013 is to have talks, have some kind of talks about talks, because I don\u2019t know yet, until we are able to meet ourselves face to face with representatives of North Korea, whether the conditions are right to even begin thinking about negotiations. And that\u2019s kind of the current state of play.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to my meeting Foreign Minister Lavrov, I\u2019ve lost track of how many meetings he and I had last year. So any notion of us rejecting diplomatic engagement is really silly. That\u2019s just silly. We have had extensive negotiations, contact, dialogue. We have strategic dialogues. We have a number of mechanisms by which we talk to one another. I was unaware Foreign Minister Lavrov was going to be here at the same time I was until a couple of days ago, and I\u2019m unaware of any outreach to want to meet until I was on my way over here. My schedule\u2019s largely set, so if it doesn\u2019t work out here, he and I see each other often around the world, and we have each other\u2019s telephone numbers, and we do use them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you. I thank you, excellencies. Thank you, media houses. Your Excellency Tillerson said that this is his first visit, but I hope this will not be his last visit to Ethiopia. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for being with us today for a very, very special presentation. I\u2019m honored to welcome our Secretary of State to George Mason, who, as you know, is on his way to a very important trip to Africa. And I\u2019m slightly biased, but I think his choice of George Mason for this presentation couldn\u2019t be any better.\n\n\n<p>\n\tGeorge Mason is the home to students and faculty from over 130 countries, and we have made it as part of our mission to make sure that we are educating students to engage in a very interconnected world. We sometimes define ourselves as wanting to be a university for the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, who\u2019s now beginning his second year on the job, obviously, who was not a politician or a government person by training, and yet there are aspects of his career when you think about it make him absolutely perfect for this job assignment. You know that he ran ExxonMobil for a number of years, since 2006 until 2017. You know that Exxon is one of the largest publicly-held companies in the world and one of the most global companies. So yeah, it is pretty intimidating to run the State Department with over 44,000 employees, plus another 44,000 local employees all over the world, and a $50-plus billion budget. But that\u2019s actually smaller than what he used to run when he was at the helm of ExxonMobil. Plus he has spent a lot of time around the world running operations in the Middle East and in many other parts of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMost importantly, I think for this job, is that he was an Eagle Scout. And being a Boy Scout not only prepared him very well, but it marked him so much that he decided to serve the organization. And his \u2013 he served as president of the Boy Scouts of America for a number of years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo again, on behalf of the Mason community and without much more to say, just please join me in welcoming our Secretary of State, Mr. Rex Tillerson. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Thank you. Thank you so much, Dr. Cabrera, for the warm welcome. And it is a pleasure to be here at George Mason, and I\u2019m pleased always to meet a Fulbright alum, as well as a fellow engineer. And we appreciate George Mason University hosting the African and African American Studies program here and for the work it does on many, many important topics that we\u2019ll be discussing this morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLater today I will be leaving on my first official visit to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 not my first visit to Africa, as I made many, many trips and many visits during my past career, but it\u2019s a trip that really began its planning and originated back in November following a ministerial of 37 African nations and the African Union hosted at the State Department. Our conversation during that summit focused on counterterrorism, democracy and governance issues, and strengthening trade and investment ties with the continent \u2013 and these are all themes that I\u2019ll address in a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I said, in my previous life, I spent quite a bit of time in Africa. And my firm belief is that there is ample opportunity on the continent \u2013 for economic growth, for greater prosperity, and for responding to global challenges through mutually respectful partnerships. I do look forward to returning and building on a strong foundation of U.S.-Africa relations. And that includes visiting Chad, a country that has never before welcomed a visit by the Secretary of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past century, as African nations emerged from their colonial past, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in America\u2019s engagement with Africa. The State Department created the Africa Bureau in 1958 \u2013 a year following then-Vice President Richard Nixon\u2019s trip to the continent. Ghana had invited the Vice President and Martin Luther King, Jr. to attend their independence day celebration \u2013 an event that took place exactly 61 years ago today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few years later, President John F. Kennedy established USAID with an eye toward African development, and our first Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Ghana and Tanzania. Forty years ago this month, President Jimmy Carter visited Liberia and Nigeria, where he announced that \u201cour nation has now turned in an unprecedented way toward Africa.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday that turning continues. Our country\u2019s security and economic prosperity are linked with Africa\u2019s like never before. That will only intensify in the coming decades for the following reasons:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst: A major demographic shift. By the year 2030, Africa will represent about one quarter of the world\u2019s workforce. And by the year 2050, the population of the continent is expected to double to more than 2.5 billion people \u2013 with 70 percent of them under the age of 30.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second: Africa is experiencing significant economic growth. The World Bank estimates that six of the ten fastest growing economies in the world this year will be African.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor context, by the year 2050, Nigeria will have a population larger than the United States and an economy larger than Australia\u2019s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo understand where the world is going, one must understand that Africa is a significant part of the future. African countries will factor more and more into numerous global security and development challenges, as well as expansive opportunities for economic growth and influence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile Africa contains a wealth of diversity \u2013 among its peoples, its cultures, and its governments \u2013 there are common challenges and opportunities. Africa\u2019s vitality is reflected in its youth, but a growing population of young people means a requirement for more jobs. As more Africans move out of poverty, nations will require more infrastructure and development. The growing population of young people, if left without jobs and a hope for the future, will create new ways for terrorists to exploit the next generation, subverting stability and derailing democratic governments. Leaders will be challenged to innovate and to manage the limited financial resources they have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we look ahead, this administration seeks to deepen our partnership with Africa, with an aim of making African countries more resilient and more self-sufficient. That serves our partners, and it serves the United States as well by creating a stable future for all of our children and our grandchildren.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe future of stability is dependent on security \u2013 the condition that is necessary for economic prosperity and strong institutions. Without it, none of the other pieces can be put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the long reach of terrorism threatens to steal the future of countless individuals. This August, we will remember the hundreds of lives lost 20 years ago in the U.S. embassy attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam \u2013 where hundreds of lives ended.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSince that day, thousands more have died at the hands of terrorists in Africa. Terrorist attacks rose from less than 300 in 2009, to more than 1,500 in each of the years 2015, 2016, and \u201917. And more recently, we witnessed again the heartbreak of the abduction of more than 100 Nigerian schoolgirls \u2013 ripped from their families, forever changing their future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast week, in response to this growing threat, I designated and the United States sanctioned seven ISIS-affiliated groups, including ISIS-West Africa and ISIS-Somalia and their leaders in an effort to cut off the resources that these groups use to carry out attacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo prevail against such evil forces, the United States has committed to working with African partners to rid the continent and the world of terrorism by addressing the drivers of conflict that lead to radicalization and recruitment in the first place, and building the institutional law enforcement capacity of African nations. We want to help Africa states provide security for their citizens in a lawful manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday African nations are stepping up to take action, including the sacrifices that go with such commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTerrorism knows no borders. In the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram, ISIS-West Africa, al-Qaida in the Maghreb and other groups are adaptable, they\u2019re resilient, and capable of launching attacks throughout the area. Regional cooperation is crucial to disrupting those attacks and denying them the capability to plan and carry them out in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Multinational Joint Task Force \u2013 created by Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Benin, and Cameroon \u2013 along with the Group of Five Sahel nations, or the G5 \u2013 Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger \u2013 are pooling expertise and resources. Their work is instrumental in achieving African-led solutions to terrorism and instability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast October, I announced that the United States would contribute more to these regional efforts. We committed up to $60 million toward the G5\u2019s counterterrorism efforts \u2013 to enable them to train and equip members of the Joint Force and counter terrorist propaganda throughout these communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition, for more than a decade, the United States has supported the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership to provide training and promote cooperation between military, law enforcement, and civil actors across North and West Africa. We have deployed a similar approach in East Africa, with the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism, or PREACT. Since 2016, the United States has contributed more than $140 million to help partners prevent terrorist safe havens and the recruitment through these partnerships.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is grateful for the African Union\u2019s leadership in a growing, multilateral role. The AU Mission in Somalia \u2013 or AMISOM \u2013 includes troops from five African countries, stabilizing areas under attack from al-Shabaab and permitting much needed aid to reach the Somali people. I look forward to meeting with AU Commission Chairperson Faki on my upcoming trip to explore more ways in which we can work together to counter terrorism on the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States\u2019 role in these and other regional and multilateral efforts is to build capacity \u2013 not dependency \u2013 so our partners can provide for their own security. That\u2019s true of our approach to peacekeeping on the continent as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the largest contributor of peacekeeping capacity-building in Africa, the United States trains, deploys, and sustains forces that provide counterterrorism support, remove landmines, and facilitate peaceful transitions of power. This creates security, allows health \u2013 excuse me \u2013 allows health, food, and other services to reach areas of need.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast year, the United States supported more than 27,000 African peacekeepers from over 20 African countries. Here too more African countries have taken ownership of their future. A decade ago, Africans made up only about 20 percent of peacekeeping forces on the continent. Today that number exceeds 50 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we support important security efforts, we must work to find long-term diplomatic solutions to conflicts that cause so much human suffering. Until we do, the United States, as the world\u2019s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, will continue to stand with those most vulnerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a testament to that commitment, today I\u2019m announcing $533 million in additional humanitarian assistance to fight famine and food insecurity and address other needs resulting from conflicts in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Lake Chad Basin. The alarming levels of hunger in these areas are largely man-made, as conflicts erupt and people flee their homes. Under these conditions, people cannot produce crops and often lose access altogether to food, education, and health care. Many lose everything. And regrettably, Mother Nature can still be cruel, such as in the Horn of Africa, where a prolonged drought is contributing to grave food insecurity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese additional funds will provide emergency food, nutrition assistance, and other aid, including safe drinking water, thousands of tons of food, and deliver health programs to prevent the spread of deadly diseases like cholera to millions of people. This will save lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe American people, as we always have been, are there to partner with African countries to ensure their most vulnerable populations receive life-saving assistance. We also call upon others to join us in meeting the growing humanitarian needs in Africa. We hope these initial contributions will encourage others to contribute aid to increase burden sharing and meet the growing humanitarian needs in Africa. However, this assistance will not solve these ongoing conflicts, but only buy us time \u2013 time to pursue diplomatic solutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs many African countries assume greater responsibility to address their needs at home, the United States needs our partners in Africa to take an active role on the global stage as well. One area where we seek greater cooperation is our peaceful pressure campaign to bring the DPRK to the negotiating table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNorth Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, including its arms exports to Africa. It doesn\u2019t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia. It doesn\u2019t just include countries with longstanding ties to the DPRK, like China and Russia. This is and must be a global effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast month, during my trip to South America, I spoke candidly with my counterparts about ways they are actively working to contribute to this pressure campaign. Nations in Africa need to do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAngola and Senegal have taken steps to exert some diplomatic and economic pressure. The Ethiopian Government has made public commitments of support as well. But many African nations are holding back. We hope they will add their voices to that of the international community and end these diplomatic, economic, or weapons programs with the regime in North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecurity on the continent is a prerequisite for greater prosperity. And greater stability will, of course, attract greater United States trade and investment with African nations, leading to further development, building on what we have accomplished through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAGOA has been the cornerstone of U.S. trade policy in Africa for almost two decades now. And with AGOA, we\u2019ve seen a lot of progress. Total non-oil goods trade has more than doubled from $13 billion a year to almost $30 billion a year. In fact, last year, total U.S. trade climbed to $38.5 billion, up from $33 billion in 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re encouraged by the actions of many of our African partners who are seeking ways to expand trade with the United States. On his trip to the United States last week, President Akufo-Addo of Ghana addressed the National Governors Association, the first African president to do so. He talked about his desire \u2013 his people\u2019s desire \u2013 to transition from poverty to prosperity in a generation. The United States wants to help enable the public and private sectors in Africa and here at home to make that a reality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfrica still has vast, undeveloped natural resources. Private sector expertise in the United States can facilitate the responsible development of those resources, helping bring more Africans out of poverty to share in the economic values of those resources. But significant transcontinental infrastructure is necessary to support the development, spur economic growth, and boost intraregional trade on the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday only about 12 percent of total African exports are delivered to their neighboring countries on the continent. Compare that to 25 percent among ASEAN countries and more than 60 percent in Europe, and the potential for more economic prosperity through trade on the continent itself is quite evident. As African nations achieve greater regional integration through lowering tariff barriers and improving transport, energy, and infrastructure links, that will create more opportunities for U.S. businesses, investment, and transatlantic trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd importing American business practices and expertise provides the best combination for Africa\u2019s future by contributing to economic prosperity, equipping African nations with new capabilities, and doing so in an open, transparent framework. That is why we want to create the new development finance institution. DFIs are specialized government banks designed to support private sector development to improve development effectiveness. We\u2019re working with Congress to give the United States the ability to compete with countries that already utilize finance to achieve their goals in the developing world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPower Africa, a USAID-led program, is one of the largest public-private partnerships in the continent\u2019s development history. Established five years ago, Power Africa was created to provide African countries access to one of the most basic needs for development: electricity. Today tens of millions of Africans \u2013 across Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 have access to electricity in part because of commitments from more than 140 private sector partners. Our aim is to provide 30,000 megawatts of power by the year 2030 \u2013 or 60 million new connections \u2013 to reach 300 million Africans. Administrator Green announced Power Africa 2.0 just last week to expand even more power opportunities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is eager to reduce barriers to trade and investment with our African partners, helping African countries transition from dependency toward self-sufficiency, growing their middle class, and better integrating African economies with the rest of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo prepare for the future and realize the continent\u2019s potential requires an educated and a healthy workforce. This is true all over the world, but it takes on even more urgency, given Africa\u2019s expanding youth population.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Young Africans Leaders Initiative is one way the State Department and USAID are investing in the next generation of African leaders. YALI provides leadership and professional development training to up-and-coming African leaders on the importance of a free press, how to build more resilient institutions, and even how to start a business. Today, YALI has over 500,000 members and representatives from every Sub-Saharan country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThrough the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, better known as PEPFAR, the United States has transformed the global HIV/AIDS response. And nowhere is this more evident than in Africa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen PEPFAR began 15 years ago, an HIV diagnosis was a death sentence. In the hardest-hit parts of Africa, infant mortality had doubled, child mortality had tripled, and life expectancy had dropped by 20 years. One in three adults were living with HIV. Millions of orphans were left behind. And only 50,000 people were receiving HIV treatments. Today, the American people, through PEPFAR, have provided lifesaving treatments to over 13.3 million men, women, and children. It has allowed more than 2.2 million babies to be born HIV-free and continues to support more than 6.4 million orphans, vulnerable children, and their caregivers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis administration is committed to saving lives in Africa. Last September, I announced the PEPFAR Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control for 2017 to 2020. The strategy is a roadmap to achieve epidemic control in more than 50 countries within three years. It outlines a path to accelerate our work in 12 high-HIV-burden countries in Africa who are poised to achieve epidemic control by 2020. We can actually now see a future free of HIV/AIDS. It\u2019s just ahead of us, and that\u2019s critical to Africa\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor security, trade and investment, and economic development to sustain itself requires effective and accountable government institutions that earn the trust and support of their citizens. Peace and prosperity are only possible in a democratic society. Media freedom, open communications, religious freedom, and a vibrant civil society foster creativity, ideas, and the human energy for economic growth. Today, Africa has much to gain by creating stronger, more transparent, democratic institutions that reflect their citizens\u2019 voices, that reject corruption, and protect and promote human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe African Union estimates that Africa has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to corruption \u2013 hundreds of billions that was not invested in education, infrastructure, or security. Bribes and corruption keep people in poverty. They encourage inequality and they undercut the citizens\u2019 faith in their own government. Legitimate investment stays away, and insecurity and instability grows, creating conditions ripe for terrorism and conflict. We strongly support the African Union\u2019s summit\u2019s highlighting and encouraging efforts on \u201cWinning the Fight Against Corruption.\u201d We hope this year\u2019s theme is only the beginning of a more sustained, long-term focus on anti-corruption.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn support of this theme, the United States will continue its work with African countries to strengthen their democratic institutions. Last month, the State Department requested $137 million from Congress to support democracy, human rights, and government programs to create more transparent, less corrupt institutions that value consensus building over conflict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDemocracy requires transitions of power through free and fair elections. It also needs a vibrant civil society and independent media to help inform citizens and keep them connected to their government. Last year, the United States helped support free and peaceful elections in Liberia, a country that hadn\u2019t experienced a peaceful transition of power in decades. That included civic and voter education programs with a focus on youth, women, and other hard-to-reach, first-time voters, and working with media to promote responsible reporting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the Fiscal Transparency Initiative Fund<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> helps governments create more transparent, publicly available budgets, and equips civil society to advocate for areas of improvement. The United States is currently working on 31 projects \u2013 and is about to award nine more \u2013 throughout Africa. Already, the Financial Transparency Initiative Fund<a name=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> has helped Kenya, Chad, and Malawi develop measures to fight bribery and better serve their own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also keep good governance initiatives in mind when it comes to development. As Secretary of State, I am chairman of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, or MCC. Through this agency designed to reduce poverty, the United States is able to incentivize good governance \u2013 including greater transparency \u2013 by tying it to development assistance. And about 60 percent of MCC\u2019s funding goes to Africa. Last November, we signed a $524 million compact with Cote d\u2019Ivoire to improve its education and transportation sectors. This was only possible after the country had implemented policies to strengthen economic freedom, democratic principles, human rights, and to fight corruption. Spurring reforms before a dollar of U.S. taxpayer money is even spent is the MCC\u2019s model.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s an American model of development that has proven itself to work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States pursues, develops sustainable growth that bolsters institutions, strengthens rule of law, and builds the capacity of African countries to stand on their own two feet. We partner with African countries by incentivizing good governance to meet long term security and development goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis stands in stark contrast to China\u2019s approach, which encourages dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them their long-term, self-sustaining growth. Chinese investment does have the potential to address Africa\u2019s infrastructure gap, but its approach has led to mounting debt and few, if any, jobs in most countries. When coupled with the political and fiscal pressure, this endangers Africa\u2019s natural resources and its long-term economic political stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe welcome other countries\u2019 involvement in the development of Africa; in fact, it is needed. That\u2019s what the free market is all about, competition leading to more opportunities. But we want to see responsible development and transparent free market practices that foster greater political stability on the continent. We hope China will join us in this effort as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States sees a bright future in Africa. We have an opportunity to be part of Africa\u2019s journey to a stable, prosperous future for its people. Each of these priorities \u2013 trade and investment, good governments \u2013 governance, respect for human rights, combatting terrorism and instability \u2013 have the same guiding principle in mind: to help African countries build the capacity to take care of their own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are no quick fixes to these challenges, but the United States is committed to meeting them in partnership with nations of Africa so that the continent can increasingly become a place of prosperity and freedom in the 21st century. Thank you for your very kind attention. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I\u2019ve been collecting a few questions from the audience, some from the faculty, some from students, so I\u2019m going to maybe follow a little bit of a --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Go to the hard ones from the students.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: -- </strong>(inaudible). Since you insist, here\u2019s one. So the first one is maybe more of a personal nature, which is the reasons that led you to accept this position. As I mentioned earlier, you were leading one of the \u2013 really the largest companies that the world has ever seen, and not only that, you were CEO. You were your own boss. I mean, you had a board, but you were your own boss, and all of a sudden, why do this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I was within three months of mandatory retirement. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>That helps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>But I had \u2013 this was not in my retirement plans. I thought I was going to the ranch to spend more time with the life that I love and with my grandchildren. But the President-elect asked me to do this, and as I thought about it, this is \u2013 I\u2019ve told this story to a few other audiences, and it is how I got to the decision. When I was 18 years old, at that time we still had a mandatory military draft. It was the Vietnam War. And I registered for the draft, and they had a lottery system whereby people were selected. You got a number, and they pulled numbers until they met their draft quotas. And they got within three of my number my freshman year of college, and the year came and went, and my number was 89, they got to 86. And so I stayed in college, got a great education, got hired by a great company, had 41 and a half wonderful years, a dream career I never could have hoped for. My father is a veteran, World War II, fought in the war in the Pacific. My uncle is a retired major in the Army, did three tours of duty in Vietnam. And as I reflected on things at that point, I said I hadn\u2019t really done anything yet. It\u2019s my time to serve, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>Thank you for that. Now, you went to Texas at Austin, joined Exxon, and you may or may not have anticipated how incredibly global your own career would end up being. I\u2019m guessing if you had known what was going to \u2013 what your life was going to be like, you would have maybe prepped yourself a little better. Some of the folks in the audience still have the chance to make choices --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>(Laughter.) Right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>-- about what they do with their years in college, and this is a favor I\u2019m asking you, because I\u2019m pushing our students to go abroad, and some of them still don\u2019t believe why they should. So help me \u2013 what is the best plug that you can make for why should students go abroad? And then the follow up to that is: When they go abroad, they decide to go, for reasons still surprise me, to the UK, to Italy \u2013 well, Spain is not surprising, it\u2019s an awesome place to visit. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>So, why they should go to Africa, for example? So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think \u2013 in my first trip abroad I was a freshman in college, and I had an opportunity to travel to Peru. There had been a terrible earthquake, a big humanitarian disaster, two cities had been literally buried under thirty meters of a mountain that collapsed. And it led to a big flow of people out of the mountains into the edges of Lima and a terrible refugee camp was set up. So I went down to Peru on a five-day mission during the Christmas holiday to bring awareness to that situation, so that was my first opportunity. It had a tremendous impact on me because I hadn\u2019t \u2013 in fact, it was only the second time I had ever flown on an airplane. It was the first time I got a passport. And it was really the first time I had a connection to the world outside and realized how interconnected we are and how we\u2019re just all human beings trying to get through life, no matter where you are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think today the case for going abroad is even more compelling than at that time in my life, because all of you know the world has transformed so dramatically. The global \u2013 our economies have transformed so dramatically. Our own security has transformed so dramatically. And today, it is \u2013 it is all interconnected, and you simply cannot think about economic issues, you cannot think about security issues without thinking about them in a global context. And so, whether you\u2019re just continuing your journey and your education to expand your understanding of why you\u2019re spending the time hitting those books every night and writing those papers, it will completely change your perspective and understanding to go abroad and spend time in someone else\u2019s nation as the person that\u2019s not a citizen and see the life from their perspective, but also hear their perspective of how they look back at us. And it\u2019s \u2013 it will be probably the most valuable component of your education that you can put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then beyond that, this is going to continue, this interconnectedness of the world. The world is \u2013 really is \u2013 while physically it\u2019s the same size as it was the day God created it, for us, the people who occupy the planet, it is getting smaller and smaller and it is getting smaller at an exponential rate. And your generation is going to have to deal with that, and it brings with it an entire new dimension of challenges my generation is only seeing the front edge of. And it\u2019s important \u2013 the earlier you begin to understand that and how to interact with it, the better prepared you\u2019ll be for that in the future. And besides all of that, I promise you it\u2019ll be exciting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd go to the hard places. Don\u2019t go to the easy places. Like I said, I went to Lima, Peru. I went out into the mountains and the jungles. It was quite an experience to see how people exist around the world. Go to the hard places. It\u2019ll change you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> Thank you, by the way. Appreciate that. We\u2019ll take that and use it. (Laughter.) The \u2013 so now you\u2019re \u2013 in preparing for this trip to Africa, you\u2019ve picked five countries. How much of that is your own choice and based on your own experience in those countries? How much of that is sort of kind of technical decisions from your team? And at the end, why? Why those five countries out of all the many choices?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it\u2019s \u2013 obviously, I wished I had two or three weeks, because there are many African nations that are important to us that I think a visit would be beneficial to the relationship. But we picked these five. We\u2019re going to Ethiopia. Ethiopia is the home of the African Union; that\u2019s where it is located, their headquarters. Ethiopia also a very longstanding, important partner with the U.S. We have a relationship with Ethiopia that spans more than a century now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to stop in on Djibouti, the Horn of Africa. Djibouti is that country that sticks out right into the narrow straits between Yemen, leading into the Red Sea up to the Suez Canal, a very critical trading route for the world\u2019s economy and a critical partner in securing that trading route.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to Kenya, a large, thriving country. It\u2019s really where PEPFAR has seen its greatest success, and it\u2019s also been an incubator for how we expanded PEPFAR over the years. So we have a longstanding partnership with Kenya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to Chad \u2013 N\u2019Djamena, Chad \u2013 because Chad contributes the largest fighting force to the G5 Sahel and they have been crucial to our fight against terrorism in the Sahel and the success of what they\u2019re doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then finally to Nigeria, the most populous nation on the African continent. Tremendous natural resources and tremendous capabilities to succeed as a nation. They\u2019re still on their journey to succeed, and they are going to be critical to not just the relationship the U.S. has with Africa, but Nigeria is going to be critical to how Africa succeeds as a continent. And I spoke about the need to integrate African economies more, trade more with the neighbors. I think too often the U.S. in its approach \u2013 it\u2019s all been about trading across the transatlantic corridor. We really need to promote African intercontinental trade. That\u2019s actually going to open more opportunities for American investment and participation. So Nigeria, big country, very important country to the future of the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there \u2013 I\u2019d love \u2013 there are others I\u2019d love to go to. I\u2019ve traveled to North Africa, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be aware, but a lot of important countries in East Africa, South Africa, clearly, so obviously this won\u2019t be my last trip. I\u2019ll have to go back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> So you \u2013 as a CEO of ExxonMobil, of course you\u2019ve engaged, and I\u2019ve seen some of this. I\u2019ve been a partner in an earlier life in some of the work of how private companies can play significant role in development of the economies where you do business. Now, when I look at the proposed budget for \u201919, State Department is getting a pretty significant haircut, maybe a 25 percent cut, which I imagine is going to have to \u2013 it will force you to have to rely much more heavily on the private sector to achieve the diplomatic goals that you have. What are your thoughts about \u2013 are we going to see a bigger role in the private sector? And how do you bring them along?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Right. Well, first, on the budget itself \u2013 and that reduction\u2019s relative to 2017\u2019s budget because we\u2019re still waiting on an \u201918 final budget \u2013 but it also is a return to levels that are more historic for the State Department before the big run-up in the war against ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut yes, what we will be doing \u2013 and I mentioned that, touched on it in my remarks \u2013 is we want to facilitate more public-private partnerships. And we have mechanisms to do that and we have procedures and we\u2019re putting in place some new financing ideas where we can help countries have access to financing so they can participate themselves in private sector investments as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is \u2013 I mean, our role really, I think the U.S. Government\u2019s role, are the things that I stressed in there: one, to help with stability and security because if you don\u2019t have stability and security, it\u2019s tough to attract investment, it\u2019s tough to educate people, it\u2019s tough to feed people, to provide the bridging assistance in food security, on health areas, because again, as I touched on, the future is the young people. We got to have healthy young people, educated young people coming up. And then help with rules-based systems, so work with governments to put better laws in place, promote good courts and justice systems, and that\u2019s what will lead to the eradication of corruption which has drained the continent of so much capacity in the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\u2019s our role. The direct investments, we\u2019re there to facilitate and we\u2019re there to help companies understand what the opportunities are. If they need our help navigating through the local rules and whatnot, we\u2019re there to help guide them through that. But it\u2019s really to create the conditions in these countries where U.S. businesses and others \u2013 European businesses, Chinese, others to the extent they\u2019re ready to participate under a rules-based system, they\u2019re attracted because they see the conditions are there to be successful or at least have the opportunity to be successful. There\u2019s no guarantees in life, and I learned that in the private sector. All I ever wanted was to understand the rules, that the rules weren\u2019t going to change, and I had an opportunity to be successful. If we failed at it, we\u2019ll accept that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> One last question. I\u2019m reading some nonverbal messages \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 from your team. But the role of women in the future of Africa and my hope that you carry a very, very strong message \u2013 I know this is not new to you. I am aware of the investments that ExxonMobil made in women entrepreneurship. We know the impact that it has when women are kept in school instead of given into marriage. We know the impact that women have in improving health and the quality of life in communities. Let us \u2013 help us understand what our message is going to be in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it is something that I gained an appreciation for more than 20 years ago in the private sector, and largely because of investments and business activities that my previous life had in Africa, but also in emerging economies and emerging government systems, including Russia and \u2013 which I spent a lot of time in as well. And what I learned through studies, academic studies, but also my own experience is so much about creating these conditions that I\u2019ve talked about and so much about creating the conditions for people to thrive the way \u2013 and have a life like we enjoy is about breaking the cycle. And I was speaking earlier with the president of your student body about breaking the cycle and that we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re a generation away from breaking that cycle in Africa, but we have to stay at it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important element of that starts with women because it starts with mothers, and what we learned through our studies is that mothers \u2013 and probably this is true even here in this country, it was for me \u2013 mothers are the greatest influencers on how children are going to grow up \u2013 the values they hold, how they conduct themselves, and what they aspire to. And so first it\u2019s important that we support women\u2019s health first and their capacity to participate in the economic well-being of the country because too often we have women that are raising families without a lot of help from fathers. And so it starts with giving them capacity because they will raise better families.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut then secondly, putting women into not just the workforce, but the governance. They bring a very different perspective \u2013 and I see this in my private sector life, I saw it and I experienced it in the government sector as well \u2013 having a perspective brought that women bring, it\u2019s different from ours. I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that we\u2019re bad, but we have gaps and we have blind spots and women fill those in for us. But I think it\u2019s as much about anything \u2013 this is how we break the generational cycle is by really empowering women to fully participate in all aspects of our human life as mothers, as participants in the economy, as entrepreneurs, as participants in government. That is what will ultimately transform the next generation of leaders. Both men and women will be transformed by that and it\u2019s particularly important in Africa. And part of this is the history and culture of Africa. We know it works because we\u2019ve seen it work. We\u2019ve seen it work in very distinct areas. We just have to grow it out now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is crucial to, I think, the success of Africa creating a quality of life that we all want for people in the African continent. We want them to have the quality of life we have, and it\u2019s an important element of how we\u2019ll achieve that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> Mr. Secretary, we thank you again for coming to share that message with us, and most importantly for recognizing the huge importance that the African continent has for the rest of us, for carrying that message of economic development and opportunity, and for making Africa a priority. We wish you a productive and safe trip to Africa. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Thank you, and all the best to George Mason.

Today we will have senior State Department officials previewing the Secretary\u2019s upcoming travel to the continent of Africa. I want to remind you that today\u2019s call is on background, and I\u2019ll describe the attribution in just a few seconds.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Today\u2019s conference \u2013 our briefers today will be [Senior State Department Official One]; from here forward he will be referred to as Senior State Department Official One. We are also joined by [Senior State Department Official Two]. He will be referred to as Senior State Department Official Two. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019ll open up with brief remarks from Senior State Department Official One, and then we\u2019ll turn it over for your questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Okay. Thank you very much, and thank you on this very window day here in Washington, D.C. for joining all of us. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The trip by Secretary Tillerson really is an outgrowth of the ministerial meeting for 37 ministers from Africa back in November of 2017, and this will be a kind of follow-up with the Secretary traveling to Africa. So his trip is going to begin on Tuesday, March 6th, and it will take him to \u2013 first to Ethiopia and then down to Djibouti and then Kenya, and then all the way up to Chad, and then down over to Nigeria. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So this trip is really \u2013 and we apologize for kind of the last-minute \u2013 because we\u2019ve been just back and forth on how the trip would be arranged and the schedules and the trips going in and out and which countries to select. And so \u2013 and also given the Secretary\u2019s tight schedule, this is what we came up with, and we announced it yesterday.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the whole purpose of the trip is really to follow up on the ministerial meeting, and that is if Africa in the year 2100 is going to form 40 percent of the world\u2019s population, over 30 percent of the work force, yet also have the potential of having 50 percent unemployment rate, which is very high, that is a security issue, a economic issue problem, but more important, it\u2019s also an opportunity. And so the United States says, \u201cHow do we position ourselves to play a significant role in supporting Africa and also as a \u2013 to highlight this important relationship?\u201d And we said it\u2019s going to be based on \u2013 not only on economic and commercial development, but in the context of building strong institutions, governance, and security, as well as human rights.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issue, too, that we\u2019re looking at is how to really keep African resources and also development beneficial for the people of Africa. Right now we\u2019re looking at the growing indebtedness in Africa. That\u2019s not a good thing. We\u2019re looking at other countries, not helpful countries, other countries too, expropriating a lot of resources. And as you know, high rates of rare earth minerals and metal are from Africa. I mean, just one example is if your cell phone is 10 percent of that material comes from resources in Africa, in the next decade it\u2019s going to be 25 percent. Then that\u2019s an issue of: How do we do rational allocation of resources? How do we benefit the people of Africa? How do we create jobs? How do we really develop Africa, and not just become a repository for the development of other regions of the world?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are some of the issues and challenges that we\u2019re facing, and we can \u2013 through the Q&amp;As, we can go into what we seek to achieve in each country. But the bottom line is really economic development, how to build strong institutions, and also to move forward in the future for Africa. And just for your information, three of the four \u2013 three of the embassies being visited or countries visited has the largest American embassies in Africa. And just for your information, we have 44 American embassies and six consulates and offices in Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So we\u2019re set. We can turn it up to Q&amp;As.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone phone. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating you\u2019ve been placed into the queue. You can remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. And if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you do have a question, you may press * then 1 at this time. One moment, please, for our first question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And our first question from the line of Felicia Schwartz with <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Your line is open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the counterterror objectives of the trip. It seems like Djibouti, Chad, some of these stops are very counterterror focused, so if you could talk about some deliverables you expect or what you\u2019re hoping to achieve.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> So the issue comes in as there\u2019s really no deliverables, and the reason why is because for the Secretary of State and for our trip now it\u2019s really to underscore the commitment of the United States to Africa but also to explore with the leadership in each of the countries about what we want to achieve at the \u2013 together as partners but also in our overall program. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So going into Djibouti \u2013 so Djibouti is, as you know, mainly French relationships, but we also have \u2013 it\u2019s also the base for the only U.S. military base in the entire region. But it\u2019s more than just the U.S. military. I was there when Camp Lemonnier first started back in 2001. We\u2019re really talking to President Guelleh and his government because, as you know, Djibouti after the <i>USS Cole </i>bombing in Yemen \u2013 Djibouti now becomes really the main refueling spot for all U.S. Naval ships and also support for the U.S. as well as French military bases, the Japanese, our two task forces. We have 150 and 151 which does counterterrorism and counterpiracy.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But the focus is also how do we really continue to have a strong relationship with Djibouti. As you know, Djibouti is part \u2013 has troops in Somalia as part of AMISOM, which is to stabilize Somalia and to move it forward. And Djibouti has become a important country in peacekeeping operations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And let me just kind of give you one factoid. So if 53 percent of all UN operations are in Africa, 87 percent of the world\u2019s UN troops are in Africa, and almost 70 percent \u2013 actually over 50 percent \u2013 of all the troops are African, then that becomes very important. So for us, what we\u2019re looking at is how do we deal with Djibouti as a partner in that realm as far as peacekeeping operations. And the second area is to continue having good U.S. military relationships, because that is our base there. And it\u2019s not just a base for counterterrorism but also to support the security of all the other countries in the region. So I hope that kind of helps. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Chad, let me just give \u2013 on Chad is we\u2019re working with President Deby because, as you know, they were given on the visa sanctions list. That\u2019s not a good thing. They have been trying to get off those lists. They\u2019ve made tremendous motivations and movement toward getting off that list, so we\u2019re trying to support them as best we can and also to improve their own personal security.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We also want to give Chad importance because they\u2019re part of the G5 countries and their troops have made a tremendous amount of sacrifices in providing troops in supporting Mauritania and Niger and other countries in the G5 area. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So that\u2019s what we would \u2013 that\u2019s part of it. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Hi. And I just want to remind everyone to please make sure that your phone is on mute if you\u2019re not speaking. Thanks very much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have a question from Abigail Williams with NBC News. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi there. Thanks for doing the call. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> At the \u2013 towards the top in your opening you talked about the importance of focusing on development in these countries and job opportunities.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> What is it that the Secretary will be doing on this trip to try to help with that in the various countries he\u2019ll be visiting?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> I think we need to look at how to build \u2013 and so for instance, the countries that we\u2019re going to, so Kenya is our largest embassy in all of Africa. And then of course followed by South Africa, which we\u2019ll probably go later, and then of course Nigeria and then Ethiopia. And so \u2013 and Ethiopia, as you know, you\u2019re looking at transition from a prime minister to another prime minister, and so there we want to make sure that we\u2019re working with the Ethiopian partners on institution building, human rights, engagement, community leadership, et cetera, which will make them a much stronger partner. And also because of its 8 percent economic growth rate, it really is \u2013 becomes an engine for economic growth for the entire region. So that\u2019s \u2013 so we\u2019re trying to look at how we can work with that country.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And I\u2019ll give you one \u2013 sorry, I\u2019ll kind of go off tangent here. Ethiopia, had purchased something like $2 billion worth of Boeing 787s transport airplanes and also 777s. And so the prime minister, the late Prime Minister Meles, said, \u201cYou know, we just saved 35,000 American jobs. What are you doing to help Ethiopia?\u201d And that was a very valid, fair question. And so what we\u2019ve been doing is trying to look at the various sectors where they have economic advantages and opportunities, and that\u2019s in the ag sector. So in other words, their coffee, their flour, they even do Fruit of the Loom and Starbucks apron productions. But we\u2019re looking at much more. So in other words, in our discussions with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs and others, we\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat is it that we need to do to help these countries develop from agriculture to industrialization and then to consumer-based industrialized growth?\u201d And Ethiopia, I think, is on that track, but what are the mechanisms? What is it that we need to help them with as far as savings rate, education, and industrialization, and access to resources? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so as you know, the United States, we don\u2019t build things, but we teach things. And so our biggest thing is education, girls\u2019 education, women entrepreneurs, helping with expanding electrification. And certainly on a continent where most people do not have access to electricity and electricity is really critical for industrialization, that\u2019s important. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So going back to girls\u2019 education, in all our areas of development is \u2013 girls\u2019 education is very inexpensive, but it really brings out a lot of high-volume growth. Anywhere we have high girls\u2019 education, we also have high rates of growth. And when I was in Afghanistan, we were in the northern part. We had 40 percent girls\u2019 education there and economic development was great, but in the southern area it was less than 20 percent, economic growth was very bad. And we see the same results all over, from Ethiopia to Nigeria to the Congo. Areas we have 40 percent or higher rates of girls\u2019 education, we have tremendous amount of development, and it\u2019s sustainable development, and it goes to other areas. So that\u2019s some of the things that we\u2019re looking at in these areas. And the same thing with Kenya and Nigeria as well. I hope that helps somewhat.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Our next question from Laura Koran with CNN. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you so much for doing the call. I\u2019m wondering what message we can expect to hear from the Secretary in terms of how he views the role that China plays on the continent, and particularly, what the U.S. is willing to offer to some of these countries to counter that growing influence in the coming years.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </b> Yeah. Okay. So here\u2019s an interesting point is that we, the United States, especially part in \u2013 by region. So in the Africa region, we are going to have a heart-to-heart discussion with the Chinese. We\u2019ve invited the Chinese to come to Washington to talk about their programs in Africa. And so on the one hand, the unhelpful role is the providing low-interest but really concessionary loans which really indebts the country. So for all of us who worked on HIPC \u2013 in other words, getting African countries post-colonial period off of debt \u2013 to see these countries re-indebted again is not only outrageous and terrible, but for us it\u2019s really just \u2013 I mean, we spent so much time getting them off of debt, and to see them to go back on debt is just terrible. And it goes back to not only corruption in some of these states, but also the ease in which not only China \u2013 and you\u2019re talking Russia, Iran, and other countries providing low-interest loans. And this is really kind of another forum of impoverishment and poverty, because it\u2019s \u2013 unlike HIPC, we can\u2019t really kind of repay loans back to banks, and so this is going to be a very tough issue to address.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issues aside too, though, is China builds things. We don\u2019t construct. And so in that regard China can play a helpful role. The other issue, too, is that China has some really good ideas on development in developing areas, such as how to do better healthcare, how to do water production. So those are things that are good. Also China did a good favor for us in Sudan, providing an engineer battalion to provide assistance to the UN operations there. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So when you look at China, it\u2019s a very complex relationship. We have a lot of areas and issues that we\u2019re in conflict, but the issue comes in is that we\u2019re trying to find the areas where we can build some type of support and cooperation that will be to the betterment of Africa. But one area that\u2019s not to the betterment is these loan rates, which is terrible. So we\u2019ve looked at countries, and we\u2019re doing data dumping. Some \u2013 a lot of countries in Southern Africa and parts of the east and west are having anywhere from 50 percent to in one case 200 percent of GDP debt. And 80 percent and 50 percent are probably Chinese loans, and that\u2019s really not acceptable, and that\u2019s an area that we really need to address and focus on.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So when you said \u201ccountering China,\u201d I think the better word is probably how are we going to resolve tensions, problems. How can we make China much more supportive of the overall development of Africa. Because what we don\u2019t want to see is \u2013 let\u2019s say, for instance, Congo, which is very rich in resources \u2013 where you see Russia, China, North Korea, Iran taking out resources, yet the Congolese don\u2019t receive very much in benefits. How do you resolve that? How do you develop, how do you get these countries to really benefit from the resources that they have, yet at the same time these countries such as China, Russia, Iran is also developing but also they give back a lot to the Africans? And that\u2019s an issue and a question we need to pursue during this trip over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have a question from Nike Ching with Voice of America. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much for doing this phone call. It\u2019s really appreciated. My question is regarding the political development in Africa. Twenty countries in Africa are holding national elections in 2018, which include Chad and Djibouti\u2019s national assembly elections. And separately, we saw the state of emergency in Ethiopia, and in Kenya a demand for greater diversity in the presidential cabinet. Now, my question for you is given the history of unrest in Ethiopia and other place, in the U.S. vision, what is a genuine inclusive political process look like in those countries? And in your assessment, what should those governments do to improve press freedom and human rights? Thank you very much.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> And thank you, Nike, and then I look forward \u2013 we look forward to seeing you next week as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the issue right now is \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely correct. Over two decades ago, we were looking at the number of really democratically elected countries, and it was really very few. It\u2019s only three or four or so. But now we have over two dozen, which means those are two dozen countries which are not going to have transitions in government through coup d\u2019etats and illegal methods, et cetera, we hope. Now, obviously, a lot of those countries are fragile democracies and we\u2019re trying to strengthen them, but look at the most recent elections in Liberia \u2013 so the first really free, open, fair, and peaceful transition of governments in over 75 years, and that\u2019s a good thing. And really, after the horrendous rule of Charles Taylor and the degradation of the institutions there, but now we\u2019ll going back and they\u2019re building, and I think with the election of George Weah that\u2019s going to be a positive thing.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And you see the same thing in \u2013 with Akufo-Addo in Ghana and Ouattara in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Macky Sall in Senegal. So you see a lot of developments. And as we look at the 20 elections, obviously Nigeria, though it\u2019s not this year \u2013 it\u2019s going to be next year \u2013 that really is a major priority focus, because that\u2019s going to be the third most populous country in the world by 2050. And it has really very complex political issues and ethnic and tribal issues and security issues, and that\u2019s an area that we really are focusing on how to do a peaceful transition, a democratic transition, but more important is how to hold governments accountable to the people.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Now, you raised Ethiopia, and that is \u2013 remains a challenge for us and a focus for us as well and an opportunity, because we\u2019re looking at trying to build institutions, really strengthen institutions, and also have peaceful transitions and hold governments accountable to the people. We\u2019re looking at how we can have reconciliation and dialogues between all of the different groups \u2013 the Oromos, the Amharas, the Tigrays, and also in Kenya with the opposition and with the ruling government. And so those are some of the things that certainly during this trip are going to be the subjects of discussion, is how do we do these \u2013 building strong institutions, holding governments accountable? How do we advance political and economic reform that will help in the transition process? Those are issues too that we\u2019re working in Zimbabwe with the transition between Mugabe and Mnangagwa, and also we\u2019re looking hopefully at South Africa with the election of Ramaphosa from Zuma and seeing how that\u2019s going to transition. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And \u2013 so we\u2019re very hopeful. We\u2019re very high on Africa, and let me just give you one factoid that\u2019s very interesting: So we were doing some data crunching, and in the early days \u2013 in the \u201980s and \u201990s \u2013 we were looking at 19 evacuations of some country around the world. And evacuations are full evacuations or partial, and Africa had its fair \u2013 fair number. But if you look at the last couple years, actually, the number of evacuations or countries in crisis really are not in Africa. We had, like, four in the last year and a half. We\u2019ve had, I think, it\u2019s like eight or so in the last couple years, three years. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those numbers in Africa look really good. I mean, you still have the problems of DRC and Sudan, which really grab the press; but overall, across the continent, it\u2019s pretty good, it looks really good. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do is: How do we build on it? How do we boost stability? How do we do security? How do we build institutions? And so those are the things that this trip is going to try to highlight, and it\u2019s going to be really a start, a dialogue, that we can really work with our African partners to achieve. Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR: </b>We have a question from Simon Ateba with Today News Africa. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Yes, thank you. The president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, says there cannot be business without peace. And as you know, yesterday Boko Haram killed several UN humanitarian workers and also kidnapped hundreds of student last week. Will Secretary Tillerson, will he propose any new cooperation with Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon in the fight against Boko Haram, or will this be only about business? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And finally, why didn\u2019t the Secretary go to Cameroon since the U.S. has hundreds of troops in Cameroon fighting Boko Haram? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </b>Yeah, those are very \u2013 they were very good questions, and thank you. And just kind of starting out last, the Secretary\u2019s trip, this is his initial trip to Africa. He\u2019s going to come back again, and we are going to look at Cameroon, we\u2019re going to look at South Africa, we\u2019re going to look at other countries. Of course, with South Africa, with the transition to Ramaphosa, we were kind of saying, well, probably this is a very critical country for the U.S., but I think it\u2019s once the government is established and set, I think then we\u2019ll probably go there.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But Cameroon, yes. Cameroon raises an issue, but so does Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali. And so there\u2019s a lot of countries, and which countries do we head to? So on Nigeria, this is really a really important issue, and I know that in the last administrations, even the last three, we have always said going to Nigeria is critical to stability and the future for the U.S. relationship in West Africa. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So on Nigeria, you really raised really good points, is that \u2013 so we are following the recent kidnappings of 110 school girls, which really kind of follows up on several years ago of the Chibok girls. And those are horrendous, they\u2019re unacceptable, terrible, and how do you do security? But the issue that comes in, it\u2019s not only a security issue \u2013 and it is a terrible security challenge \u2013 but it\u2019s also political issues and really building those institutions and political dialogue between north and south, and also with the region. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those are some of the things that we need to look at. It\u2019s a comprehensive approach. The other issue, too, is on economic development and education. So looking at the UN, we have fresh UN reports about some of the extremist operations in the G5 countries, the Trans-Sahel, is for some of these groups it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s about getting jobs, it\u2019s about looking at getting an income for families. And if terrorism or trafficking of persons, if that\u2019s going to get them the jobs, then that\u2019s unacceptable and we really need to find alternative ways to help the economic development in these regions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those are some of the issues and challenges that we\u2019ll be working on is political institutions, political dialogue, reconciliation, supporting community-based development, helping growth, education. And then on the other hand, as you said, is the security, particularly in the north, and how do you enhance security. And it just can\u2019t be constantly a kinetic strike operation or bring in U.S. military. That\u2019s not the answer. The answer has to be developing institutions and also providing good police training, military training, and having governments accountable to the people and having people really have faith in their institutions, and also having opportunities for job creation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And what happens in Nigeria is going to affect the Lake Chad region, and that includes Cameroon as well as the G5 countries. So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at, much more broad-based, comprehensive, and really interrelated with security. Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR: </b>And we have a question from Michele Kelemen with NPR. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thanks. I wondered \u2013 just following up on Nike\u2019s question \u2013 how the Secretary plans to navigate the political turmoil in Ethiopia. Is he going to have any meetings with opposition figures or former political prisoners, and what messages he has to the government there? And then while we have you, you have any reaction to what happened in Burkina today?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah. So those are very good points, and in Ethiopia, again, it\u2019s \u2013 is to reaffirm that we\u2019re committed to the continued institutional development, and that we are looking \u2013 everyone\u2019s looking at how they conduct this transition from Haile Mariam, who belongs to really a minority group in southern Ethiopia. And there\u2019s a lot of rumors on who might be \u2013 it could be an Oromo or it could be another group. But whatever it is, is that the process really is going to bring all these various ethnic groups and regional groups and other political parties into the room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Again, the Secretary\u2019s trip is very short, and so that means there\u2019s going to be a follow-up. So obviously, after the Secretary\u2019s ministerial last year, we all went on \u2013 all over Africa to kind of follow up. I went on a 15-day, 10-country trip. I\u2019ll be going out after the Secretary\u2019s trip again to this region. And it\u2019s not just \u2013 Michele, not only just the interrelating with the Oromo and the Amhara groups, but again, community leaders, women-based groups, opposition. Yes, the people in prison, that remains a concern. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re addressing. But also regional issues \u2013 relationships with Eritrea, looking and supporting the Ethiopian negotiations with \u2013 in South Sudan, and also their troops in Somalia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So it\u2019s going to be an initial discussion. There\u2019s going to be follow-up and a lot of discussions. And even now, before the Secretary\u2019s gone out there, I\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve all spoken to the leadership. Our ambassador, Michael Raynor, and his team are doing a fabulous job really reaching out and just setting up the base for a discussion. And we\u2019re going to follow up, and this is going to be a long-term process. And it\u2019s not just Ethiopia. It\u2019s Kenya, it\u2019s South Africa, it\u2019s Zimbabwe, and it\u2019s Nigeria.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Going to your second question, is on Burkina Faso. We\u2019re still getting a lot of information that is \u2013 that\u2019s troubling. Burkina Faso is a focal country for our G5 operations. The $60 million that was committed by Secretary Tillerson, about 30 million is going to go to Burkina Faso for military training and security training, but also we\u2019re looking at all different communities. Burkina Faso is a very diverse community. It has a large Christian community \u2013 it actually has Catholics, has a number of Catholic bishops. It has a Muslim population. And it\u2019s looked on as being much more relatively calmer than the other states. But I think this attack on the French military, the local military bases, that raises concerns. We\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019re still getting assessments as this comes in, and it\u2019s still a very fluid situation. But it does raise concerns.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Any follow-up? Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. It\u2019ll be just a moment for our next question. One moment, please. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah. Oh, hello. Any more questions?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> I think there are a few. I think we have time for maybe one more.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Rosiland Jordan with Al Jazeera English. Your line is open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing the call. Three quick questions. One: Will there be any discussions with any of the governments about refugee outflows, particularly to EU countries and possibly on to the United States? Any possible ideas to try to deal with that problem? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Number two: Is there any reason, or was it ever considered, that the Secretary might try to visit Somalia in order to show visceral support for President Farmajo? There\u2019s a lot of talk about supporting the Somali security forces, but what about supporting the actual government in Mogadishu?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then finally, regarding Nigeria and Chad and the G5 Sahel situation, what specific conversations will there be about trying to deal with radical Islamic groups that have pledged their fealty to ISIL and who are wreaking political havoc, particularly in West Africa? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Okay, very good \u2013 great point. So going back to the refugee flows \u2013 and that is \u2013 that remains foremost in a lot of \u2013 in our minds, et cetera. As you know, the whole refugee flows \u2013 we\u2019re looking at approaching 10 million refugees in all of Africa. But I think we also should not forget the number of internally displaced, which is probably approaching around 12 million. And the two countries that are of highest concerns is South Sudan and the DRC, and those are two countries that will be under discussion, as the Secretary visits the African Union. And also with Ethiopia, which is leading the high-level discussions in \u2013 with South Sudan and Salva Kiir. So that does remain, but also the internally displaced.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issue too is, as you said, on Somalia. Somalia remains a very critical issue, but where the Secretary goes, I think what he announced obviously open to \u2013 subject to change, but right now, what he announced yesterday, those are the countries he\u2019s visiting for now. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But what you raise on Somalia is a point. So I\u2019ve worked in Somalia quite a number of times since the last \u2013 since Black Hawk Down. I was just there recently. We are looking and working very closely with the TCCs of the AMISOM troops and also the countries that are \u2013 the African troops and the African Union, also the UN envoys working on Somalia. But again, it\u2019s more than just security. It is a security issue, but it\u2019s also a political will issue about, as we have said to President Farmajo, is working with the six other regional leaders and also working on institution building and also working eventually to a one-person, one-vote, which we hope will be by 2024 or 2028. So that will be \u2013 continue to be a high point of interest for not only the Secretary, but for the U.S. Government.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then going back to Nigeria, so again, that is a challenge \u2013 the ISIS-West Africa, Boko Haram, and also the \u2013 where these groups are emanating from Nigeria to Lake Chad area and to the G5 countries. But the question comes in is \u2013 we continue to assess the changing and the evolving relationship. We look at the recent UNDP report which said that 71 percent of people who are radicalized in Africa were radicalized because of the abuse by the security sector in their own country. So that means that we need to do a lot more on security reform, training, institution building, democratic values, accountability to eliminate those \u2013 and the other area too is on job creation and economic, so building economic issues.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so when you say a lot of groups are claiming allegiance to al-Qaida or ISIS or whatever, we\u2019re seeing in some instances where these are aspirational, other areas of opportunities, but the other issue too is that it\u2019s economic in nature as well. So it\u2019s very complex as things that we\u2019re still looking at very carefully, and really how to address it. And those are issues that \u2013 it\u2019s not just Nigeria. It goes across the Trans-Sahel and it goes all the way down to Somalia. And then we look at how is it that \u2013 what do we need to do as the United States in our partnership with Africa and the African Union to really build stability so that they don\u2019t have these organizations and groups. And one of the things that we point to is the DRC in Eastern Congo, where you have a proliferation of these groups which have become extraordinarily violent, and a lot of it is due to the political instability, insecurity, and not knowing about the next electoral process in the DRC, which we\u2019re trying to push towards December of this year.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at, but again, it\u2019s complex, no easy answers, and I think we probably need to have a much more in-depth discussion. Over. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I\u2019m sorry we weren\u2019t able to take every single call, but we really appreciate you calling in. And you can follow up with the \u2013 you can contact the press office if you have follow-ups. And with that, we\u2019ll end today\u2019s teleconference. And thanks, [Senior State Department Officials].</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah, and thank you very much. Thank you very much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And joining us now, the new and very busy Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Good morning, Chris. It\u2019s great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let\u2019s start with breaking news. First of all, that savage attack last night in Paris, a Chechen knifing killing one person, wounding four others. What can you tell us about a possible link to terror?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, we don\u2019t know much more. We know that the caliphate ISIS has claimed responsibility. They said he was one of their soldiers. We can\u2019t verify that yet. The French authorities, with all the intelligence help the United States can provide, we\u2019ll do our best to unpack this in the coming hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s talk about some other breaking news. The North Koreans announced yesterday that they are going to blow up their nuclear site in 10 to 12 days. How big a development is this, and is that, do we believe, their only nuclear test site?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, it\u2019s good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world. And so this is one step along the way. I had a good set of meetings this past week aimed at heading in exactly this direction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to go back to the comment \u2013 and Kevin just played it \u2013 your comment on Friday that if Kim chooses the, quote, \u201cright path,\u201d the U.S. is prepared to work with North Korea to, quote, \u201cachieve prosperity.\u201d What does that mean in terms of direct U.S. investment in North Korea? And are we, as part of this, willing, in effect, to guarantee Kim\u2019s security, that regime change will be off the table?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, here\u2019s what this will look like. This will be Americans coming in \u2013 private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer \u2013 private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid \u2013 they need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. Those are the kind of things that, if we get what it is the President has demanded \u2013 the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea \u2013 that the American people will offer in spades.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And as part of that, are we, in effect, saying to Kim, \u201cIf you give us what we want, you can stay on in power?\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> We will have to provide security assurances to be sure. This has been a tradeoff that has been pending for 25 years. No president has ever put America in a position where the North Korean leadership thought that this was truly possible, that the Americans would actually do this, would lead to the place where America was no longer held at risk by the North Korean regime. That\u2019s the objectives. When I said earlier this week that I think Chairman Kim shares the objectives with the American people, I am convinced of that. Now the task is for President Trump and he to meet to validate the process by which this would go forward, to set out those markers so that we can negotiate this outcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any problem, given Kim\u2019s history and the history of his family as an oppressive regime, any problems with the idea of the U.S., even if we get our deal, in effect, giving a security guarantee to the Kim regime?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, we\u2019ll have to see how the negotiations proceed, but make no mistake about it: America\u2019s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or into the very place we\u2019re sitting here this morning, Chris. That\u2019s our objective, that\u2019s the end state the President has laid out, and that\u2019s the mission that he sent me on this past week to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about denuclearization, the objective. Two weeks ago, National Security Advisor John Bolton sat in this very seat, and he told me that the U.S. negotiating position going in is that Kim has to ship out, has to dismantle and take out of the country all of his nuclear weapons, all of his nuclear infrastructure, all of his long-range missiles before the U.S. will grant any concessions. On the other hand, this week, Kim met with Chinese President Xi and he called for, quote, \u201cphased and synchronous measures,\u201d in other words, action for action. Have you and Kim agreed what the sequencing is? Is it all of the actions by him first, or is it step by step? And is that something, as I say, that you\u2019ve agreed with, or is it something that Kim and the President will have to work out at the summit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, we\u2019ve had discussions on how this would proceed. There\u2019s still a great deal of detail to be worked on, and in the coming weeks we will continue to work on that so that we can be in a good spot on June 12th in Singapore for President Trump. But make no mistake about it: We\u2019ve done this before, right? We\u2019ve done trade for trade, moment for moment; you give me X, I give you Y; and it has failed repeatedly. I think Chairman Kim understands that. I think he appreciates the fact that this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before. If we\u2019re going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take truly historic measures to achieve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And how confident are you? Because you\u2019re going to be putting the President of the United States in a room with Kim in Singapore with the whole world watching. How confident are you that not only he understands it, but that he\u2019s going to have to \u2013 that he\u2019s going to deliver on our expectations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, to quote President Trump, we\u2019ll see, right? We are not to the place yet where we should be remotely close to declaring that we have achieved what it is we want. There\u2019s a great deal of work that remains. Our eyes are wide open with respect to the risks. But it is our fervent hope that Chairman Kim wants to make a strategic change, a strategic change in the direction for his country and his people; and if he\u2019s prepared to do that, President Trump is prepared to assure that this could be a successful transition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right, I want to talk about that. You\u2019ve said that we understand, and John Bolton talked about that nobody in the administration is starry-eyed. The President has been raising expectations for the summit, saying he thinks that they\u2019re going to make a great deal \u2013 his phrase. Your predecessor at the CIA, John Brennan, says he thinks that\u2019s playing into Kim\u2019s hands. Take a look:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP: \u201c</strong>I think that we\u2019re going to have a success. I think this will be a very big success.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>MR BRENNAN:</strong> \u201cI think he has been masterful in how he has manipulated perceptions and how he has manipulated and, quite frankly, duped Mr. Trump.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it a mistake for the President to predict a, quote, \u201cgreat success\u201d?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I think Former Director Brennan\u2019s remarks are silly on their face. We\u2019re going to enter into a set of discussions with two nations doing their best to achieve outcomes for their own people that are consistent with their objectives and goals. I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives, and our mission is to prepare the groundwork. And we\u2019re pretty far along the way in doing so, and we\u2019ll continue to work in the days ahead \u2013 30 left \u2013 to prepare for June 12th so the President can have a successful outcome, that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> After you brought the American hostages home and the whole world celebrated that, President Trump praised Kim for releasing them. And that praise \u2013 not the release of the hostages, but that praise \u2013 upset some critics. Take a look at this:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP:</strong> \u201cKim Jong-un did a great service to himself, to his country, by doing this.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>SENATOR SCHUMER:</strong> \u201cWe can\u2019t be fooled into giving the North Korean regime credit for returning Americans that never should have been detained in the first place.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> According to your State Department\u2019s latest report, North Korea still holds at least 80,000 political prisoners in its labor camps and other facilities. Is human rights an issue in this summit, or is this just going to be about the nuclear issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yeah, Chris, this administration is always concerned about human rights. It\u2019s the case not only are there political prisoners that remain in North Korea, there are Americans held around the world by other rogue regimes too. I can assure you this administration \u2013 I saw it in my role as director of the CIA and I\u2019ve seen it now in my first two and a half weeks as Secretary of State \u2013 is intently focused on achieving the return of each of those as well. We had a success this week. We\u2019re happy for those families and for America that those three Americans returned home, but we recognize there\u2019s much work to do. We still have Americans held and we\u2019re working diligently on behalf of each and every one of them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> When people found out that you were going to be on the program today they all had the same question. I must say I did. What is Kim like? With the possible exception of Dennis Rodman, you have spent more time with him than any other Westerner, at least two and a half hours the way I figure it. What is he like? Give us any kind of personal insight. How aware is he of what President Trump has been saying? Was there any mention of Little Rocket Man?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve got a lot fewer rebounds than Dennis Rodman, but I did get to spend a great deal of time with Chairman Kim. The conversations are professional. He knows \u2013 he knows his brief. He knows what the \u2013 what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHe does follow the Western press. He\u2019ll probably watch this show at some point. He\u2019s paying attention to things that the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team will be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u2019s just possible we might pull off a historic undertaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was there any mention of the exchange of insults back and forth?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No, we didn\u2019t cover that, Chris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> That\u2019s probably wise. (Laughter.) I want to turn to \u2013 there\u2019s a lot on your brief. Iran and Israel got into an armed conflict across the Syrian border this week after President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. Do you think that there\u2019s any connection that Iran feels less constrained now that the U.S. no longer is part of this deal about Iran nukes?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s ludicrous. That\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that Iran feels less constrained when during the JCPOA they have now fired missiles into an airport where Americans travel each day in Riyadh, they\u2019ve now fired missiles into Israel; to suggest that somehow the withdrawal from the JCPOA is driving the Iranian conduct that\u2019s taken place during the JCPOA in Yemen, the rise of Hizballah \u2013 all of those things took place during the JCPOA. Indeed, I would argue that they felt they could act with impunity. They watched. They watched Europe put exactly zero sanctions on their missile program during the JCPOA. I think Rouhani and Zarif need to explain why it\u2019s the case that while this agreement was in place Iran continued its march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> President Trump made it clear that he\u2019s not only going after Iran but he\u2019s also prepared to sanction European companies that continue to do business in Tehran. Here is the President: \u201cWe will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the leaders of France, of Germany, of Britain all say that they\u2019re going to stay in the deal and they\u2019re going to look for a way to protect European companies that continue to do business. The question is: How hard is the Trump administration prepared to go after European companies that ignore the U.S. pulling out?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Two things, Chris. First, the wealth that was created in Iran as a result of the JCPOA drove Iranian malign activity. It fueled Qasem Soleimani. It fueled the IRGC. It provided resources for their work in Syria and Iraq. President Trump\u2019s withdrawal is aimed at denying them that wealth, denying them the resources to continue their bad behavior, to take the money away from them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe withdrawal wasn\u2019t aimed at the Europeans. I worked hard over the short time I\u2019ve been the Secretary of State to try and fix the deal. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement with our E3 partners. I am hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works, that really protects the world from Iranian bad behavior, not just their nuclear program but their missiles and their malign behavior as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> And I\u2019ll be working closely with the Europeans to try and achieve that, Chris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what about if the European companies and the European countries say look, there\u2019s not going to be a renegotiation any more than there\u2019s going to be a renegotiation of the Paris Climate Accord? Is the U.S. prepared to go after companies in our allies like Britain, France, and Germany, if they try to continue to do business?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> The sanctions regime that is now in place is very clear about what the requirements are. My mission that I\u2019ve been given by President Trump is to work to strike a deal that achieves the outcomes that protect America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, and I\u2019ll be hard at it with the Europeans in the next several days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> A couple of final questions. Israel. The U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem tomorrow. The Palestinians are talking about a day of rage, violent mass protests, and the PLO won\u2019t even talk to the U.S. anymore as an interlocutor in terms of the Middle East. Is the peace process dead? And given the threat of violence, what are you as the Secretary of State saying to Americans in the Middle East in those parts of the world over the next few days?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the peace process is most decidedly not dead. We\u2019re hard at work on it. We hope we can achieve a successful outcome there as well. With respect to security, we are aware of the situation on the ground. The United States Government has taken a number of actions to ensure that not only our governmental interests but the American people in that region are secure as well, and we\u2019re comfortable we\u2019ve taken action that reduces that risk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Finally \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty remarkable given all that\u2019s happened, all that\u2019s on your brief \u2013 you have been Secretary of State for barely two weeks now. What\u2019s your vision for the State Department?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, first, Chris, I hope I haven\u2019t peaked in my first two weeks. (Laughter.) But it\u2019s pretty clear: We\u2019ve got to go put the diplomatic team on the playing field. It should be the United States State Department that is at the front of American foreign policy, delivering solutions to solve America\u2019s problems without resort to military force. And so I\u2019m going to build the team, we\u2019re going to get our swagger back, and the State Department will be out in front in every corner of the world leading America\u2019s diplomatic policy, achieving great outcomes on behalf of President Trump and America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secretary Pompeo, thank you. Thanks for your time in a very busy schedule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Always good to talk with you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you, Chris.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

We thank you for being here for the meeting of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of North America: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canada, Chrystia Freeland, the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico Luis Videgaray Caso.\n\n\n<p>\n\tWe would like to ask the ministers to get to the podium.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow we are going to listen to Mr. Chancellor Luis Videgaray Caso.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I\u2019m going to speak in Spanish, so I\u2019m going to wait for you to have the correct translation. Good afternoon for all the media. I am very glad to give \u2013 and welcome the Secretary of the United States Mr. Rex Tillerson and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland from Canada. It\u2019s not the first time they are here in Mexico. We are very glad to welcome them again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we are happy to have the opportunity to work in different topics that are important for our North American region. North America \u2013 we are convinced that it can be the most competitive region of the world in the next decades, and that\u2019s why we are working. We are working in a framework not only of neighborhood, but of friendship, of collaboration, and the sovereignty of the countries, knowing that together we can do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the conversations that we\u2019ve had today, of course, competitiveness is the core topic. How are we going to work together to generate more economic activities, more jobs for the inhabitants of this region? One of the topics of competitiveness where we can have an opportunity, an important opportunity, is the topic of energy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe North American region has the capabilities in human and the natural resources to be a very clean energy and cheap energy to be able to transform our societies and our economies. We have agreed to keep on working with the works of our secretaries, and we are also having the objective of getting to the regulations to generate the \u2013 and create the synergies where we can have a mutual construction of infrastructure, and of course, to enable the private sector, which is going to be able to create projects not only from hydrocarbons but also from the energy sector in clean energies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the commercial area, we see an important opportunity in the modernization of the Free Trade Agreement of North America, which is NAFTA. And this is going to be led by the corresponding areas of the government. We are making progress in a professional way, and from the Mexican Government we see a great opportunity to have a win-win-win situation \u2013 where Mexico wins, when Canada wins, and where the United States wins. We don\u2019t see it as a game where someone loses and someone wins. We want a modern agreement to be up to the situation of the 21st century. The North American Free Trade Agreement was agreed 25 years ago; it was a different world then. And now we have the opportunity to adapt it to the new reality, to have an agreement that is fair and that is reciprocal, to have trade based on rules, these rules that are going to allow this region to be \u2013 prosper and to keep generating jobs and welfare for the three parts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important part of the welfare of our region is the empowerment of women, entrepreneur women. And we agreed on working with them according to the mechanisms that are already established to have an agreement between the three countries. We had a meeting a few days ago of the empowerment of women in Mexico, and we are going to keep working on these important topics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother important topic of the region is the \u2013 that is, the interest of the three countries is the safety. We identified as an important tool in the matter of drugs, and we have celebrated three meetings. We are going to hold the fourth meeting this year in Canada, and we agreed on having a special emphasis on the combat that we are having against the epidemic of opioids and fentanyl and heroin. This is generating a great damage of our citizens. In Mexico, it\u2019s taking the lives of lots of youngsters, and also in the United States and Canada due to the use of these substances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we are going to continue working like last year with our United States Department to have a cooperation which is much more effective, knowing that we have a shared responsibility, and using the trilateral platform to exchange information and have the operational cooperation as well. We also talked about the efforts that we are doing jointly in the illegal human trafficking, which is a priority for the three parts, and we agreed on working on this topic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the meeting that we held trilaterally, we talked about important topics of our region, and I mean we are talking about three topics \u2013 the cooperation in Central America region. The initiative of Secretary Tillerson and John Kelly held a summit in Miami last year about the cooperation for Central America. Minister Freeland was there too, and we are working on knowing how are we going to work beyond the security issues, how are we going to contribute for the development, the economic development and the stability and the security of this place, especially from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. We agreed on working on what we are left to do, and we are going to take it as an important matter of our trilateral cooperation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also agreed on working with the cooperation initiatives in the Caribbean. This Caribbean region is strategic area which is going to face specific challenges. We are talking about the increase of the cooperation, our shared cooperation, to have a better resilience on the Caribbean islands against the natural phenomena which are derived from the climate change, and also strengthen the energy security in the Caribbean. We can do a lot of things. And each one of our governments have direct relationships with the Caribbean, but we need an effort between the United States, Canada, and Mexico in this matter, and it can be very effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd on third place, the situation of Venezuela. This is a very painful situation for our region and for our continent. We are facing the vision \u2013 one of the most important things that are at stake are the democratic system, and as part of this Inter-American Democratic Act, which is an instrument that is mandatory for the people of North America since 2001, while we cannot stay and do nothing with the situation of Venezuela. We have already confirmed our concern and our will to keep using the diplomatic tools that are at our hand to keep re-establishing the situation in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have shared with both ministers the role that Mexico played on the dialogue on the Venezuelan Government in Dominican Republic, and we decided to withdraw because there were no serious decisions made. But that does not mean that Mexico is going to keep having to stop having an active participation in Venezuela. The Venezuelan people are going to find the peaceful path, and Mexico is going to keep working with the rest of the countries of the region, of course, with the United States and Canada, to keep looking for a solution to this serious situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese are one of the topics that we mentioned with Mexico, Canada, and the United States. This is a rich cooperation. It\u2019s a very diverse cooperation. And I would like to say that Mr. Tillerson and Mrs. Freeland my gratefulness to be here. It\u2019s very important for me and for Mexico to be here. It\u2019s not just an opportunity; it\u2019s a shared commitment. Thank you very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Now we are going to listen to Mrs. Chrystia Freeland, the ministry of Canada.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. To start, I would like to thank Secretary Videgaray and the rest of our hosts here in Mexico.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Interpreter speaks in Spanish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Via interpreter, in progress) ...Mexico, the United States, and Canada is going to face a lot of challenges. The representatives of our countries are going to be having different meetings, and we should remember that we are working together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(In English) Mexico, the United States, and Canada have long been partners, allies, neighbors, and most importantly friends. We are brought together not only by the physical fact of our shared geography, but by the equally important fact of our shared values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe discussions we had today were very productive. Of course, we did touch on the NAFTA negotiations. From the very beginning, we in Canada have said that NAFTA must be updated and modernized to provide broader opportunity for the middle class and those working hard to join the middle class in all of our three countries. We are working hard for a deal that is innovative, forward-looking, and mutually beneficial for all three NAFTA partners. And here I will echo Secretary Videgaray and say we believe in a win-win-win outcome, and I am very hopeful that we can get there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of our discussion of North American competitiveness, we had an excellent conversation about energy collaboration, and I am hopeful that\u2019s something that we can carry forward from this meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also spoke about the importance of advancing democracy in the hemisphere, most notably in Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis continues to worsen. The Maduro regime is systematically violating the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people. We three agreed that we must do everything we can to restore democracy and relieve the unacceptable suffering of the people of Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also spoke about how we can cooperate to fight transnational crime, in particular the opioid crisis, which is causing such devastating harm to the people of Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, we spoke about our shared commitment to the empowerment of women and girls and discussed ways we can advance that agenda together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s always a pleasure for Canada to work with our continental partners and neighbors with whom we share so many values and interests on issues of mutual trilateral and also global concern. It\u2019s great to spend time with you, Rex, Secretary Tillerson, and thank you again, Luis, Secretary Videgaray, for hosting this great conversation. <em>Muchas gracias, amigos</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> And now we\u2019re going to thank Mr. Rex Tillerson for his message.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, first let me thank Foreign Secretary Videgaray for hosting today\u2019s trilateral, and thank Foreign Minister Freeland for making the trip down to Mexico City. In 2017, my very first bilateral visit as Secretary of State was to Mexico City, and about this time a year ago we were standing here holding a press conference. As it turns out, my very last trip of 2017 as Secretary of State was to Ottawa. So it\u2019s right that we should meet at this time in the trilateral relationship. And we meet \u2013 even when we\u2019re not meeting, I would share with you that the three of us are in very frequent contact on all issues that are of importance to our countries, on security, as well as economic prosperity, because our three countries are connected. When we can work together, and when we are unified in our positions and our voice, we have significant influence on the events not just in our hemisphere, but elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today we discussed a range of trilateral, regional, and global issues, and I cannot emphasize enough the importance of our economic relationships. Canada and Mexico rank as the first or second-largest export market for 42 U.S. states and support nearly 3 million U.S. jobs. North America is also a major player, as Secretary Videgaray highlighted, in the energy markets. And we discussed what we believe are really unique opportunities to promote market-based energy development and to further energy integration throughout North America and the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also talked and discussed following through on the 2016 trilateral MOU to economically empower women that Foreign Minister Freeland mentioned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBeyond our trade and economic relationships, we also discussed mutual areas of serious concern, in particular the most immediate threat to our hemisphere from transnational criminal organizations. We continue to employ a coordinated and multilateral approach to diminish the influence of these groups and rid our hemisphere of the violence and devastation they promote. In June of last year, Canada joined the United States and Mexico for a conference on prosperity and security in Central America. At that meeting, we secured commitments from international partners and in the private sector to address a range of issues facing the Northern Triangle governments, including economic, energy, security, and governance challenges. Today, we discussed on how we can follow up on those commitments from that conference. Success there will better protect all of our countries and provide opportunities for the citizens of Central America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGiven the deadly nature of the opioid crisis, we must do more to attack the business models of those who traffic drugs and guns. That was a major theme of the second strategic dialogue that I cohosted with Foreign Secretary Videgaray last December in Washington, D.C. Through our targeted dialogues like this and the North American Drug Dialogue, we are developing and deploying new strategies to disrupt and dismantle these deadly networks that smuggle drugs, that participate in human trafficking and other illicit activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTurning elsewhere in the hemisphere, we shared our concerns for the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in Venezuela. We all urge the Maduro regime to return to free, open, credible, democratic elections and to allow the Venezuelans a voice in their government. Our three countries will work with all members of the Lima Group to assist the Venezuelan people during this time of crisis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also expressed to Foreign Minister Freeland and Foreign Secretary Videgaray how I \u2013 how strongly I support Peru\u2019s ambitious anticorruption agenda for the Summit of the Americas later this spring. We hope leaders throughout the hemisphere will make concrete commitments to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and support economic growth and job creation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs challenges become more complex, North America and our three countries will continue to work together to find solutions. That makes meetings like we\u2019ve had today extremely valuable, and it was certainly useful to me and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with my counterparts. And thank you again for hosting, Luis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary Tillerson. Now we\u2019re going to have a question and answer session. We\u2019re going to have one question per each one of the participant countries. We\u2019re going to start with Mexico. Jorge Ramos from Grupo Imagen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. I\u2019m on your right, and my partners and I would like to know about the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and the Chancellor Videgaray and Mr. Tillerson, because they talked about the agreement for the Dreamers and the immigrants. Do you have the DACA agreement for the United States for the construction of the border wall? And have you talked about the agreement to fight against the criminal groups that are in both sides of the border, and also to stop the flow of weapons from the United States to Mexico? This is the first part.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second part is we would also like to know that \u2013 if in the agreement to try to go back to the normality in Venezuela, is there a military offensive from the United States to combat Maduro\u2019s situation, and is it going to be supported by Mexico and Canada?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd just a question for Mr. Tillerson: Is there evidence that there is going to be an interference in the Russian Government in Mexico as there was in the United States? I mean the elections of your country. And are you going to reiterate the situation that Canada and Mexico should not have a close relationship to Russia and China?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, I would like to know if there is an agreement between Mexico and the United States about the possibility of deploying guards in the transborder flights to answer to any issue that might arise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> (Via interpreter) We\u2019re going to establish a rule: If you\u2019re going to ask more than three, I\u2019m just going to answer three, all right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe didn\u2019t talk about the DACA agreement. We have talked about it before, but in the migration situation, it is a matter of the United States to agree on this, and it\u2019s the same thing in Mexico and Canada. And in the case of the DACA, of course we have shared information with members of the American Congress and \u2013 congressmen of the United States, but if the DACA people are coming back, it would be a win situation for Mexico and a lose situation for the United States. It would be one of the most important losses in humanity, because this is a situation of people who came as children and they have a clean record, most of them, and are engineers. They work in programming, they are doctors, lawyers, and of course, Mexico would be having an important win situation and lose situation for the United States. But finally, that is the decision from the United States and we are going to try to find a situation in the Congress for the future of these young people. But at the end, it\u2019s what they decide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ve talked to most of them, and most of them want to stay in the United States. Most of them want to stay there and some of them want to come back to Mexico, but it \u2013 this is not a matter of the bilateral situation. We also talked widely about this situation in this meeting, and Mr. Rex Tillerson was talking about it in \u2013 a few moments ago about the combat of the criminal groups is one of our priorities. And we want these efforts to have a more strategic planning so that we can dismantle the plans of these organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe mentioned it last year and we hope that we can have measurable results. One of the topics that we\u2019re going to mention in the dismantling of these criminal groups is going to be weapons. Of course, the illegal weapons that come from the United States to Mexico is something that should be dismantled. And we have an agreement of what the paradigm is. This paradigm should be cooperation. We should not take the guilt into someone else. The criminal groups that \u2013 and the illegal weapons from the United States, Mexico, and the cash that comes is to be able to dismantle the production and the creation of these groups. If we don\u2019t have a joint effort, we are giving a strategic opportunity to these criminal groups, and we\u2019re not going to be able to dismantle them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson is going to talk about the specific question about Venezuela, and I would like to say that Mexico is not going to support the decision that involves violence, either internal or external, for the case of Venezuela. And about the question of the special agents in the United \u2013 for the United States in trans-border flights, well, it is a proposal that has not been done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there are lots of proposals in terms of security. We are analyzing all these proposals and the operative proposals, but there is not an agreement yet. There is a conversation that is going to be taken seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Okay. So there were several questions in there. We\u2019ll see if I can remember them all. First, with respect to DACA, President Trump has put forward a proposal to the Congress that I think addresses in a very, very important way how people should be treated and the value of those people. And his proposal would remove the uncertainty for more than a million people that find themselves in this situation. And the President\u2019s been quite clear that he wants to see this solved, and he\u2019s called upon the Congress to solve it. So I think it is certainly his commitment to see this issue resolved once and for all, and provide clarity, which is so important, so that people know how to plan their lives going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the commitment to disrupt the transcriminal organizations, as I mentioned in my remarks, we created early last year \u2013 in fact, it was in this first trip that I made to Mexico City, the first bilat \u2013 a different approach as to how we cooperate to attack the entire supply chain of this devastating impact of drugs \u2013 cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, opioids. This is having a horrible effect on American citizens, Mexican citizens, Canadian citizens. And so throughout the year we have had two major follow-up meetings in Washington, D.C. We had a very important working dinner last night with the Mexican military counterparts and the navy and the Mexican army and Mexican intelligence service to discuss how we feel about the progress and what are the areas that need more attention. So this is a joint effort that is very, very active, it is very robust, and we intend to maintain this effort well in until we have resolved this problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou asked about Russian interference in Mexican elections. All I could say to you is we know that Russia has fingerprints in a number of elections around the world. We hear this from our European counterparts as well. My advice would be \u2013 to Mexico would be: Pay attention. Pay attention to what\u2019s happening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of air marshals on flights, we have air marshals on a number of flights in the United States. It\u2019s about creating security for both the arrivals and the destinations. And any action that would be taken regarding flights with Mexico will be done in full cooperation and coordination with Mexican authorities as well, all with a view that we want to provide greater security for all of our passengers that are traveling back and forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to Venezuela and what we would like to see happen there is a peaceful transition, if \u2013 if President Maduro would return to the Venezuelan constitution, restore the duly elected assembly, dismantle the illegitimate constituent assembly, and return to free, fair elections, then he\u2019s happy to stay and run in a free and fair election. If he wants to step aside and let someone else follow through on that, that\u2019s fine, but our view is you must return to the constitution, and that\u2019s what we hope Venezuela ultimately will do. That\u2019s what we all are working hard to see them do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t know if I hit all your questions. Those are the ones I could remember.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> Good enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Now our next question, Pilar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. My question is to Minister Freeland. According to the free trade agreement, the negotiation with the United States had several agreements on the United States. Would you give us an opinion about this? What is going to happen with Mexico and the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we also like to know about the renegotiation period. What are the risks that we are going to have in Mexico in the change of governments for Canada and for the United States? And we also like to know about their recent topics of the situation and told with the Minister Luis Videgaray.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> As far as NAFTA goes, as actually all three of us said, all three countries are strong believers in North American competitiveness, and we really believe that this agreement, which has now been in place for almost a quarter century, has made our continent more competitive. It has created jobs and growth in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The world has changed a lot, though, since we first negotiated NAFTA, and to give you an example, on the tracing list for cars in NAFTA today, we have cassette decks \u2013 which my children don\u2019t even know what a cassette deck is \u2013 but we don\u2019t have rear view cameras.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is time to update this agreement, to modernize it, to make it fit for the 21st century, to make it more effective for all three countries, and that is what Canada is 100 percent committed to doing. We believe that that is absolutely possible, and we are working hard with a lot of goodwill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of timelines, we would love to get this deal done as quickly as possible. Uncertainty is never good for business confidence. Having said that, it\u2019s a really complicated agreement, and we believe in taking the time it takes to get it right. So I think all of us are going to be working really, really hard to get it done as quickly as possible to get a good outcome for all three of our countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Tracy Wilkinson from the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> For Secretary Tillerson, you spoke yesterday in Austin quite eloquently, really, about the shared values of the United States with Latin America, the need to strengthen those partnerships, to build the rule of law and democratic institutions, and you also spoke, really, of the benefits of immigration. Our \u2013 all the passports of different colors that we have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDoes it undercut your message here and your efforts or mission to build on those relationships when a very different message comes from your own President, who, for example, in his State of the Union, described \u2013 painted a picture of immigration from Mexico as a cause of crime, or even today was attacking this morning the FBI and some of the very pillars of rule of law and democracy? Does that make your mission more difficult? Which \u2013 and which version should Americans believe, which version should Mexicans believe?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, for the Ministers Videgaray and Freeland, how difficult is it for you to negotiate with a government that speaks in such different voices? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think with respect to U.S. immigration policy, what the President, I think, has observed is that over the years, our immigration system has grown so many arms and legs, if you just look at the number of different programs by which people come to the United States, that oftentimes we don\u2019t have real good discipline around how those programs are enforced consistent with the laws. And in fact, as the President requested early in his term that a full review be undertaken of all the immigration policies, what we found is there were a lot of exceptions to the intent of Congress \u2013 had been put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the first thing the President has done is said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to enforce the laws.\u201d The Congress passed the laws, the executive is required to enforce the laws, and we intend to enforce them to the letter of the law. And so that\u2019s really where this whole process begins. So what we want is legal immigration, legal immigration where we understand who is entering the country, and why are they entering the country and are they coming to enjoy a nice vacation; are they coming to work here for some time; are they coming here for education or are they coming here to work; are they coming here to one day hoping to become citizens?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we really \u2013 what the President has asked is: Let\u2019s put in place systems. And that\u2019s where a lot of the new, in particular, immigration from countries that are very unstable today, that don\u2019t have strong governments themselves in parts of the world. Let\u2019s make sure we have systems in place where we understand who is coming to the United States of America, and as he indicated, we are a nation built by immigrants. All of us can trace our ancestry, or most of us can, back to someone in the family that immigrated to the United States. And we still value immigrants, and they bring enormous value to our continent. And that\u2019s what the President, though, is asking is, I want to know how this person who wants to come and live in our country is going to bring value to our country. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 fundamentally, that\u2019s what he is pursuing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd it is very complicated, because we have over the years put so many different mechanisms in place, I think well-intended, to deal with situations around the world, many of which \u2013 those situations no longer exist. And we\u2019ve never gone back and kind of cleaned this up, and gotten back to where \u2013 what was the original intent. So I know it\u2019s painful, the process is, for a lot of people, and that\u2019s why, as we move forward in implementing the President\u2019s directives, we\u2019re trying to do that in a way that accommodates the fact that this is hard for some people. How can we give them time to adjust? What can we do to fix a lot of this back in Congress?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that\u2019s why the President has been pressing Congress for a number of actions to make changes to the immigration law, to fix these defects that have risen over the years and crept into the immigration system. He wants this to be a country that\u2019s \u2013 that follows the law, and he wants us to enforce the law, and when it\u2019s not working, we should go to the Congress and say, \u201cLook, we need you to fix this part of the immigration law, whether it\u2019s on a particular program to deal with refugees or whether it\u2019s other issues like DACA, let\u2019s fix it.\u201d And instead, we\u2019ve had a long period of time where people have kind of issued a directive here and an order there, and things have kind of gotten out of \u2013 have gotten out of the normal order.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo my message \u2013 that would be my message to people trying to understand what the President\u2019s doing with immigration is let\u2019s have it very clear what the rules are. Let\u2019s enforce those rules, and then people that desire to come to the United States know exactly what the pathway is to get here, and they will have certainty when they arrive. Because we have so many people living in the country today that immigrated, and they\u2019re living under a huge cloud of uncertainty. And the President would like to remove that uncertainty for a lot of people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> Since the question was in English, I\u2019ll answer in English. Mexico will always be prepared to deal with, to work with any administration in the U.S. or in any other country around the world. And we do so because we are a sovereign nation, and we have clarity about our principles, about our objectives and the things we are willing to do and the things we are not willing to do. With the Trump administration, we\u2019ve committed to have a very close communication, and that has proven to be a tremendous benefit for the relationship. I think that in many ways, the relationship today is more fluid, it\u2019s closer than it was with previous administrations, which might be surprising to some people, but that\u2019s a fact of life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I want to highlight the role that \u2013 and leadership of Secretary Tillerson, who has been instrumental to achieving this, and to bring our countries closer. Yes, we do have some differences, as every other country does, but we\u2019ve been working very closely, we\u2019ve achieved substantial things, and we\u2019re looking into the future. This is a relationship about opportunities and about the things that we can do together, and we\u2019re working well, we\u2019re working close, and we are about results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> Yeah, and so \u2013 I think the Canadian view is very similar. Canada has been negotiating with the United States for as long as we have been a country. We feel we know you guys pretty well. In fact, we probably spend a lot more time thinking about you than you spend thinking about us. We\u2019re okay with that. When it comes to the current administration, the President\u2019s counterpart is of course my prime minister, and I\u2019ve been with my prime minister at a number of bilateral meetings. And I know that the two leaders have a very strong mutual respect for one another, and I would say, they also really get along. As for my U.S. counterparts, Luis and I are going to embarrass you, Rex, but it is a true pleasure working with Secretary Tillerson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHe is a tremendous friend and partner for Canada, and an incredibly important voice in maintaining the rules-based international order, and it\u2019s been a real privilege for me to work with him on issues ranging from peace and security on the North Korean Peninsula \u2013 we recently cohosted a summit in Vancouver on this issue. He was brave enough to come to Ottawa in December; that shows true friendship. And I am grateful both to Secretary Tillerson and to Secretary Videgaray that we three continental partners were able to have a really good meeting here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: </strong><em>Muchas gracias a todo</em>.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And thank you, Greg, for that very kind, warm introduction, inviting me back home today. And I want to thank those at the Clements Center of National Security and the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law for hosting the event as well.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs Greg mentioned to you, today does mark my one-year anniversary as Secretary of State. A year ago this time, I had entered the State Department, stood on the steps in the foyer, and had my first chance to have a conversation with my newest colleagues and friends in the State Department about things that are important to me and values that I wanted to bring to the State Department. And it\u2019s been a very busy, whirlwind year, but it\u2019s really nice to celebrate it among friends back home as well. So I\u2019m just delighted to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, it\u2019s always a special honor and pleasure to get to speak at your alma mater, and in particular, an institution that houses the presidential library of one of our most storied Texans to serve in Washington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLBJ bemoaned, as some of you may know, what he considered an East Coast, elitist approach to foreign policy. He once said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever get credit for anything I do in foreign affairs, no matter how successful it is, because I didn\u2019t go to Harvard.\u201d (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI didn\u2019t either, and worse, I\u2019m an engineer. (Laughter.) But I got one up on LBJ: He didn\u2019t go to the University of Texas. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have said before that this University shaped me in so many ways, both personal and professional. An interesting story: When I was a freshman in the Longhorn Band, a group of about one hundred members of the band flew down to Peru for a special mission trip. There had been a major earthquake in Peru, and enormous refugee problem coming out of the mountains into the area of Lima. And a group of Texans went down to help raise money and bring awareness to the situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt was an extraordinary trip \u2013 interestingly, first passport I got. Went to the passport office, got my first passport, first foreign country I ever visited was with the University of Texas Longhorn Band to Peru. And it was interesting; it was a very successful trip. The band was a huge hit down in Lima, and the U.S. ambassador to Peru even expressed he had some concerns that \u201cThe Eyes of Texas\u201d was going to replace \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d as the official \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 anthem at the events. Regrettably, we left for that trip after a loss at the Cotton Bowl, but the Showband of the Southwest won in Peru, I assure you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as I look to the coming weeks, when I will return to Peru on my first multi-stop visit to Latin America as Secretary of State, it does feel a bit like coming full circle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m proud today UT Austin\u2019s Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, its Mexico Center, and its host of international programs do contribute to educate students about this very important region of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis trip comes at an important time for the Western Hemisphere. This diverse region \u2013 which includes Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean \u2013 is a priority for the United States for reasons other than simply our geographic proximity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe share an interwoven history and chronology. Our nations still reflect the New World optimism of limitless discovery. And importantly, we share democratic values \u2013 values that are at the core of what we believe, regardless of the color of our passport.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd for generations, U.S. leaders have understood that building relationships with Latin American and Caribbean partners is integral to the success and prosperity of our region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 1889, at the urging of then-Secretary of State James Blaine, the United States hosted the First International Conference of American States \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s OAS, or Organization of American States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the beginning of the 20th century, President Teddy Roosevelt visited Panama \u2013 the first foreign visit of a U.S. sitting president in our history.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd during the 1960s, President Kennedy established the Alliance for Progress \u2013 his ambitious plan to strengthen economic cooperation among the United States and the hemisphere, and to, in his words, \u201celiminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, we share these same goals as the visionary leaders before us: to eliminate tyranny and to further the cause of economic and political freedom throughout our hemisphere. As 2018 begins, we have an historic opportunity to do just that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few weeks ago, the United States cohosted a ministerial with our counterparts in Canada in Vancouver. Twenty countries joined us to discuss the global threat posed by North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn April, Peru will host the Summit of the Americas to highlight our region\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption. Two months later, Canada will host the 44th G7 Summit. And at the end of this year, the G20 states will convene in Buenos Aires, the first South American city ever to host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in many ways, 2018 marks the year of the Americas. Many of the world\u2019s leaders will be in this hemisphere, and as such, the eyes of the world will turn to the Americas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today I want to focus on three pillars of engagement to further the cause of freedom throughout our region in 2018 and beyond: economic growth, security, and democratic governance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe hemisphere has significant potential for greater economic growth and prosperity. We will build upon the solid foundation of economic cooperation with our Latin American and Caribbean partners. Brazil, for instance, is the region\u2019s largest economy and the ninth largest in the world. The United States is Brazil\u2019s second-largest trading partner, with two-way trade at record highs in recent years totaling more than $95 billion in 2015.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries; 12 of those countries are in the Western Hemisphere. And every year, the United States trades almost $2 trillion worth of goods and services with Latin America and Caribbean nations, supporting more than 2.5 million jobs here at home. Instead of a trade deficit, we actually have a $14 billion trade surplus with the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut today we have an opportunity to further our economic partnership and the prosperity of the peoples in this hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important step to strengthen North American economic prosperity and integration is to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m a Texan, former energy executive, and I\u2019m also a rancher. I understand how important NAFTA is for our economy and that of the continent. But it should come as no surprise that an agreement put into place 30 years ago, before the advent of the digital age and the digital economy, before China\u2019s rise as the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2013 that NAFTA would need to be modernized.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur aim is simple: to strengthen our economy and that of all of North America, to remain the most competitive, economically vibrant region in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the hard work of our Mexican and Canadian counterparts throughout these negotiations. Last week, we concluded round six, and we will continue to work toward a modernized agreement with another round scheduled next month.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"energy\" name=\"energy\"></a>Building greater prosperity by integrating the wealth of energy resources within the hemisphere is an opportunity that is unique in the world to the Americas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past decade, North America has been leading an energy renaissance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy 2040, North America is expected to add more oil production to the global markets than the entire rest of the world combined and more gas production than any other single region. The flow of crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and electricity already crosses our borders in both directions, leading to greater reliability, more efficiency, and lower costs to consumers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur continent has become the energy force for this century, thanks in large part to rapid expansion in natural gas and tight oil production, and, of course, thanks to some great engineers, many produced right here at UT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe rest of the hemisphere can use the North American experience as a model. We see a future where energy connectivity from Canada to Chile can build out and seize upon energy integration throughout the Americas, delivering greater energy security to the hemisphere and stability to growing economies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSouth America is blessed with abundant energy resources. Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina all have significant undeveloped oil and natural gas. The United States is eager to help our partners develop their own resources safely, responsibly, as energy demand continues to grow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcuse me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur hemispheric energy trade is already beginning to meet these needs: 36 percent of U.S. liquefied natural gas exports since 2016 have landed in Latin America. That\u2019s more than any other region in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBetween now and 2030, Latin America is expected to spend at least $70 billion on new electric power generation plants to fuel economic growth. Many of those plants will be powered by natural gas. The United States should be a substantive and reliable supplier.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy building out a more flexible and robust energy system in our hemisphere, we can power our economies with affordable energy. We can lift more people out of poverty. And we can make our hemisphere the undisputed seat of global energy supply. To support and capture this opportunity requires the opening of more market economies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe opening of energy markets in Mexico, for example, has led to greater private investment, more competition, and more energy trade with the United States than ever before. Truly, a win-win.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFurther south, we are partnering with Central America to strengthen its regional electricity market and modernize its grid. Creating stronger Central American economies by lowering energy cost is critical to building a more secure Central America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have the chance to develop an energy partnership that spans the Western Hemisphere, to the benefit of all of our citizens. We cannot afford to squander this moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA transition to more market-based economic reforms are not limited to the energy sector. Argentina, under President Macri\u2019s leadership, has made monumental strides in delivering reforms to open the Argentine economy and pursue growth for all Argentinians. Its historically high inflation rate is finally decreasing. GDP is going up, spurred on by investment and soaring consumer confidence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd one week after the U.S. Congress passed landmark tax reform policy, Argentina\u2019s legislature took action to overhaul their tax system as well. All of these efforts are making the second-largest economy in South America ripe for more investment and growth. We hope more countries take a similar path \u2013 to help the entire hemisphere grow in prosperity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut for prosperity to take root, we must create the conditions for regional stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEconomic development and security reinforce each other. When individuals are living in poverty, a life of crime can look like the only opportunity available to make a living. Legal and illegal immigration increases as people look for more opportunity elsewhere. And innocent people are more likely to become victims of drug cartels, human traffickers, and corrupt law enforcement authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States approach is holistic \u2013 we must address security and development issues side by side. You cannot expect to have one without the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe most immediate threat to our hemisphere are transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs. In their pursuit of money and power, TCOs leave death and destruction in their wake. As humans, weapons, opioids, and other drugs are smuggled, law enforcement and civilians become the targets.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHere at home, Americans do not necessarily see the day-to-day violence that is \u2013 violence that is so common in other parts of our hemisphere. But U.S. demand for drugs drives this violence and this lawlessness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe acknowledge our role as the major market for illicit drug consumption and the need for shared approaches to address these challenges. The opioid epidemic we are facing in this country is a clear, tragic representation of how interconnected our hemisphere truly is. Violence and drugs do not stop at our southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat is why we continue to employ a coordinated, multilateral approach to diminish the influence of these groups. It is time we rid our hemisphere of the violence and devastation that they promote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI co-chair a high-level dialogue with Foreign Secretary Videgaray of Mexico to discuss new and strategic ways to disrupt TCOs. We must take new approaches to disrupt their business models \u2013 models of cartels which operate much like any other business organization that maximizes their value chain from feedstock to manufacturing to distribution to marketing and sales.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second meeting of our dialogue was held in Washington this past December, which included Secretary Nielsen of the Department of Homeland Security and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as our Mexican counterparts. We also had with us law enforcement representatives from both countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDismantling TCOs is not just a diplomatic issue. Obviously, it requires integrating the skills and expertise of law enforcement to interdict shipments of illegal drugs, attack the revenue streams and the weapons feeding TCOs, and to track down and prosecute the middlemen who enable them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tClose collaboration among multiple agencies \u2013 within our own government, and with our international partners \u2013 is essential. The way we combat threats to our southern border security is to work collaboratively with Mexico to strengthen Mexico\u2019s southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThrough the Merida Initiative \u2013 a partnership between the United States and Mexico focused on improving security and the rule of law \u2013 the United States is providing assistance to build the capacity of Mexican law enforcement and judicial institutions. By providing inspection equipment, canine units, and training, we equip law enforcement officers with tools to eradicate opium poppy production, tighten border security, and disrupt trafficking activities \u2013 not just in drugs but in trafficking of humans. By improving cross-border communications, we make both sides of the border safer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd our security partnerships extend beyond just our southern border or Mexico\u2019s southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tColombia has been one of our strongest partners in the region. Following decades of long internal battle with Revolutionary Forces of the FARC, Colombia has charted a pathway to peace. We continue to support this sustainable peace, but challenges do remain. Colombia is the world\u2019s largest producer of cocaine \u2013 the source of 92 percent of the cocaine seized in the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast year, and with U.S. support, Colombian police and military forces eradicated 130,000 acres of coca fields \u2013 the highest number since 2010. The same year, Colombian forces seized nearly 500 metric tons of cocaine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere is more work ahead. Regrettably, coca cultivation has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2016, more than 460,000 acres in Colombia were used for coca cultivation \u2013 a record. We remain a very \u2013 we remain and keep a very open and frank dialogue with the Government of Colombia to address the eradication of this very large feedstock for cocaine and to identify alternative cash crops to support rural Colombian farmers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Central America, through the Alliance for Prosperity, we support countries as they address security and economic development in tandem. Last June in Miami, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, along with our Mexican counterparts, cohosted the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America. Through many productive conversations with public and private sector leaders across the region, opportunities were identified to help Central American countries grow their economies, strengthen their institutions, and better protect their people. More opportunities for Central Americans will weaken the hold of transnational criminal organizations, address the underlying causes of legal and illegal immigration, and result in less violence. That makes their nations stronger, and it makes ours safer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, partners along our third border, the Gulf of Mexico, are increasing their ability to perform maritime interdictions, rein in illegal firearms, counter corruption, and prosecute criminals. Over the summer we submitted our Caribbean 2020 Plans. This comprehensive strategy fosters closer security cooperation and reaffirms our commitment to encourage private sector growth and diversification of energy resources, creating energy security in the Caribbean. We also maintain our partnerships in education and health initiatives, including PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States knows that our country \u2013 and the rest of the region \u2013 benefits from greater regional stability and the prospect of a growing economy throughout the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States\u2019 partnership with nations in the hemisphere is founded on shared values and democratic governance, but we cannot take it for granted. Many still live under the oppression of tyranny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe corrupt and hostile regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela clings to a false dream and antiquated vision for the region that has already failed its citizens. It does not represent the vision of millions of Venezuelans \u2013 or in any way comport with the norms of our Latin American, Canadian, or Caribbean partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur position has not changed. We urge Venezuela to return to its constitution \u2013 to return to free, open, and democratic elections \u2013 and to allow the people of Venezuela a voice in their government. We will continue to pressure the regime to return to the democratic process that made Venezuela a great country in the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela stands in stark contrast to the future of stability pursued by so many others in the hemisphere. The great tragedy is that although Venezuela could be one of the most prosperous countries in the region, it is one of the poorest in the world. Venezuela GDP growth in 2004 was as high as 18 percent. Ten years later, it is nearly a negative 4 percent \u2013 all the result of man-made collapse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela boasts the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, but riches are reserved only for the ruling elites. As a consequence, the people suffer. Venezuelans are starving, looting is common, and the sick do not receive the medical attention they desperately need. Venezuelans are dying of malnutrition and disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere has been no natural disaster \u2013 nothing like that earthquake that took me to Peru. The Venezuelan people suffer because of a corrupt regime that steals from its own people. The Maduro regime is squarely to blame and must be held to account.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States has imposed sanctions on more than 40 current or former Venezuelan government officials \u2013 individuals who support Maduro and his efforts to undermine democracy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past year, we have worked with many of our Latin American partners \u2013 through the Lima Group and the Organization of American States in particular \u2013 to build support for coordinated action to counter the country\u2019s slide into dictatorship. We appreciate the Lima Group of major regional leaders who have met regularly to support the Venezuelan people\u2019s quest to regain their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCanada too has sanctioned dozens of Venezuelan leaders, including Maduro himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd recently, the European Union joined the growing global chorus to sanction leaders in the regime for human rights abuses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe world is waking to the plight of the Venezuelan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe encourage all nations to support the Venezuelan people. The time has come to stand with freedom-loving nations, those that support the Venezuelan people, or choose to stand with the Maduro dictatorship, if that is your choice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tElsewhere we will continue to encourage others in the region, like Cuba, who disregard their people and ignore this democratic moment in Latin America, to give their people the freedom that they deserve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCuba has an opportunity in their own transfer of power from decades of the Castro regime to take a new direction. In June, President Trump laid out a new vision for our approach to Cuba \u2013 one that supports the Cuban people by steering economic activity away from the military, intelligence, and security service which disregard their freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe administration\u2019s policy \u2013 as written in the National Security Presidential Memorandum \u2013 also seeks to, quote, \u201censure that the engagement between the United States and Cuba advances the interests of the United States and that of the Cuban people.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt includes advancing human rights and encouraging the nascent private sector in Cuba. The future of our relationship is up to Cuba \u2013 the United States will continue to support the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela and Cuba remind us that for our hemisphere to grow and thrive, we must prioritize and promote democratic values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe must root out corruption in all of its forms. Ineffective, corrupt governance damages countries. The economy suffers. People lose faith in institutions. And crime increases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRecent steps taken against corruption in Guatemala, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil underscore the importance of directly addressing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Guatemala, we continue to support the CICIG \u2013 a UN body created in 2006 \u2013 to uphold the rule of law, strengthen accountability, and independently investigate illegal, corrupt activity affecting government institutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t2018 should be the year countries in the Western Hemisphere restore their trust with their people, the people they represent, and take serious anti-corruption action.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEarlier as I mentioned the Summit of the Americas, hosted by Peru \u2013 will be hosted by Peru in April. We wholeheartedly support this year\u2019s theme: \u201cDemocratic Governance Against Corruption.\u201d And we encourage every nation in the region to fully embrace it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEncouraging transparency, increasing accountability, rooting out corruption \u2013 all of these are essential to creating a sound economy for the region, promoting security, and protecting our values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrong institutions and governments that are accountable to their people also secure their sovereignty against potential predatory actors that are now showing up in our hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina \u2013 as it does in emerging markets throughout the world \u2013 offers the appearance of an attractive path to development. But in reality, this often involves trading short-term gains for long-term dependency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust think about the difference between the China model of economic development and the United States version.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina\u2019s offer always come at a price \u2013 usually in the form of state-led investments, carried out by imported Chinese labor, onerous loans, and unsustainable debt. The China model extracts precious resources to feed its own economy, often with disregard for the laws of the land or human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, China is gaining a foothold in Latin America. It is using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit. The question is: At what price?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina is now the largest trading partner of Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. While this trade has brought benefits, the unfair trading practices used by many Chinese have also harmed these countries\u2019 manufacturing sectors, generating unemployment and lowering wages for workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLatin American \u2013 Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people. China\u2019s state-led model of development is reminiscent of the past. It doesn\u2019t have to be this hemisphere\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRussia\u2019s growing presence in the region is alarming as well, as it continues to sell arms and military equipment to unfriendly regimes who do not share or respect democratic values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur region must be diligent to guard against faraway powers who do not reflect the fundamental values shared in this region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands in vivid contrast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe do not seek short-term deals with lopsided returns. We seek partners with shared values and visions to create a safe, secure, and prosperous hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. approach is based on mutually beneficial goals to help both sides grow, develop and become more prosperous, and do so by respecting international law, prioritizing the interests of our partners, and protecting our values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith the United States, you have a multidimensional partner \u2013 one that benefits both sides with engagement to support economic growth, education, innovation, and security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year the United States is eager to create even deeper relationships with Latin America and Caribbean partners, with the aim of expanding freedom to more people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have a tremendous opportunity to build upon our shared history, culture, and values to generate more opportunity, more stability, more prosperity, and more resilient governance in South America, Central America, North America, and the Caribbean.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this year of the Americas, the United States will continue to be the Western Hemisphere\u2019s steadiest, strongest, and most enduring partner. Thank you for your kind attention.

I\u2019m the executive director of the Clements Center and a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, a couple of your hosts for today. And honored to have so many of our students here in the audience, and we\u2019re going to be hearing from a few of those students in a little bit.\n\n\n<p>\n\tMr. Secretary, as you and I were visiting out back beforehand, we were remembering the first time we met was a couple years ago, and at that time, you were in the private sector and I had given a foreign policy speech to a group of UT alums, of whom you were in the audience. And as we recalled, you asked me some very probing questions in that \u2013 after my lecture, and I don\u2019t --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> (Laughter.) What goes around comes around, I guess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> That\u2019s right. I \u2013 the tables have turned, sir. I don\u2019t think either of us expected two years later we\u2019d be here on the one-year anniversary of being Secretary, so, anyway, so my turn to ask some questions. I\u2019m going to ask the Secretary a few questions, we\u2019ll have a colloquy here, and then we\u2019re going to hear from a few of our students as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, Mr. Secretary, I\u2019m a historian by training, and whenever I\u2019m looking at current foreign policy issues, I always like to think about the historical context. And as our history students here will know, in a few years, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, which, for a very young United States, was our assertion of \u2013 our efforts to keep European colonial powers out of the Western Hemisphere to protect our security but also to promote the three pillars of the speech you talked about today: security, liberty, and prosperity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, you as Secretary, you kind of inherit that 200-year tradition. Looking back, how would you regard the Monroe Doctrine? Has it been more of a success or a failure, especially as you look at our challenges today?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think it clearly has been a success, because as I mentioned at the top, what binds us together in this hemisphere are shared democratic values, and while different countries may express that democracy not precisely the same way we practice democracy in this country, the fundamentals of it \u2013 respect for the dignity of the human being, respect for the individual to pursue life, liberty, happiness \u2013 those elements do bind us together in this hemisphere. So I think it clearly was an important commitment at the time, and I think over the years, that has continued to frame the relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, it\u2019s easy for the United States as a country, because of our size and our engagements with so many countries and regions around the world, to, through nothing more than just perhaps a period of neglect, to let certain relationships atrophy a bit. And we\u2019ve gone \u2013 I think we\u2019ve gone through those periods of time in our history as well, and if you look back and whether \u2013 you can go by individual country or regionally as well, due to other events, sometimes I think we have forgotten about the importance of the Monroe Doctrine and what it meant to this hemisphere and maintaining those shared values. So I think it\u2019s as relevant today as it was the day it was written.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Okay, cool. John Quincy Adams would be happy to hear that, so. (Laughter.) You mentioned in your speech NAFTA and the ongoing renegotiations and efforts to bring it up to speed, and it was on the presidential campaign trail in 1980 that candidate Ronald Reagan was the first American political leader to call for a North American free trade accord, which soon thereafter became NAFTA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as you mentioned, we\u2019ve been living with this vision and this reality for quite a while. As we\u2019re \u2013 as our country is in the midst of the NAFTA renegotiations, what would you describe as the \u2013 what have been the strengths and the weaknesses of NAFTA as currently constituted?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think \u2013 again, and as I mentioned, when it was put in place 30 years ago, the world was a bit of a different place. Supply chains didn\u2019t function the way they do today \u2013 again, I mention the advent of the digital age, the digital economy, which has completely disrupted supply chains and how they function. The rise of China now as the second largest economy in the world, and China growing its economy by spreading out its own trading relationships \u2013 all of those have had an impact on NAFTA\u2019s ability to respond \u2013 the agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that\u2019s why I think \u2013 we think about it as a need to modernize the agreement. I think the strength of building upon the fact that with shared borders, there are clear efficiencies to be gained that serve all three countries well and creates more value, and that\u2019s \u2013 in the global world of competition and trade, and whether you\u2019re building automobiles or whatever you\u2019re manufacturing or whatever you\u2019re doing agriculturally, you are competing with others. And when we can integrate the strengths of these three countries that share this border \u2013 if we can lower our cost of supply by that much, we just won, we just beat the other trading partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think \u2013 and that was always the vision in the beginning, and I think where it\u2019s \u2013 where it\u2019s having trouble and struggling today is because it\u2019s not been able to respond to that outside competitive force as effectively as perhaps it should. So we\u2019re hoping we can get to a modernized agreement. I\u2019m not directly engaged in those negotiations; I stay close to them because they do intersect with our foreign policy agenda as well. I can tell you it\u2019s \u2013 these are tough negotiations, and I\u2019m sure some of you are hearing about that, but the parties are continuing to work, I think, towards a solution that serves all three countries\u2019 interests well, but then collectively achieves the subjective of collectively making us the most competitive trading entity in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>So I want to come back to another country that you mentioned towards the end of your \u2013 end of your speech, and that\u2019s Cuba, one of the two remaining tyrannies in the region along with Venezuela. President Trump has been quite critical of the Obama administration\u2019s previous normalization process with Cuba, with the Castro regime. But as you mentioned in June when the President announced some new regulations \u2013 or a few months ago, in November when he announced some new regulations, some Cuban American groups worried that those didn\u2019t go far enough in reversing the previous administration\u2019s policies. So what would you say are your strategic priorities towards Cuba going forward?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as I mentioned, they\u2019re \u2013 they will be going through a transfer of power \u2013 supposed to this year, we\u2019ll see whether it happens this year or not, but \u2013 and this will be, in all likelihood, the first transfer of power that Cuba has not been led under a Castro regime, so that we think there are opportunities, perhaps, for \u2013 an opportunity to shift towards a more open and democratic future. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to our objectives with Cuba, and the \u2013 I think President Trump\u2019s analysis \u2013 and I agree with it \u2013 of the terms with Cuba that were in place when we took office, that an awful lot had been given to the Cuban Government, and not much had been received in return, other than a clear economic opportunity for U.S. business interests, which is great.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut that was coming on the backs of the Cuban people, who are still very repressed. So we have taken a shift, we preserved a lot of that, but basically said, \u201cYes, we do want to support the Cuban people.\u201d We\u2019re not interested in supporting the Cuban regime. And as you know, the government and the security forces and others have a significant presence in almost all economic activity. So one of our objectives was to separate that and allow the Cuban people to have a more full, rewarding participation in that economy, and limit what we\u2019re \u2013 what the government is benefiting from through their ownership.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that was one of the significant changes, but again, it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s all directed at how do we help the Cuban people. That\u2019s what we want to do is help the Cuban people, and we are hopeful, and we stay \u2013 we do stay engaged with the Cuban authorities that \u2013 in this transition, can they find their way to maybe a different future? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>Yeah, we\u2019ll see. Great. Well, as a professor, I could go on all day with more and more of my questions, this and that, but I think we\u2019ll all be a little more interested to hear from some of our students. So we\u2019ve got a number of students with questions for you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>And we\u2019ve got microphones that are coming down the alleys, and all the rest of you, if you\u2019re not a student, sorry, no questions from you. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right, let\u2019s see. First one up, we\u2019ve got Patricia Zavala, so \u2013 Patricia, where are you? So \u2013 that\u2019s right, there you go. Galen, the mike to Patricia, so \u2013 and please identify your degree program and school, that\u2019s right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello, Secretary Tillerson. My name is Patricia Zavala. I\u2019m a dual-degree master\u2019s student at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, and the Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies. And my question is about corruption in Latin America, which is something that you touched on in your speech. Given the effect that corruption has in undermining public institutions and impeding the effective implementation of the administration\u2019s policy priorities, what can the U.S. do to combat the endemic corruption in the region?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, now I mentioned a number \u2013 we have a number of initiatives and funding programs working directly with individual countries \u2013 the U.S. directly but also using other UN and other international organizations to, first and foremost, strengthen the judicial systems. If we can get judicial systems and judges that are not corruptible, then you can begin to prosecute cases of corruption and punish people, and then that begins to dissuade them. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s the approach. Now, that does then raise significant risk for those judges, so hand in glove with it goes strengthening law enforcement and security in the region and in those countries to protect those who are taking action to eradicate corruption. And there is \u2013 without question, there\u2019s an intersection of a lot of the trans-criminal organizations with the corruption as well to facilitate their narcotics activities, their human trafficking activities, other kind of illicit smuggling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is quite \u2013 it\u2019s quite challenging, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in Central America with these initiatives using \u2013 and in Mexico with the Merida Initiative that I mentioned \u2013 those are all specifically targeted at exactly the issue that you\u2019re asking about, but it is strengthening judicial systems, getting judges in place that will act in accordance with their law, in some cases passing new prosecutorial laws that make it easier to prosecute corruption. A lot of these are evidentiary laws. If you don\u2019t have good evidentiary laws, you can\u2019t make the case for a prosecution \u2013 and then creating an environment where these judges can do their job, recognizing that some of them are going to come under threat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s very targeted, and we try to go country by country as to what is best needed there. But both in Mexico and in Latin America, it\u2019s a significant undertaking. That really is what\u2019s necessary to create the kind of environment then to allow economic prosperity, growth, job creation. That\u2019s what keeps everybody at home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right, thanks. All right, our next question from Juan Gonzalez-Rivera.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello, Mr. Secretary of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Hello, Juan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> My question is \u2013 first, I\u2019m a Fulbright student from Colombia. I\u2019m a candidate for PhD in chemical engineering, so my question is about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Future ExxonMobil. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> My question is about your science --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Or future State Department. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> About your science diplomacy agenda. So in your upcoming travel to Latin America, will there be a science strategic agenda to foster scientific cooperation in topics of interest to the region, or other topics of interest to the region such as food security, infectious diseases, and, of course, the environment?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think, as you point \u2013 you just touched on areas that are obvious for cooperation and scientific investigation, and certainly the \u2013 South America in particular has some incredibly rich ecology areas, things that we can learn a lot about what\u2019s happening with the environment, what\u2019s happening with the planet, what is the effect of climate change that we\u2019re seeing. And so yes, there are important joint scientific efforts for us to fund, send our own scientists there, but also bring scientists from Latin and South America to our institutions in the United States \u2013 and like yourself \u2013 to study and share, grow, and either go back home to continue that work or stay here. So it\u2019s \u2013 there are environmental issues of interest, there are diseases that are of particular interest in certain environments in particular, and that\u2019s why we have a very active PEPFAR program. As you know, it\u2019s AIDS, but it\u2019s also malaria and a few other infectious diseases that are important.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is an opportunity for us to talk about how are those collaborations that are in place going, what could we do to either strengthen those or expand them, and what new areas of investigation might be of interest to both of us. Certainly, the strong educational ties between our two countries and the fact that you\u2019re here studying at the University of Texas \u2013 and congratulations on being a Fulbright scholar \u2013 those are the strong connections that down the road \u2013 and these are the people-to-people connections \u2013 that are going to keep our countries very, very close together in terms of our values as well. And all the best to you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. Okay, another student question. We\u2019ve got Sean Salome there. The microphone\u2019s coming down. And Mr. Secretary, Sean, who\u2019s about to ask you the question, he\u2019s one of our Clements Center undergraduates. He\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s studying, but he\u2019s also a Marine vet who did a couple of deployments in Colombia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>God bless you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Good afternoon, Secretary. Thank you for having us. Colombia\u2019s facing a crossroads right now. Its neighbor to the east, Venezuela, is deteriorating as its continued government is strangulating the people. We\u2019re having mass migration of Venezuelans enter Colombia. Internally, Colombia\u2019s government and the ELN have failed peace talks, and these issues may very well lead to social unrest and economic turmoil for Colombians. How does this U.S. plan \u2013 or U.S. aid plan on aiding the Colombian people, and should the FARC be part of this process? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as you know, they have a very prescribed process to work through the implementation of the peace accord, and I would share your observation that it has stalled a bit. They were making good progress and now some areas that are important seem to have hit a pause. That\u2019s one of the areas we will be talking with the Santos government about: How can we get those restarted, continue the \u2013 we think it\u2019s important to continue to implement the peace accord if we\u2019re going to secure the peace that has been negotiated with the FARC, FLN<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou are correct in terms of Colombia is probably the most impacted country from the Venezuelan crisis. Something between 200- and 300,000 Venezuelans have now left Venezuela, living in Colombia as refugees, basically, but another couple of hundred thousand that are going back and forth all the time, just seeking food and medical treatment in particular. We have attempted to provide certain medical equipment \u2013 vaccines and others \u2013 to the Venezuelan Government so these people don\u2019t have to leave to get their treatments. The Venezuelan Government refuses to take that aid. Maduro does not want to appear that he needs it. We\u2019re going to continue to work at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is a \u2013 it\u2019s a real problem for Colombia and it has the potential to destabilize Colombia, which is why continuing to move forward on the peace implementation is so important, so it doesn\u2019t create a new area of instability and all the parties go back to their corners and we\u2019re right where we were.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have a lot of confidence in the Santos government, and we know they have elections coming up, but we believe the government is very committed to following through on implementing the peace accord. We need to encourage them and help where we can in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe problem with the coca production is \u2013 it\u2019s a significant problem. It\u2019s a problem to us, it\u2019s a shared problem. As I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t like to admit it, but we\u2019re the market. The United States accounts for the vast, vast, vast majority of illicit drug consumption in the world. And until we address that problem at home, it\u2019s a bit awkward to hold them solely accountable for being the supplier. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re working through these integrated dialogues to put the whole supply chain together. Let\u2019s own the consumption problem. We have to own that. They need to own the supply side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in Colombia we\u2019ve got a lot of issues to deal with, but we also think Colombia is an enormous country of opportunity, and they have everything they need to be wildly successful, and we believe they can be and they will be, and we just need to support them and encourage them to get on with implementing the peace accords.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for the question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. And then next question is from Alyson (ph), Alyson (inaudible). Yeah. The mike is going to you. Remember, please identify your degree program. Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Secretary Tillerson. Thanks so much for taking our questions. My name is Alyson Swadic (ph). I\u2019m a second-year master of public affairs student at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. My question is about the Merida Initiative, the security partnership between the U.S. and Mexico that you alluded to in your speech. You mentioned the importance of rule of law and fighting organized crime. Congress appropriated $2.8 billion to the Merida Initiative in 2008, but there\u2019s $1 billion left to spend. How do you think the U.S. should best spend that money in order to promote security for both nations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, in order to spend the money we also need the cooperation with the Mexican Government of where \u2013 where do they agree we can help them the most. So oftentimes the pace of that is coming to agreement with them on where they are willing, and we can work with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe continue to believe that we can provide them significant training in law enforcement because they need \u2013 they need more law enforcement personnel, training of people to build their forces up, and new kinds of training to deal with the cartels in particular. Regrettably, the cartels are \u2013 have become more powerful. They are extremely well armed. Most of those arms are coming from the United States. So we have a huge weapons interdiction effort underway as well. This is why we have Department of Homeland Security involved. Interestingly, for about every 10 trucks that we inspect coming north, because we\u2019re worried about what\u2019s coming to see us, we only inspect one truck going south. And so we have committed to them that we will do a better job of interdicting weapons flowing in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\u2019s \u2013 it is through this joint dialogue we\u2019re having with them to identify looking at what is \u2013 what are all elements of this supply chain? Where can we best attack that? What are the capabilities we need? And then we have some funds to address that. So it is going to be, I think, law enforcement, some ability to \u2013 for them to collect intelligence themselves on where these labs are. We destroyed, I think, about 134 labs last year through some information sharing, and when we identify them, the Mexican forces have been going in to destroy those. So I think we have a \u2013 or we\u2019ve got, unfortunately, too many opportunities where we can apply the joint effort, and we have the resources, the money, to do that. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Thanks. All right. All right. Another student question. Yeah, Evan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secretary Tillerson, thank you very much. My name is Evan McCormick. I\u2019m a post-doctoral fellow at the Clements Center. During the political crisis in Venezuela last year, the State Department vocally backed the Organization for American States\u2019 criticisms of the Venezuelan electoral system. In December, however, the State Department recognized the re-election of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez in spite similar \u2013 in spite of similar criticisms from the OAS regarding electoral irregularities and calling for or recommending a new election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy question is: What is the Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding support for free and fair democratic elections in the Americas, and will it work with the OAS in ensuring that those democratic standards are respected equally across the hemisphere?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, our position\u2019s the same in every country. And in the case of the Honduran elections, we also looked at other organizations\u2019 assessment of the election in terms of was it conducted in a free and fair way, was the election legitimate. In terms of why the OAS came to a different conclusion \u2013 which was actually different than the original conclusion they came to, they changed their position \u2013 I\u2019d refer you to the OAS to ask them. But we did look at the circumstances of the election. We concluded it was conducted fairly. And I think there\u2019s no \u2013 and I want to be clear here. There can be no comparison between the election process that was conducted in Honduras and the election process that\u2019s going on in Venezuela. They\u2019re nowhere close to one another. Thank you for the question, though.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right, okay. And one more student question. Let\u2019s do Abigail (ph). Right there, Diana (ph). Yeah, thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for spending part of your day with us. My name is Abigail Griffin and I am senior studying Plan II Honors government and Middle Eastern languages and cultures. I have a question regarding Venezuela. So a commonly proposed solution to a lot of the problems in the country is the removal of President Maduro from power. In your opinion, is this removal necessary, and what could the U.S.\u2019s role be in the possible regime change, especially considering the turmoil that could surmount from such a change?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, President Maduro could choose to just leave. I mean, that would \u2013 (laughter). That\u2019d be the easiest. We have not advocated for regime change or removal of President Maduro; rather, we have advocated that they return to the constitution. We do not recognize the constituent assembly as legitimate, and they need to get back to the constitution and follow the constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe \u2013 I think there will be a change. We want it to be a peaceful change. Peaceful transitions, peaceful regime change is always better than the alternative of violent change. In the history of Venezuela and in fact the history in other Latin American and South American countries, oftentimes it\u2019s the military that handles that, that when things are so bad that the military leadership realizes they just \u2013 they can\u2019t serve the citizens anymore, they will manage a peaceful transition. Whether that will be the case here or not, I do not know. Again, our position is Maduro should get back to his constitution and follow it. And then, if he is not re-elected by the people, so be it. And if the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s got some friends over in Cuba that can give him a nice hacienda on the beach, and he can have a nice life over there. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. Well, our time is drawing to the close. I know the Secretary needs to head off on the next leg of his very ambitious journey here. But Mr. Secretary, one final question from the moderator here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a native Texan, you know here that here in Texas we have very strong concerns about border security, and I can \u2013 I think I can speak for almost everyone here in the room that when we look at our state\u2019s borders, especially SUT folks, our biggest concern is the threat from Oklahoma. (Laughter.) So especially the Sooners football team. So you\u2019ve got a captive audience. What advice do you have for Coach Herman, and what are we going to do to beat OU this fall? (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think I can help him. (Laughter.) We just need to get in place a visa program for the Red River \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and we just won\u2019t issue any visas to the Oklahoma football team. (Laughter and applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> I\u2019m really not worried. I\u2019m really not worried because University of Texas is going to beat Oklahoma this year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> There\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s headline. All right, okay. (Applause.) All right, okay. All right, all right. Everybody please join me in welcoming and thanking Secretary Tillerson. Thank you so much, sir. That was awesome. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd everybody, before you leave, we\u2019ve got a little sendoff for you from the Secretary\u2019s \u2013 the Secretary\u2019s old bandmates, his old friends. So stay with us for a couple minutes. Can\u2019t leave without a song. So that\u2019s right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(A song is performed.)

We also applaud Canada\u2019s efforts to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through strategic partnerships that seek to tackle challenges faced by women across the globe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur conversations over the past few days have been very productive, and the U.S. remains committed to working closely with our G7 partners on all of the critical issues that we discussed, and we look forward to our leaders building upon our conversations when they gather in Charlevoix in June for the G7 leaders\u2019 conference.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmong the number of shared priorities discussed is our collective commitment to counter transnational terrorists and the criminal networks supporting them. While we have made significant gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in cyberspace and in other countries, we cannot stand idly by and assume that it is defeated. We must remain vigilant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also remain united in opposition to the DPRK\u2019s continued development of unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs. We call for all countries around the world to take action and reinforce this message to Pyongyang and to rigorously enforce the UN Security Council resolutions. International unity is essential as we continue to push diplomatic and economic pressure until the DPRK concedes to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe G7 countries reaffirm our message to Iran to adhere to international norms and strictly abide by its nuclear-rated \u2013 nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. The United States calls on all of our partners to continue working alongside us as we counter Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and hold the Iranian Government accountable for their actions: supporting terrorist organizations, launching cyber attacks, threatening international shipping interests, and committing unconscionable human rights abuses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSyria was another prominent topic of discussion. On April 13th, the United States, France, and the UK launched strikes on three targets in Syria. These military actions taken together with our allies were a response to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons to kill and injure hundreds of its own people. The images of dead and dying children following the Syrian regime\u2019s most recent chemical attack represented a call to action among the world\u2019s civilized nations. The response of the United States and our key partners was not simply to hold Assad and other Syrian regime officials accountable for the atrocities committed, but also to degrade the regime\u2019s capability to commit them and to deter the use of chemical weapons in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe want to ensure that malicious regimes and terrorists understand this message of deterrence. We\u2019re committed to completing the fight against ISIS and rooting out its remaining havens. The U.S. will remain committed in Syria until ISIS is defeated and the so-called caliphate completely eliminated. We will work to ensure local\u00a0forces enabled by our regional partners and allies will consolidate these gains, stabilize liberated territories, and prevent the return of ISIS. We will not leave a vacuum that can be exploited by the Assad regime and its supporters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn parallel, we will work with our partners to invigorate the Geneva political process pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and to mobilize the resources needed to address Syria\u2019s urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs. We will seek further contributions in forces, materiel, and money from regional partners and allies in order to sustain the effort in Syria and stabilize liberated territories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we work to advance the political process, the United States is committed to ensuring that all Syrians, including the Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians, Turkmen, and other minorities in northeast Syria, have a full seat at the table and an appropriate say in their future pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe G7 countries agree that Russia must stop creating impediments to peace and abide by the commitments it entered into under UN Security Council Resolution 2401 and compel the Assad regime to do the same. Russia must be a constructive partner in Syria or will be held accountable. We also stand united in our commitment to hold Russia accountable for its activities in Ukraine. Together, the G7 call on Russia to honor its Minsk commitments, to de-escalate violence, and to return control of Crimea to Ukraine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the issues of collective concern I\u2019ve just outlined, over the past few days we also discussed our solidarity on Venezuela, Libya, and many other critical issues on the forefront of the international agenda, including the humanitarian crisis in Burma. Nearly 700,000 people, mostly Rohingya women and children, have fled violence in Burma since August, bringing the total number of refugees hosted in Bangladesh to approximately one million.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn response to this dire situation, I am announcing today that we are providing an additional $50 million in humanitarian assistance from our Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration to support a UN-led joint response plan in Bangladesh. This brings the United States response to the Rakhine State crisis in Burma and Bangladesh to more than $163 million since August 2017 and total humanitarian assistance for displaced people in and from Burma to more than $255 million since October 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis assistance will support refugees in Bangladeshi host communities to provide protection, emergency shelter, water, sanitation, health care, and psychological support for people affected by the conflict, as well as to prepare for the impending monsoon and cyclone season, which has the potential to bring significant loss of life, shelter, and access to critical services. We urge other donors to join us in providing additional humanitarian assistance for those affected by this crisis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith those observations on the topics we\u2019ve covered here at the G7 ministerial meeting, I look forward to taking your questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. And with that, we\u2019ll start with Dave Clark from AFP. Dave, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you. Thank you very much. You mentioned in your comments that the G7 members agreed on the importance of holding Iran to its commitments under the JCPOA. Were you able to give a commitment to your allies here that the United States will live up to its commitments under the JCPOA, and in particular to maintain the sanctions waiver on the nuclear-related sanctions after May the 12th? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Thank you. Well, as you know, this has been a topic of discussion with our E3 partners. The United States has significant concerns with Iran and its ballistic missiles program, its destabilizing and malign influence in the region \u2013 in Yemen, in Syria, and elsewhere \u2013 and concerns we have with the JCPOA itself, including its sunset clauses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump is concerned, very concerned, about Iran\u2019s behavior, malign behavior. His ultimate concern with the JCPOA is the concern for nonproliferation. We \u2013 no one wants to see a nuclear-armed Iran. President Trump\u2019s goal in this entire process is to strengthen the JCPOA if it can be strengthened and to protect America and American interests which have been threatened for over 40 years by the regime in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve lived through my family with. My uncle was the last U.S. ambassador to Iran. He left Tehran \u2013 fortunately for him and my family \u2013 in the summer of 1979 before his staff was taken hostage on November 4th, 1979 and held in violation of all international norms and basic, basic human dignity, for 444 days by that regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re well aware of the problems and the destabilizing and malign influence of Iran, and the President is committed to addressing it. We have discussed that at length with our partners here at the G7 ministerial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you. And our next question goes to Mike Blanchfield from the Canadian Press. Hi, Mike.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Mr. Secretary, we heard earlier today from Boris Johnson and Chrystia Freeland on the G7 efforts on \u2013 to call out Russia for its interference in democratic institutions. They\u2019ve talked about a working group that is going to report to the leaders and going to urge them to speak out against the influence of Russia. Russia is a politically charged topic in your country, obviously, especially with the Mueller investigation. How \u2013 how committed is your government to this G7 endeavor, and how likely is it that we\u2019ll see President Trump here in Charlevoix standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these G8 \u2013 the G7 leaders in calling out Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Well, you made a reference there \u2013 you caught yourself when referring to the G8. It\u2019s no longer the G8 for a reason. It\u2019s the G7. We\u2019re committed to addressing all of the abhorrent behavior that we have witnessed particularly recently by Russia, whether it\u2019s at Salisbury, its support for the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has not just undertaken with its \u2013 with its allies and partners in the G7 to make statements about this behavior; we have undertaken significant actions in response. As you know, we expelled a large number of undeclared Russian intelligence agents from the United States, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian oligarchs and Russian institutions, enterprises. So we have taken action. We stand with our G7 allies in confronting Russian malign behavior where \u2013 wherever we see it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, we also want to work with Russia in areas where we can and need to work with Russia, whether it\u2019s on stability, New START talks, INF Treaty \u2013 treaty violation, actually, by the Russians which we need to \u2013 need to address, counterterrorism. There are any number of areas where we still need to have a dialogue with Russia, but that will not prevent us from standing up and confronting and taking action against Russian behavior that\u2019s contrary to international norms and all that we stand for in the G7. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Sir, thank you. Thank you, everyone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

So thank you very much. One second. Sir, come on up. Thank you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s start our first question with the Associated Press\u2019s Matt Lee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. I realize that this report doesn\u2019t cover the United States and \u2013 but in this preface and in his comments just now, Acting Secretary Sullivan talked about how the U.S. is promoting \u2013 promotes and defends rights, and that that\u2019s central to us as a country, and that the United States will lead other nations by example in promoting rule of law and respect for human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering how effective you think that you can be in leading by example when you take \u2013 you accuse numerous \u2013 there \u2013 a lot of countries of, say, assaults on press freedom when here, in this country, we have a President who routinely excoriates the press, calling individual media outlets \u2013 and individual reporters sometimes \u2013 fake news. I\u2019m wondering how you can criticize countries for discrimination against LGBT people when this administration\u2019s stated policy is to exclude transgender people from serving in the military. I\u2019m wondering about discrimination of \u2013 criticism of other countries for discriminating against religious minorities when courts and a lot of critics see the travel ban as, in fact, a ban on one particular religion. And lastly, you criticize countries for the mistreatment and refoulement of refugees, which I suppose this administration is not in that great of a position to do because it doesn\u2019t accept hardly any refugees, or at least far fewer than it ever did before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how is this not \u2013 how do you not open yourself up to charges of hypocrisy, and how effective do you think you can be at leading by example? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s see if I can remember each one of those. But I think as you go through the report, you\u2019ll see the countries that we criticize for limiting press freedom, it\u2019s for things like having criminal libel laws where you can be put in jail for what you say. It\u2019s for things like yanking the licenses of media outlets you don\u2019t like or, in many cases, killing the journalists. So I think we make quite a distinction between political leaders being able to speak out and say that that story was not accurate or using even stronger words sometimes, and using state power to prevent the journalists from continuing to do their work. So I think there\u2019s an example there, and we\u2019ve used that with many of our colleagues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe other end of your stream was refoulement, which is a legal term. It\u2019s sending somebody back to a place where they are \u2013 where you know they\u2019re going to be persecuted or where they have a well-founded fear of persecution without going through due process to assess the risk to them. And of course, our law provides that people have rights of appeal through the immigration courts system and into the federal courts if they think they\u2019re going to be. So it doesn\u2019t go to the quantity of refugees; it goes to whether you\u2019re --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, I understand. But you\u2019re not in a position if you even wanted to refoule a refugee, you don\u2019t have many to do it to. But it\u2019s also mistreatment of refugees. It\u2019s not just that. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah, and that usually involves, as you\u2019ll find documented in many countries in the report, physical mistreatment of refugees and that kind of thing. Your --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> LGBT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> LGBT. As we are very clear in the reports, and this has been U.S. policy for some time, the things we\u2019re focused on are is: Has the government in question criminalized same-sex sexual activity, and that\u2019s highlighted now right up front in the reports; have they failed to prevent violence against people because of their LGBT status, or the same applies to ethnic groups and religious and so on; and then, third, discrimination in housing, employment, and government services. Usually, military and police are a slightly different form of government employment. So you can have a debate about that one, but most of the other countries where we\u2019re criticizing them, I think we would be very happy if they were following the procedures we are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of policy decisions in these areas that governments make that aren\u2019t internationally recognized human rights, so that\u2019s where we try to distinguish. And that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s nothing new. That\u2019s been the case in the last couple of administrations as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michelle from CNN.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I\u2019d like to know if you think that such statements in the United States weaken the impact of this report, because the American President has called the press an enemy of the people. And I think at one point he called for a closer look at libel laws or something like that. Do you think in the eyes of people that are looking at this report, as an example and as a resource, do statements like that currently weaken its impact?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think the report is very clear about the kinds of things that we consider to be inappropriate restrictions on freedom of the media \u2013 as I mentioned, using the legal system to go after members of the press, using physical force and so on. It doesn\u2019t go to the nature of discourse in a country. And you can have your own judgments as to how \u2013 how strong a statement might or might not be, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have a hard time explaining that in a lot of places. When you talk to some of my friends in Cuba, for example, who try to be independent journalists there and are routinely slapped around, they also get called names, but they \u2013 I think if it were limited to that they\u2019d be pretty happy as compared to the situation now. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when the State Department is talking about this represents our values as Americans, the removal of sections on women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 why is that not included in values as Americans?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> There\u2019s still a long section on women. And by the way, if you look elsewhere in the report, I mean, women are also activists, are also journalists. There are \u2013 yeah, now --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Understood. But it\u2019s so conspicuous that it\u2019s removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Let me \u2013 now, it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to explain why it was removed. It was introduced six years ago into the report. It hadn\u2019t been there before. The \u2013 it\u2019s one of the few terms that are used in the report that isn\u2019t derived from an international treaty that has a definition or derived from U.S. law, where there\u2019s a clear definition to the term.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in this case, the previous administration intended it to mean look at the availability of contraception, at the \u2013 whether the government tried to impose or coerce people in making decisions about reproduction. In the statements that were made \u2013 this was derived from the Beijing Declaration that was done in the \u201890s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt that time, it was very clear and our delegation made a very clear statement that this has nothing to do with abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion. Unfortunately, over the last few years, groups on both sides of that issue domestically have started to use the term, and both seem to think it does include abortion and then argue about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo our thought was let\u2019s just not use a term that has the opposite meaning from the one we intend. We went back to the term that\u2019s used in the U.S. statute that requires the Human Rights Report, which is coerced family planning, namely coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI might mention too, because I went back and looked at last year\u2019s report, the question being asked was, \u201cWere there obstacles opposed to getting contraception information and means?\u201d The answer in virtually every country was no, there were no obstacles other than, in almost every country, including our own, the availability in rural areas is less than it is in urban areas. But we were taking a lot of space to explain that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve kept that information in there. We\u2019ve done it now by a hyperlink. We used to take that information from the WHO report and put it in. We said let\u2019s just use a hyperlink, and then there\u2019s actually more information available that way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the rationale behind that. It\u2019s not a diminishment of women\u2019s rights or a desire to get away from it; it was to stop using a term that has several different meanings that are not all the ones we intend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Dave Clark from AFP.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you very much. When countries around the world are looking at the U.S. for leadership on human rights, should they be looking at this report, or should they be looking at President Trump\u2019s embrace of Rodrigo Duterte, of meeting with Sisi, and with the very warm relations with Mohammed bin Salman, who runs a country where women have no rights at all? Is \u2013 what sends the stronger signal, the President\u2019s close personal friendship with Xi Jinping and his golf tours at Mar-a-Lago or you at that podium decrying human rights abuses?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, this is a official report, and by the way, I think it\u2019s one of the most widely read U.S. Government documents in the world when we do the hit counts on the internet. It\u2019s put out in the name of the Secretary of State, who was just here to deliver it, and he certainly is reflecting the President in this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think this is showing what we assess to be the human rights situation in all of the countries you\u2019ve just mentioned, including \u2013 now even more so \u2013 the responsibility of the government for the abuses that are occurring there. They\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not just saying there are these societal problems in the country; we\u2019re saying the government either has done these bad deeds or not. And I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Russia we highlighted the fact \u2013 their response to an increase in domestic violence there \u2013 and they have a terrible problem, I mean tens of thousands of deaths of women being killed in domestic disputes every year. But since it went up, the government spokesman who went into the State Duma said, \u201cWell, we have to decriminalize this, because it\u2019s better that our women be beaten than that our men be humiliated by their behavior.\u201d So \u2013 and this was Putin\u2019s party, they decriminalized spousal beating. So not a very good thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, does that mean that the President should never speak to these people? This is what \u2013 we\u2019re trying to keep the report as the factual baseline for what we\u2019re going to do in policy terms or sanctions as the secretary was mentioning. So we can learn a lot from this, and we can use it to formulate a policy. But usually part of your policy is engaging with the people whose behavior you\u2019re trying to change at some level. And I don\u2019t think those two things are in distinction. The fact is, these other governments and their populations do read the report, and I don\u2019t think they discount it because the President speaks with their leader or otherwise. And when the President speaks to their leader, often he\u2019s talking about these issues, so it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s complementary, it\u2019s not a \u2013 two things that are in conflict\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Since we\u2019re citing examples, what does Saudi law say about spousal abuse?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Saudi law is very, very restrictive on women. We\u2019ve tried to encourage changes in that, we\u2019ve seen the minor changes that are reflected in the report, that they\u2019ve started to say they\u2019re going to allow women to drive cars and so on. That isn\u2019t very much, but it is a baby step in the right direction, and we\u2019re trying to encourage more of that kind of reform at the same time that we\u2019re calling out the areas in which they\u2019re deficient, which are many.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>All right, Rich Hudson from Fox News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks, Heather. Ambassador, I want to follow up a little bit on Saudi Arabia, the conversation you were just having with Dave. You note in the report \u2013 and a lot has happened on the government level in Saudi Arabia in just the past year, and you note in the report the jailing or hoteling of 200 officials there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Yep. Hoteling, that\u2019s a good \u2013 (laughter).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are you \u2013 overall, in Saudi Arabia, are you encouraged by some of the things that are happening? Are you discouraged by what\u2019s happened over the last year? Where do you see the trend going in Saudi Arabia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, of course it\u2019s always hard to predict trends, but I think \u2013 I\u2019m always encouraged when you start to see things break out of a static holding pattern. When you see a little bit of change as we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia, and the hoteling was connected to \u2013 ostensibly anyway \u2013 to more of concern about corruption, which is not \u2013 another one of our issues, insofar as corruption and human rights abuse seem to \u2013 tend to go together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re trying to encourage that kind of movement on the part of the Saudis. At the same time, you can look at that and say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t do this with sufficient due process,\u201d and I think that\u2019s also well spelled-out here. So it\u2019s trying to get that right balance of, hey here\u2019s where we think you\u2019re deficient, but we\u2019re seeing some movement and we\u2019re trying to encourage the movement in the positive direction and see more. But I\u2019m usually more encouraged when I see some movement going on than when things are just stuck in the same rut for years and years and years. So in that sense, at least there\u2019s an opportunity there. We\u2019ll see if it comes to anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>So is hoteling now going to be standard language in --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>I think your colleague just came up with a new term with --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Cindy with Voice of America. We have a few minutes left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, thank you. We were talking about press freedoms, and you\u2019re probably aware that in Nicaragua, the Ortega Government ordered at least five television stations off the air for their coverage of massive protests. What is the U.S. Government prepared to do to stem this new wave of repression?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, Nicaragua is \u2013 and I think if you looked at the report \u2013 is going to wrong direction on many fronts and that is one of them, of media freedom. But also on all the basics, I mean, it\u2019s a long litany of torture, extrajudicial killing, the elections were a sham. And so we\u2019ve put more and more pressure on \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see some of the sanctions programs will start to affect some people in that country. But it\u2019s a tough one; the Ortega Government has basically shut down a lot of the opposition, a lot of the independent civil society organizations as well as the free media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I mean, in our policy everywhere, and certainly in Nicaragua, is to try to provide both moral \u2013 and to the extent we can support NGOs and so on that are working to keep \u2013 to help them keep working, help free media keep working, and bring about a change in that dimension. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s tough, but we can\u2019t do it ourselves. We have to be in a position of supporting the people in those countries that are trying to bring about change, and we try to do that through a variety of means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he met with any Nicaraguans \u2013 but at the Summit of the Americas had meetings with civil society activists from Cuba, Venezuela \u2013 same camp as Nicaragua \u2013 and it was in part just to give them that \u2013 show that we stand with them and that we\u2019re trying to be supportive of what they\u2019re trying to do to bring about change in their own country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question about Gaza and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Janne. Janne, go right \u2013 excuse me, Janne, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korean human rights issues, as the North Korean nuclear issue is an important issue and the North Korean human rights is also serious issues, unless the regime of the North Korean Kim Jong-un changes, the North Korean human rights abuse against the North Korean people will continue. What is the U.S. solutions on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay. We have \u2013 I mean, we are concerned about the nuclear issue in North Korea, but we\u2019re equally concerned about the human rights issues, and they both derive from the same problem. And I think you see in the report we\u2019ve laid out pretty starkly the kinds of abuses, and over the last year or two, we\u2019ve supported, like, a commission of inquiry on North Korea, we support NGOs that are working on North Korea and exposing the human rights abuses that occur in the camps there and so on. But some of the stories that are contained in the report are just overwhelming. There\u2019s one about 11 people who were arrested for supposedly making a pornographic film and they were executed by shooting anti-artillery weapons at them, and then they brought out tanks and ran over the bodies, and this is supposed to be a civilized country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t think you will see a diminishment in our concern about that issue even as we try to work the nuclear issue. It\u2019s not a trade-off. I think the President\u2019s laid out a vision there that North Korea can get on a much better path, but it needs to make progress across the board, not just on one issue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, thank you. Sir, you \u2013 the report considers China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea forces of instability. What do you mean by that? And will there be any consequences?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve called them as forces of instability in the report. Perhaps --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, in the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> In the preface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> In the preface. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, exactly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think that has to do with their international behavior as well as their internal behavior. I mean, sometimes, internal behavior \u2013 you can\u2019t really separate them because when you start oppressing your own people, you generate refugee flows, you generate humanitarian crises like you\u2019re seeing in Venezuela, for example. So \u2013 but there\u2019s not \u2013 saying something is a force of instability is saying or characterizing a set of facts. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a prescribed policy flow. None of this does.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis report doesn\u2019t say countries that reach a certain level we\u2019re going to cut off aid or something like that. It\u2019s the factual predicate for making those decisions, but those are policy decisions where the President and his advisors will have to weigh a whole number of factors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> And our final question --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask \u2013 can I ask a question on the Gaza and the West Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> -- Kylie from CBS News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because, I mean, he pointed to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just go back to the reproductive rights for a second? So you said there are no obstacles for women to get contraception in any country except for if there\u2019s a remote issue, right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> I said with some exceptions, and the exceptions were and still are \u2013 and we\u2019ve really gotten at it by flipping back to the original U.S. statutory language. It\u2019s in places like China, where in order to enforce their two \u2013 now two-child policy, that there are reports of coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization. In North Korea, where the government also coerces or forces abortion \u2013 although sometimes that\u2019s for political punishment rather than family planning. And we uncovered it \u2013 so as we were digging through trying to reduce the bulk of some of this report, I found in the old country I served in, in Belarus, that it turns out that the doctors in the state hospitals, and particularly in the institutions there, if they have a woman who is pregnant and who is a woman with disabilities, the doctors insist on an abortion. Or if they believe the fetus has a disability, they\u2019ll insist on an abortion. So we\u2019ve called that out too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not \u2013 those were the cases, though, in the \u2013 under the previous formula where you would say there was a restriction on family planning, freedom of family planning. For most countries, it said, there isn\u2019t any restriction except for the ones imposed by economics and rural-urban type thing. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So just to be clear just on that, so taking out the language about those cases therefore means that the U.S. doesn\u2019t believe that the inability for women to get an abortion physically or by law is an abuse of human rights?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> That \u2013 correct under the previous administration and this one and the one before that. We have never taken the position that abortion was a right under \u2013 a human right under international law. This is supposed to be internationally recognized human rights, and it\u2019s an issue on which \u2013 some countries prohibit abortion, some countries, like our own, pretty much no restriction on it, and we don\u2019t say one of those is right and one of those is wrong. We don\u2019t report on it because it\u2019s not a human right. It\u2019s an issue of great policy debate, you can have a good discussion, but there\u2019s no internationally recognized standard as to what\u2019s the right treatment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the other, yes. The \u2013 it is internationally recognized that somebody shouldn\u2019t coerce you to have an abortion or force you to be sterilized, so that\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Thank you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question on the Palestinian --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We \u2013 the ambassador has to go. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, one quick question on the Palestinian (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We have to go. Sir, thank you. Thank you. We\u2019ll get you another time.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for coming, especially on a Friday. Today the State Department released the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Promoting freedom \u2013 promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms are central to who we are as a country, and the United States will continue to support those around the world struggling for human dignity and liberty.\n\n\n<p>\n\tThis is the 42nd annual Human Rights Report that the department has now released. We\u2019re delighted to have our Acting Secretary of State, John Sullivan, with us here today to say a few words about this report. After Acting Secretary Sullivan\u2019s remarks, we will invite Ambassador Michael Kozak to the podium to answer some of your questions. I will help facilitate, as we all know one another, and assist with that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak is a senior bureau official with the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and he\u2019s looking forward to speaking with you shortly. He has served this department under Republican and Democrat administrations for 46 years, which is incredible. Sir, thank you for your service to the State Department.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will hand over the podium to our Acting Secretary John Sullivan. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN: </strong>Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s an honor to be here to formally release the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Now in their 42nd year, these reports are a natural outgrowth of our values as Americans. The founding documents of our country speak to unalienable rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law \u2013 revolutionary concepts at the time of our founding that are now woven into the fabric of America and its interests both at home and abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPromoting human rights and the idea that every person has inherent dignity is a core element of this administration\u2019s foreign policy. It also strengthens U.S. national security by fostering greater peace, stability, and prosperity around the world. The Human Rights Reports are the most comprehensive and factual accounting of the global state of human rights. They help our government and others formulate policies and encourage both friends and foes to respect the dignity of all individuals without discrimination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, we have sharpened the focus of the report to be more responsive to statutory reporting requirements and more focused on government action or inaction with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights. For example, each executive summary includes a paragraph to note the most egregious abuses that occurred in a particular country, including those against women, LGBTI persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous persons, and members of religious minorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBefore I turn the podium over to Mike, I\u2019d like to discuss a few countries in particular, including some with the most egregious human rights records.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe entire world is aware of the horrendous human rights abuses in Syria, including barrel bombing of civilians, attacks on hospitals, widespread reports of rape and abuse by Syrian Government personnel. A week ago, the President took action, together with our French and British allies, to deter the use of chemical weapons and protect the human rights of Syrian civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe condemn the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Burma and the atrocities committed against them, and we are working with partners to address that crisis. More than 670,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in recent months. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been internally displaced. Those responsible for the violations, abuses, and attacks must be held accountable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe DPRK is one of the most repressive and abusive regimes in the world. As the report makes clear, the Kim regime systematically neglects the well-being of its people to underwrite and fund its illicit weapons programs via forced labor, child labor, and the export of North Korean workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina continues to spread the worst features of its authoritarian system, including restrictions on activists, civil society, freedom of expression, and the use of arbitrary surveillance. The absence of an independent judiciary, the government\u2019s crackdown in independent lawyers, and tight controls on information undermine the rule of law. We\u2019re particularly concerned about the efforts of Chinese authorities to eliminate the religious, linguistic, and cultural identities of Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists, as well as restrictions on the worship of Christians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian people continue to suffer at the hands of their leaders. The right of peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression are the legitimate expectation of all individuals worldwide. Unfortunately for the Iranian people, these human rights are under attack almost daily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Turkey, the detention of tens of thousands of individuals, including journalists and academics, under an ongoing state of emergency has undermined the rule of law there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Venezuela, the Maduro regime represses the human rights of its people and denies them the right to have a voice in their government. Thousands flee their homes daily in response to this growing humanitarian crisis. At the Summit of the Americas last week, Vice President Pence announced $16 million in humanitarian aid from the United States to help those who have fled Venezuela, are in \u2013 and are in desperate need of food, water, and medical help. We stand by the Venezuelan people even as their leaders refuse to allow aid into the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, the Russian Government continues to quash dissent and civil society, even while it invades its neighbors and undermines the sovereignty of Western nations. We once again urge Russia to end its brutal occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, to halt the abuses perpetrated by Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and to address impunity for the human rights violations and abuses in the Republic of Chechnya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat\u2019s a brief overview of the factual reports on countries of most concern. I know that Ambassador Kozak will be happy to answer any questions you may have, but before I turn the podium over to him, let me note at least a few bright spots.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUzbekistan \u2013 although there\u2019s still much progress to be made, the country has pursued a strategic reform agenda with positive effects on human rights, including the release of eight high-profile prisoners last year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Liberia, the recent presidential election represents a milestone marking the first peaceful transition from one democratically elected leader to another in more than 70 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Mexico, the general law on forced disappearances established criminal penalties for persons convicted of forced disappearance and a national framework to find victims.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese represent a few of the more positive examples noted in the reports which are released today. We hope to see many more positive accounts of countries taking serious action to improve the human rights record in the reports next year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn conclusion, let me say America leads the way globally to promote human rights. We will also continue to impose consequences on those who abuse human rights. Over the past year, through the Russia Magnitsky and Global Magnitsky sanctions programs, we have undertaken some of our most aggressive measures yet. No human rights abuser, no matter where in the world, is out of our reach. The Human Rights Reports are a significant part of that overall effort. Creating them is an enormous undertaking and not for the fainthearted. I\u2019m grateful to so many of my colleagues in the State Department, including those here in Washington and many others in embassies and consulates around the world, who\u2019ve made these reports possible and contribute to America\u2019s longstanding leadership in promoting human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019d like to turn the podium over to Acting Under Secretary Nauert and to my friend and colleague, Ambassador Mike Kozak. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you, Shaun. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for this on-the-record conference call. We have with us Dr. Peter Navarro, who\u2019s the assistant to the President for trade and manufacturing policy and director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. He is joined by Ambassador Tina Kaidanow. She is the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs here at the Department of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe call today will be on the updated Conventional Arms Transfer policy and Unmanned Aerial Systems export policy. This call is on the record, but I\u2019d note that the contents of the call will be embargoed until the Conventional Arms Transfer policy is posted on the White House website at approximately 12:00 p.m. today, Thursday, April 19.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019d also like to note that we have with us on the phone Mr. Gregory Kausner. He\u2019s the deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. He\u2019s able to participate with us today. He will be happy to field any questions that are addressed to the DSCA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dr. Navarro. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Thank you. I want to start by thanking the Department of State and the National Security Council for all their tremendous work leading this process over the past year, along with all our interagency partners. This collaboration underscores the President\u2019s vision that economic security is national security. The fact is our allies and partners want to buy American. They know American industries produce the most technologically sophisticated, accurate, and effective defense systems in the world. When we enable our allies and partners to more easily obtain appropriate American defense articles and services, we improve our national security. Partners who procure American weaponry are more capable of fighting alongside us and ultimately more capable of protecting themselves with fewer American boots on the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tProviding our allies and partners with greater access to American arms will also reduce their reliance not just on Chinese knockoffs, but also on Russian systems, consistent with the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. For too long we have hamstrung ourselves and limited our ability to provide our allies and partners with the defensive capabilities they require, even when in the U.S. interest. President Trump\u2019s new CAT policy, which reforms the myopic 2014 policy of his predecessor, will ensure that American interests are put first in our own decision making.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe administration\u2019s UAS export policy will level the playing field by enabling U.S. firms to increase their direct sales to authorized allies and partners. By expanding international sales opportunities, U.S. industry will be further incentivized to do what they do best: invest and innovate. This will keep our defense industrial base in the vanguard of emerging defense technologies while creating thousands of additional jobs with good wages and generating substantial export revenues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. aerospace and defense industries contribute almost a trillion dollars annually to our economy and support about 2.5 million jobs while maintaining a significant global trade surplus. As President Trump works to balance our trade with the rest of the world, further strengthening a critical part of our export economy and defense industrial base is a logical and critical step.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ll now turn it over to Ambassador Kaidanow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Thanks very much. Actually, I\u2019m going to leave that statement because I think it speaks volumes, and maybe just open it up for any further questions. We\u2019re very, very pleased that we now have the opportunity to engage in this conversation. As Dr. Navarro said, it\u2019s been a process that\u2019s taken some time to put together thoughtfully, and we want to be able to talk about it with all of you. So thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> All right, thank you. With that, we\u2019ll turn to our questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do wish to ask a question, please press *1. Our first question is going to come from the line of Matthew Lee from the Associated Press. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi there. Good morning. I just \u2013 I have two brief ones. Number one: What exactly is changing about \u2013 how is it now or going to be easier for allies and partners to buy these drone systems and the other things?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd secondly: Didn\u2019t \u2013 you refer, Dr. Navarro, to the myopic policy of the previous administration. Didn\u2019t this begin, this review with an eye toward easing these restrictions, begin during the previous administration? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Okay, well, I\u2019ll start, and then if Dr. Navarro wants to chime in, he\u2019s welcome to. What I would say is as follows: Let\u2019s remember, again, first of all, there\u2019s the discussion of sort of the wider array of things that fall under the conventional arms treaty \u2013 Conventional Arms Transfer initiative. That is a wider set of things than simply just the UAS policy; we should bear that in mind. And in that instance, or with that regard, what we are explicitly doing there is inserting a definition of economic security, right \u2013 consideration, I should say, of economic security into our broader national security considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in other words, it\u2019s not that we are necessarily doing one thing. You\u2019re doing a number of things, and I hope that we will be able to talk interactively with industry associations \u2013 that\u2019s part of this effort \u2013 to hear what they have to say about how we can more strategically address some of their concerns and enable them to make sales overseas. That will be done within the very near future. In fact, we\u2019re \u2013 as part of the explicit element here, you\u2019ll see some of this when it comes out in the new NSPM so-called. But at any rate, we will be talking to them within the next 60 days so we can put together a specific work plan to actually implement all of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut \u2013 so in other words, it is efforts to do things a little more strategically. We need to do, as the U.S. Government, a better job of strategic advocacy for some of our companies. We need to think about those areas where we can really enable sales overseas. We need to think about how might they sell things that are a little bit harder to sell. We recognize that because the quality of our product is so high, sometimes, for example, it\u2019s more expensive than others. Well, just because of that, we don\u2019t want to disadvantage them. We\u2019d like to find ways to help enable countries to buy our product even when it may be slightly more expensive and so forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we need to be working with our companies to find the ways for strategic advocacy to do all of these things that will enable them, and we are specifically looking, again, as Dr. Navarro said, at the question of how do we enable these companies, how do we provide economic security for the United States, how do we make sure we\u2019re creating American jobs and American prosperity as part of the larger picture, the balance and responsible policy that we have with regard to all the things we consider when we look at any particular arms sale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I\u2019m going to leave it there and then Dr. Navarro, if you want to chime in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Again, the fact of the matter here is, although the U.S. leads the way in UAS technology, overly restrictive policies enacted by the previous administration have accelerated an undesirable outcome. Strategic competitors like China are aggressively marketing to and making sales in international markets that are forecast to be worth more than $50 billion a year within the next decade. Already, we are seeing Chinese replicas of American UAS technology deployed on the runways in the Middle East. In June, at the Paris Air Show, China\u2019s Chengdu Aircraft Group featured its Wing Loong II medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS, a clear knockoff of General Atomics Reaper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBottom line, the policies of the previous administration enabled that, and this administration, consistent with its national security strategy and national defense strategy, is changing that policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Let me \u2013 sorry, just let me add one more thing specific to the UAS policy itself because I mentioned that\u2019s it\u2019s a part of, but it\u2019s an important part of the overall changes under the new CAT policy. We are enabling not just some additional sales of MTCR Category 1; we are actually looking at allowing these companies \u2013 Dr. Navarro mentioned we\u2019re allowing them to go forward and make a function of what we call direct commercial sales \u2013 in other words, to directly make sales to the countries rather than via the U.S. Government. That\u2019s a major change. And we will give them additional space for marketing of these systems and for the eventual sale, assuming that they meet all the other criteria, the sale meets all the other criteria that we would normally consider.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are other things the new policy will do. It\u2019ll eliminate the special scrutiny of laser designators on UAS. That\u2019s one of the things that has hampered the sale of these particular systems. So there\u2019s a number of things within the policy itself that will help enable and widen the space, if you want to call it that, for the sales.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you very much. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question, then, comes from the line of Aaron Mehta from Defense News. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this, guys. A couple of things just to make it clear: So is there any change in the presumption of denial and \u2013 with the unmanned systems? And if so, how is it actually \u2013 if there\u2019s no change, how is it actually different from what the Obama administration set up in 2015 with that standard? And then can you just go into why the laser designator decision was made and what that actually means in terms of being able to sell these things to different countries?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Let me be clear, first of all, that the presumption of denial is not a feature of a particular administration. The presumption of denial comes as a feature of the MTCR regime itself. And the rationale behind it is one that I think is understandable and it still pertains, and that is it is supposed to prevent the proliferation of systems that may indeed cause \u2013 of weapons of mass destruction, in essence, and those systems in particular that might, for example, endanger U.S. troops.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we have to have those considerations in mind and that\u2019s why I say this is a balance policy. It does not change the presumption of denial under the MTCR, okay? It\u2019s \u2013 again, this is a regime that is a multilateral regime and it\u2019s existed for some time. The point is that what we are looking to do is take that presumption of denial, assess it against other factors \u2013 and these are important factors, the ones that I mentioned before, and there will be others \u2013 but the point is that we will work to update the MCTR. That\u2019s another issue. We are looking to ensure that the MTCR keeps pace with the dynamic quality of all of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s remember that the things that, for example, two or three years ago may have been, again, endangering our troops may have been of concern to us with regard to the spread of weapons of mass destruction, now may have commercial applications. There may be things that, again, over time, do not concern us in quite the same way. So we are looking together with our partners to update the MTCR. That\u2019s an ongoing process. But the existing presumption of denial \u2013 that doesn\u2019t change. What we are doing is \u2013 again, we are widening the space for the companies to do their sales and marketing via direct commercial sales. We\u2019re eliminating some of the specific factors that in the past we looked at when we approved these sales or we didn\u2019t. And what we are doing is ensuring that, again, that the MTCR itself keeps pace with the changes over time that we think are salient and need to be considered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roxana Tiron from Bloomberg. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. Hi. Thank you for doing this. Two questions, actually: Is there \u2013 are there any considerations given to make sure that some of these arm sales don\u2019t end up to countries that violate human rights? And also, President Trump yesterday said that this could allow sales of weapons to go through in just days, but Congress still has about 30 days to block a proposed sale. Does that change? Is there any change in that as well?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Okay. So let me be very clear. Nothing in the \u2013 this new NSPM that will be issued changes either the existing legal or the regulatory requirements. And we are very respectful of Congress\u2019s role in all of this. Again, we consider them to be our partners and they are the ones that ultimately will authorize a number of these sales, in so far as \u2013 again, we have good consultation with them. There is a process by which all this flows. I won\u2019t get into all the mechanics of that here. I\u2019m happy offline to talk about it, or we can give you a lot more detail on how that all works. But the point is Congress retains its role. Again, no change to the legal or regulatory framework.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the important thing again here to remember \u2013 you asked about human rights. The real question for us \u2013 again, this is a balanced policy. We absolutely look at human rights as one of a set of considerations that we look at. It\u2019s all done \u2013 every sale we do is done on a case-by-case basis. In other words, we look at a whole range of U.S. national security objectives. Dr. Navarro talked about some of them. We are looking, again, at the \u2013 we are looking at the \u2013 again, the entire range. And let\u2019s remember, U.S. national security make \u2013 is comprised \u2013 may be comprised of a whole set of things. We look at democracy, at governance, at human rights, at economic development, at security, at the creation of U.S. national \u2013 or U.S. jobs and American prosperity. We look at all those things, with an emphasis on making sure that, again, companies can operate in that space, that they have every opportunity to do their business within that set of considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn human rights specifically, let me just mention we have been very, very focused, especially in this administration and in tandem with Congress, on trying to give our partners, our strategic partners overseas, the ability to avoid civilian causalities especially where we can. I know that\u2019s the focus of \u2013 in Congress and the wider array of public opinion. This is really important. We need to give them an understanding \u2013 using some of our experience, give them an understanding of how to minimize civilian causalities to the extent possible when they are doing their operations overseas. That\u2019s critically important to us. I really want to emphasize that, because, again, we have focused on it so very hard over the last little while, especially with Congress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Yeah. Let me echo what Ambassador Kaidanow said, because it\u2019s so important. The new policy clearly and strongly recognizes the need for responsible balance. And just some of the key issues include human rights, nonproliferation, as well as safeguards against the transfer of our technology, the theft of that, to bad actors. And the safeguards that are put in place include things like prescreening, principles of proper use, training and support, and a continuation of stringent end-use monitoring. So this is a key part of President Trump\u2019s new policies. And again, as Ambassador Kaidanow said, they require enhanced end-use monitoring, directing the federal government to work with partners in reducing civilian causalities in conflict, and championing principles of human rights and international law, including the law of armed conflict. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Let me \u2013 sorry, just to add one thing, and again, to emphasize \u2013 this is so salient and Dr. Navarro just mentioned it again, but this is the first time that minimizing civilian casualties indeed will be an affirmative part of our conventional arms policy. So that really is a change, and it\u2019s an important change, and is one that I think we\u2019re incredibly focused on as we do our work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Stone from Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks for doing this. What is the number of jobs that will be created by this? And what is the estimated dollar amount that defense exports will go up, making them go from X to Y?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Dr. Navarro?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> So we\u2019re going to say at the general 30,000-foot level. This will all be a function of how the sales go forward and through the review process. So that would merely be speculation at this point. What we do know is that this will provide the American industry with expanded opportunities, and that\u2019s the signature of President Trump\u2019s administration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Your next question\u2019s coming from the line of Charles Forrester from Jane\u2019s. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Good afternoon, or morning rather. Thank you very much for doing this. Question for you is regarding offset technology transfer. Now some of the markets that you\u2019ve mentioned here, in the Middle East and India for example, very strong on technology transfer and getting some of that work done out there as part of a package deal. How do you see that reconciling with the new policy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Well, what I would say is with regard to \u2013 first of all, I think you know that in certain particular instances, we are \u2013 we allow the companies to do the actual negotiations with regard to offsets and other requirements and so forth. The U.S. Government itself doesn\u2019t get in the middle of that set of negotiations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut again, let\u2019s remember that what the NSPM will call for is within 60 days we are apt to produce a work plan. And that work plan, again, will be done and created in conjunction with a number of these companies and with some of the industry associations. In putting it together, we will be looking at a whole array of things, not just coproduction but, again, things that will enable sales overseas: strategic efforts to create an environment in which our companies can push back against foreign competitors, make our products as competitive as possible, advance sales, all those things that we want to be doing. Financing advocacy \u2013 in other words, looking at ways that we might, again, if our product ends up being slightly more expensive because it is better, then how do we enable countries to really do that so that they can purchase those systems. So there\u2019s a whole array of things that may come. We\u2019re going to have that conversation with companies, but it\u2019s important that we look at that whole array of things in order to give us a better understanding of where we can be most effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our last --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO: </strong>I would just add to that the organizational culture of the Trump administration is: buy American, hire American. These are the two simple rules that President Trump has repeatedly stressed, and be assured that this administration will be encouraging private defense industry to embrace those principles as it goes forward with its expanded opportunities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Okay. We\u2019ll take our last question now, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Then our final question will come from Aaron Mehta from Defense News. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi, you guys. Sorry. I just wanted to follow up on the laser designation question from earlier. What is actually being changed about that? Why does that change matter? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>So basically what it means is that we\u2019ll be reducing the complications to how we classify UAS. Because under the previous policy, UAS equipped with so-called strike-enabling technology, like laser target designators, were classified under a specific, discrete category. And the criteria for transferring that category of UAS was equivalent to the criteria for transferring an armed UAS. So we placed the proposed transfer of UASs equipped with strike-enabling technologies under significant scrutiny in the past, and we limited their transfer to occur only through the Foreign Military Sale system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat approach caused a lot of confusion within industry and our partners, so the new policy does away with this category of quote-un-quote striking-enabling, and those technologies that were previously classified as such are now treated as unarmed, essentially. So eliminating that kind of distinction makes it easier, or makes it so that U.S. industry faces fewer barriers and less confusion when they\u2019re attempting to compete against other countries in marketing and selling those similar systems to our partners. So what it does is it allows them effectively to sell you UAS with laser target designators via direct commercial sale, which, as I mentioned previously, can potentially allow for faster procurement by those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>And before we close, I just want to offer Mr. Kausner from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency an opportunity to comment on any of the topics raised, if he has any comments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR KAUSNER: </strong>Nothing to add. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>All right. Terrific. Well with that then, we\u2019ll conclude the call. I remind everyone that the contents of the call is on the record, but embargoed until the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy is posted on the White House website. That link was provided in the advisory sent out for this call, and we expect that will be around 12:00 p.m. noon today, Thursday April 19th. Thank you everyone, and have an enjoyable day.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n<p>\n\tWell, good morning. And I really, really appreciate this opportunity to swing down to Stanford while I was out on the West Coast and particularly to address this group. And I want to thank Stanford and the Hoover Institution and the international studies group for allowing me to speak to you this morning. I have familiarity with the Hoover Institution; I\u2019ve spoken at some of their events in the past in my prior life, and it has consistently produced great, principled scholarship that makes the calls for representative government, private enterprise, and protecting the American way of life right at the center of your activities, and very important topics that we spend our time on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in that regard, you certainly have a true advocate in your ranks: my friend, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who \u2013 I don\u2019t know if she takes responsibility for this situation she got me into or not, but I \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I hold her partially accountable anyway. And \u2013 but I appreciate Condi\u2019s advice and counsel. When you arrive at the Secretary of State\u2019s desk, I was looking for the how-to manual; there wasn\u2019t one there. So she\u2019s been a great source of help and inspiration to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I also want to acknowledge the other co-host, one of our nation\u2019s most dedicated and gifted public servants, certainly of the 20th century: former Secretary George Shultz. And George and I have known each other a long time as well, and I\u2019m a great admirer of his work as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ve just come from a ministerial meeting in Vancouver, in which a number of nations discussed how to better implement our maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. The United States and our allies are and continue to be united in continuing this campaign until North Korea takes meaningful steps toward denuclearization. We all agreed \u2013 all of us \u2013 that we will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom Vancouver I made a quick swing down here to California. And I appreciated Dr. Rice\u2019s help in arranging this for me on somewhat short notice. There are some people back in Washington that are suspicious I\u2019m escaping the bad weather today to just come down here, but I am delighted to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe topic and the subject of my remarks today is to talk with you about the way forward for the United States in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m going to start by giving you a kind of a broad historical and political context for what are some very difficult situations facing the Syrian people, and they raise concerns for all of the international powers as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen I want to describe why it is crucial to our national defense to maintain a military and diplomatic presence in Syria, to help bring an end to that conflict, and assist the Syrian people as they chart a course to achieve a new political future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then lastly, I want to detail the steps this administration is taking to achieve a stable, unified, and independent Syria, free of terrorist threats and free of weapons of mass destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen, as indicated, Dr. Rice and I will have a little conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor nearly 50 years, the Syrian people have suffered under the dictatorship of Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar al-Assad. The nature of the Assad regime, like that of its sponsor Iran, is malignant. It has promoted state terror. It has empowered groups that kill American soldiers, such as al-Qaida. It has backed Hizballah and Hamas. And it has violently suppressed political opposition. Bashar al-Assad\u2019s grand strategy, to the extent he has one beyond his own survival, includes hosting some of the most radical terrorist elements in the region and using them to destabilize his neighbors. Assad\u2019s regime is corrupt, and his methods of governance and economic development have increasingly excluded certain ethnic and religious groups. His human rights record is notorious the world over.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSuch oppression cannot persist forever. And over the years, latent anger built up within the country, and many Syrians rose up and opposed Assad\u2019s rule. Within the days of what began as peaceful demonstrations that swept Syria in 2011, Assad and his regime responded to his own people with bullets and jail sentences.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSince that time, the story of Syria has been one of a humanitarian catastrophe. Up to half a million Syrians have died. Over 5.4 million Syrians are refugees, and 6.1 million are internally displaced persons, or IDPs. And as a result of conflict between regime and opposition forces, whole cities have been destroyed. It will take years to rebuild an entire nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPrevious American efforts to halt the conflict have been ineffective. When Assad used chemical weapons on his own people in 2013, in defiance of an American red line threat to retaliate, U.S. inaction emboldened the regime to further disregard civilian lives. In April of last year, the Trump administration responded to Assad\u2019s use of sarin nerve agent on civilians with cruise missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of Assad\u2019s air force. We did this to degrade the Syrian military\u2019s ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks, to protect innocent civilians, and to dissuade the Syrian regime from further use or proliferation of chemical weapons. The United States takes chemical weapons threats seriously, and we cannot stand idly by and allow their use to become regularized. We will continue to seek accountability and justice for the victims of that attack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2012, the Assad regime military forces began to struggle badly against armed opposition. The regime was soon bolstered through the assistance of Iranian-backed fighting forces. But despite this help, by August of 2015, Syrian rebel forces had made substantial progress against Assad\u2019s regime. Fearing for his own survival, Assad then appealed to Russia, his longtime ally, for help. Russia intervened to save the regime, largely by providing increased air power, intelligence, and arms support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn December of 2016, the key city of Aleppo fell to the regime after a brutal campaign that essentially destroyed that city, which had a population over two million people before the war. This symbolized the regime\u2019s ruthless determination to regain momentum in the conflict. It also led to \u2013 Assad to wrongly think that he would maintain power without addressing the Syrian regime\u2019s \u2013 the Syrian people\u2019s legitimate grievances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe civil war in Syria was horrific in and of itself. But Syria was thrown into an even greater state of turmoil with the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. This was an aspiring terror-state inside the borders of Iraq and Syria. The conflict between the regime and various opposition groups fighting to change Assad\u2019s grip on power created the conditions for the rapid expansion of ISIS in 2013 and 2014. ISIS originally emerged from the ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq, a group Assad had covertly backed. Evidence suggests Assad also abetted ISIS by releasing known terrorists from Syrian prisons and turning a blind eye to ISIS\u2019s growth. ISIS exploited the instability and lack of centralized authority in Syria to set up what it falsely claimed was a \u201ccaliphate,\u201d with the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital. Eventually, ISIS expanded to possess at its height a territory \u2013 an amount of territory roughly equivalent to the size of the United Kingdom, and a significant fighting force. Flush with cash from looted banks and in control of oil fields in Syria and Iraq, ISIS had all the elements to sustain itself and carry out attacks on the U.S. homeland and those of our allies. The establishment of a radical terror-state attracted thousands of jihadists from over 100 countries, and motivated other terrorists around the world to commit attacks where they live.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the wake of the rise of ISIS, millions fled their homes, villages, and cities to escape the brutal regime\u2019s ethnic cleansing, resulting in massive refugee flows into the neighboring countries and as far as Europe and Scandinavia. By the middle of 2014, ISIS had a stable base of operations in Syria and significant revenue streams to fund, plan, inspire, and direct attacks against targets in the West and against our regional allies. It was using Syria to build chemical weapons for use against our partners. Recognizing the destructive power of a strengthening terrorist organization, America focused on a military defeat of ISIS. In spite of the threat ISIS posed in Syria, Assad focused instead on fighting the Syrian opposition, even with Iranian and Russian military support at his back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Trump administration\u2019s counterterrorism policy is quite simple. It is to protect Americans at home and abroad from attacks by terrorists. Central to this policy is to deny terrorist and terrorist organizations the opportunity to organize, raise money, recruit fighters, train, plan, and execute attacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen he took office, President Trump took decisive action to accelerate the gains that were being made in Syria and Iraq. He directed Secretary of Defense Mattis to present within 30 days a new plan for defeating ISIS. The President quickly approved that plan. He directed a pace of operations that would achieve decisive results quickly, delegating greater authority to American commanders in the field, and he gave our military leaders more freedom to determine and apply the tactics that would best lead to ISIS\u2019s defeat. Today, nearly all territory in Iraq and Syria once controlled by ISIS, or approximately 98 percent of all of that once United Kingdom-sized territory, has been liberated, and ISIS has not been able to regain one foot of that ground. ISIS\u2019s physical \u201ccaliphate\u201d of Raqqa is destroyed. The liberated capital of the caliphate no longer serves as a magnet for those hoping to build a terrorist empire. Approximately 3.2 million Syrians and 4.5 million Iraqis have been freed from the tyranny of ISIS. Over 3 million internally displaced Iraqis are now back home, and Mosul, the caliphate\u2019s second capital city in Iraq and one of Iraq\u2019s largest cities, is completely clear of ISIS. In Iraq, for the first time since the beginning of the crisis in December of 2013, there are more Iraqis going home than there are that are still displaced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we survey Syria today, we see the big picture, a situation characterized by principally three factors:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tISIS is substantially, but not completely defeated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime controls about half of Syria\u2019s territory and its population.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd continued strategic threats to the U.S. from not just ISIS and al-Qaida, but from others persist. And this threat I\u2019m referring to is principally Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of its strategy to create a northern arch, stretching from Iran to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, Iran has dramatically strengthened its presence in Syria by deploying Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops; supporting Lebanese Hizballah; and importing proxy forces from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere. Through its position in Syria, Iran is positioning to continue attacking U.S. interests, our allies, and personnel in the region. It is spending billions of dollars a year to prop up Assad and wage proxy wars at the expense of supporting its own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, the unresolved plight of millions of Syrian refugees and IDPs remains a humanitarian crisis. The catastrophic state of affairs is directly related to the continued lack of security and legitimate governance in Syria itself. Assad has gassed his own people, he has barrel bombed entire villages and urban neighborhoods, and repeatedly undermined any chance for a peaceful resolution of political differences. Those abuses continue to this day, as seen in recent civilian casualties in East Ghouta and Idlib Governance<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_ftn1\" href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>. There is no way to effectively facilitate a large-scale safe and voluntary return of refugees without a political solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn short, Syria remains a source of severe strategic threats, and a major challenge for our diplomacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the United States will continue to remain engaged as a means to protect our own national security interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States desires five key end states for Syria:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, ISIS and al-Qaida in Syria suffer an enduring defeat, do not present a threat to the homeland, and do not resurface in a new form; that Syria never again serves as a platform or safe haven for terrorists to organize, recruit, finance, train and carry out attacks on American citizens at home or abroad or against our allies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, the underlying conflict between the Syrian people and the Assad regime is resolved through a UN-led political process prescribed in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and a stable, unified, independent Syria, under post-Assad leadership, is functioning as a state.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iranian influence in Syria is diminished, their dreams of a northern arch are denied, and Syria\u2019s neighbors are secure from all threats emanating from Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFourth, conditions are created so that the refugees and IDPs can begin to safely and voluntarily return to Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd fifth, Syria is free of weapons of mass destruction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Trump administration is implementing a new strategy to achieve these end states. This process largely entails increased diplomatic action on the heels of our ongoing military successes. Our diplomatic efforts will be characterized by stabilization initiatives and a new emphasis on the political solution to the Syrian conflict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut let us be clear: The United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge. Our military mission in Syria will remain conditions-based. We cannot make the same mistakes that were made in 2011 when a premature departure from Iraq allowed al-Qaida in Iraq to survive and eventually morph into ISIS. It was that vacuum that allowed ISIS and other terrorist organizations to wreak havoc on the country. And it gave ISIS a safe haven to plan attacks against Americans and our allies. We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria. ISIS presently has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe understand that some Americans are skeptical of continued involvement in Syria and question the benefits of maintaining a presence in such a troubled country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHowever, it is vital for the United States to remain engaged in Syria for several reasons: Ungoverned spaces, especially in conflict zones, are breeding grounds for ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The fight against ISIS is not over. There are bands of ISIS fighters who are already beginning to wage an insurgency. We and our allies will hunt them down and kill them or capture them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, we must persist in Syria to thwart al-Qaida, which still has a substantial presence and base of operations in northwest Syria. As in the years before 9/11, al-Qaida is eager to create a sanctuary to plan and launch attacks on the West. Although ISIS is the terrorist group that has dominated the headlines most in the last few years, al-Qaida is still a grave threat and is looking to reconstitute in new and powerful ways.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, a total withdrawal of American personnel at this time would restore Assad and continue his brutal treatment against his own people. A murderer of his own people cannot generate the trust required for long-term stability. A stable, unified, and independent Syria ultimately requires post-Assad leadership in order to be successful. Continued U.S. presence to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS will also help pave the way for legitimate local civil authorities to exercise responsible governance of their liberated areas. The departure of Assad through the UN-led Geneva process will create the conditions for a durable peace within Syria and security along the borders for Syria\u2019s neighbors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tU.S. disengagement from Syria would provide Iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in Syria. As we have seen from Iran\u2019s proxy wars and public announcements, Iran seeks dominance in the Middle East and the destruction of our ally, Israel. As a destabilized nation and one bordering Israel, Syria presents an opportunity that Iran is all too eager to exploit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, consistent with our values, America has the opportunity to help a people which has suffered greatly. We must give Syrians a chance to return home and rebuild their lives. The safe and voluntary return of Syrian refugees serves the security interests of the United States, our allies, and our partners. To relieve the enormous pressure of refugee flows on the surrounding region and on Europe, conditions must be created for these refugees to safely and voluntarily return home. It will be impossible to ensure stability on one end of the Mediterranean, in Europe, if chaos and injustice prevail on the other end, in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, along with its allies and partners, will undertake the following steps to bring stability and peace to Syria:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, stabilization initiatives in liberated areas are essential to making sure that life can return to normal and ISIS does not re-emerge. Stabilization initiatives consist of essential measures such as clearing unexploded land mines left behind by ISIS, allowing hospitals to reopen, restoring water and electricity services, and getting boys and girls back in school. The approach has proved successful in Iraq, where millions of Iraqis have returned to their homes. In Syria, however, unlike in Iraq, we do not have a national government partner for stabilization efforts, so we must work with others. As such, there is a great deal of difficulty to them. Since May, the United States has deployed additional diplomats to the affected areas in Syria, working with the United Nations, our partners in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and various nongovernmental organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur work to help local and regional authorities provide services to liberated areas builds trust between local populations and local leaders who are returning. Terrorists thrive under conditions that allow them to peddle their warped and hateful messages to vulnerable people in conflict-stricken areas. Our stabilization efforts will help those people turn away from the prospect of terrorism and toward integration in their local communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe must be clear: \u201cStabilization\u201d is not a synonym for open-ended nation-building or a synonym for reconstruction. But it is essential. No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone. Our military presence is backed by State Department and USAID teams who are already working with local authorities to help liberated peoples stabilize their own communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimultaneous with stabilization efforts, de-escalating the overall conflict is also a critical step to creating the conditions for a post-Assad political settlement. Since July, the United States has worked with Russia and Jordan to establish the de-escalation area in the southwest part of Syria. It has achieved a ceasefire, ended indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations, and with some few exceptions, has thus far held up well. The agreement in the southwest also addresses Israel\u2019s security by requiring Iranian-backed militias, most notably Hizballah, to move away from Israel\u2019s border. We need Russia to continue to work with the United States and Jordan to enforce this de-escalation area. If it does, the resulting cessation of regime-opposition hostilities will allow for the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, create the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees, and provide the Syrian people the security to start rebuilding areas scarred by conflict. Our efforts have been \u2013 have helped refugees and IDPs return into the southwest de-escalation areas from where they had taken refuge in Jordan, and overall, an estimated 715,000 Syrians in total, including 50,000 Syrians from abroad, returned to their homes in 2017. These early but positive trends can increase through the continuation of de-escalation efforts not just in the southwest, but elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn counterterrorism, we will continue to work with allies and partners, such as Turkey, to address the terror threat in Idlib and address Turkey\u2019s concern with PKK terrorists elsewhere. Al-Qaida is attempting to re-establish a base of operation for itself in Idlib. We are actively developing the best option to neutralize this threat in conjunction with allies and partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is vigorously supporting UN efforts to achieve the political solution under UN Security Council Resolution 2254. This is the political framework for peace and stability in a unified Syria which has already been agreed upon by members of the UN Security Council. Specifically, we will work through what is known as the Geneva process, supporting UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Assad regime clearly looks to Russia as a guarantor of its security. Russia therefore has a meaningful role to play in persuading the Assad regime to engage constructively in the Geneva process. Beyond Russia\u2019s own vote to support UNSCR 2254, President Putin reaffirmed Russia\u2019s commitment to Geneva in his joint statement with President Trump issued from<span> Da Nang, Vietnam </span>last November. The United States and Russia have worked together on the southwest de-escalation area to success, and we have established deconfliction arrangements around the Euphrates River Valley to ensure the safety of our respective forces.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRussia must now follow through on the commitment our presidents made last November to find an ultimate solution through the UN-led Geneva process. One of the ways Russia can do that is to exert its unique leverage on the Syrian regime, which itself has agreed to participate in the Geneva process. Russia must put new levels of pressure on the regime to not just show up in Geneva but to credibly engage with the UN\u2019s efforts and implement agreed outcomes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, the EU, and regional partners will not provide international reconstruction assistance to any area under control of the Assad regime. We ask all stakeholders in Syria\u2019s future to do the same. We will discourage economic relationships between the Assad regime and any other country. Instead, we will encourage international assistance to rebuild areas the global coalition and its local partners have liberated from ISIS. Once Assad is gone from power, the United States will gladly encourage the normalization of economic relationships between Syria and other nations. The United States calls on all nations to exercise discipline in economically pressuring Assad and rebuilding Syria after a political transition. Our expectation is that the desire for a return to normal life and these tools of pressure will help rally the Syrian people and individuals within the regime to compel Assad to step aside.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUNSCR 2254 also calls for UN-supervised free elections in Syria. The United States believes that free and transparent elections, to include the participation of the Syrian diaspora who have been displaced \u2013 all those who were forced to flee the conflict \u2013 will result in the permanent departure of Assad and his family from power. This process will take time, and we urge patience in the departure of Assad and the establishment of new leadership. Responsible change may not come as immediate as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform, UN-supervised elections \u2013 but that change will come.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States recognizes and honors the great sacrifices the Syrian Democratic Forces have made in liberating Syrians from ISIS, but its victories on the battlefield do not solve the challenge of local governance and representation for people of eastern and northern Syria. Interim local political arrangements that give voice to all groups and ethnicities supportive of Syria\u2019s broader political transition must emerge with international support. Any interim arrangements must be truly representative and must not threaten any of Syria\u2019s neighboring states. Similarly, the voices of Syrians from these regions must be heard in Geneva and in the broader discussion about Syria\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn these points, the United States hears and takes seriously the concerns of our NATO ally Turkey. We recognize the humanitarian contributions and military sacrifices Turkey has made towards defeating ISIS, towards their support of millions of Syrian refugees, and stabilizing areas of Syria it has helped liberate. We must have Turkey\u2019s close cooperation in achieving a new future for Syria that ensures security for Syria\u2019s neighbors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, reducing and expelling malicious Iranian influence from Syria depends on a democratic Syria. For many years, Syria under Bashar al-Assad has been a client state of Iran. A Syrian central government that is not under the control of Assad will have new legitimacy to assert its authority over the country. The reassertion of national sovereignty by a new government, along with de-escalation efforts and new flows of international aid, will lower violence, set better conditions for stability, and speed up the departure of foreign fighters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize Syria presents many complexities. Our proposed solutions will not be easy to achieve. But it is necessary to proceed in these ways for the sake of our security and that of our allies. We will not repeat mistakes of the past in Iraq, nor will we repeat the mistakes made in Libya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell-intentioned military interventions independent of stabilization and political strategies give rise to a host of adverse, unintended consequences. For this reason, we seek to de-escalate the civil war in Syria, work for peace, and encourage all parties to head to the negotiating table. Continued fighting will likely lead to worsened humanitarian conditions, more chaos, and increased regional military intervention in Syria. Our focus is to build a positive political path forward that honors the will of the Syrian people and sustains the unity and territorial integrity of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs with almost all of our foreign policy challenges, the steps for achieving our objectives cannot be undertaken alone. We will continue to work closely with allies and partners. In suffering many terrorist attacks over the past few years, our allies in Europe have sadly experienced firsthand what groups like ISIS and al-Qaida are capable of. We need allies and partners to support our strategy in order to permanently mitigate the risk to security posed by these terrorist organizations and others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, the Syrian people have endured seven years of unimaginable chaos and hardship. They need help. A new course of action is a preferable alternative to more years of wishful thinking. A stable, unified, independent Syria will serve the national security interests of the United States, its allies, and our partners. If that reality can come to pass, it will be a victory for all, and it will support the ability of the Syrian people to pursue their own God-given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for your kind attention, and I look forward to our discussion.

Thank you very much for that comprehensive look at one of the most daunting problems that, I think, anyone in the international system has faced, and I\u2019d like to return to a couple of substantive issues, but I want to ask you a question first about being Secretary of State. It\u2019s kind of a hard job, isn\u2019t it? (Laughter.)\n\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>It\u2019s \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s a little different. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> Yeah. (Laughter). So, when I was secretary, I\u2019d get up in the morning, and there were some things I\u2019d see on my calendar, and I\u2019d think, \u201cOh good, I\u2019m going to get to do that,\u201d and then there were some things that I\u2019d would think, \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll just go back to bed.\u201d What do you like about the job, and what do you find most challenging?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, what I like most about the job is what I\u2019ve always enjoyed throughout my career, and it\u2019s the quality of the people you have the privilege to work with every day. And what I\u2019ll say about the people in the State Department, the career people as well as the political appointees: These are extraordinarily dedicated individuals, some of the greatest patriots you\u2019ll meet anywhere, and they really come in every day with one objective in mind, and that\u2019s to carry out the foreign policy goals, objectives of the administration, but to serve the interests of the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what I look forward to every day is even if we\u2019re talking about really complicated issues, like the one I just described \u2013 and Syria is one of the most complex situations on the ground \u2013 the level of intelligence and the level of openness for us to have a good conversation about that is what I most look forward to. And I have a bullpen area \u2013 it used to be the Deputy Secretary of Management\u2019s office. I absconded it, and we have nothing but whiteboards in there, and I love going in the bullpen and just whiteboarding these exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat I least look forward to coming in to are those days when I have to deal with the loss of life. And whether it\u2019s the loss of a State Department person, or the loss of military personnel, or any American citizen anywhere, those are the days that are difficult, because you make calls to family members, you try to \u2013 people who have been taken hostage, you try to give their families reassurance, but those are the days that are really tough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Yeah. Now, as Secretary, you face some unique challenges as well. Social media was barely born when I was secretary. Thank God for that. And we know that your boss loves social media, so what\u2019s it like, and how do you deal with the constant pressure of social media, especially out of the White House?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, he\u2019s world class at social media and I\u2019m not \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and I want to confess here in the heart of the creation of this great technology, I have no social media accounts. I have never had any and I don\u2019t intend to have any. (Laughter.) It is a great tool when it\u2019s used well. The President has used it to great effect by bypassing the traditional means of communicating, and he absolutely thrives on this ability to instantly communicate not just to the American people, but to our friends and allies or to our adversaries, to the entire world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to do that because he \u2013 that is just the way the President operates. So the challenge is just getting caught up because I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t even have a Twitter account that I can follow what he\u2019s tweeting, so my staff usually has to print his tweets out and hand them to me. (Laughter.) Now, on the one hand, you can say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s nuts. Why don\u2019t you get an account?\u201d But on the other hand, I\u2019ve actually concluded that\u2019s not a bad system because it goes out and I don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to go out, so there\u2019s not a whole lot I\u2019m going to do until it\u2019s out there. By the time I find out about it, there\u2019s actually been some period of time, and dependent on where I am in the world it might be five minutes or it might be an hour before somebody hands me a piece of paper and says, \u201cHey, the President just tweeted this out.\u201d There \u2013 I already have the early reactions to that and it allows me to now begin to think about, all right, how do we take that then into \u2013 if it\u2019s a foreign policy issue, is it \u2013 what is it he\u2019s tweeting about, how do we take that and now use it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\u2019s interesting. I get the question a lot from people about, gosh, it must be impossible to deal with that. I had to get used to it early on because it was very unconventional for all of us. But I take it and I say, okay, this is information. Let\u2019s \u2013 we know what our objectives are and he didn\u2019t change any of them. This is just his way of wanting to communicate on the subject. How do we take that and use it? And so that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s how I deal with it, but I think I\u2019m probably going to go to my grave and never have a social media account. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> I was really struck when you talked about Syria and you talked about the way forward in Syria, leaving aside the military side, which obviously there have been some real gains, particularly in clearing ISIS from Iraq and now a leg up, at least, on ISIS in Syria. But I was struck that when you turned to political stabilization, you used a few words that most people would not associate with the Trump administration. I want to have you talk a little bit about that. You talked about values, America\u2019s values. You talked about human rights. You talked about the need for the Syrian people to be able to express themselves in free elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe would consider those parts of the values agenda, if you will, because going really all the way back to Woodrow Wilson, American presidents have believed that the internal composition of states actually does matter. And I think you\u2019ve made a very good case that one of the reasons that we face the problem that we face in Syria is that Bashar al-Assad is a dictator who has murdered his own people and oppressed his own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so pull back from Syria and talk about how, after now almost a year on the job, you see the issue of values, human rights, democracy in the \u2013 in American foreign policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve \u2013 as an engineer, I guess I\u2019ve had a hard time describing to others how I view it. Our American values of freedom, respect for the individual, human dignity \u2013 all of the manifestations of the values that define who we are as a people, who we are collectively as a group of people who have aligned ourselves around these values and defines how we treat one another every day \u2013 how you take that into the foreign policy arena.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd at one level, these are values that are enduring, and what I\u2019ve said to people is you know with foreign policy if you \u2013 when you take the values and you try to put them into foreign policy, the concern I\u2019ve always had is policies can change and adjust, and they do. And so how do you \u2013 if you\u2019re doing that, your values never change. They never adjust. So our values are with us at all interactions always.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, how do you operationalize \u2013 and I\u2019ll use that word \u2013 how do you operationalize the values? Because I think that\u2019s getting to the heart of the question. And Syria is a great case study in my opinion of that. Going into Syria and advocating human rights, religious freedoms, women\u2019s equal participation in the midst of literally thousands of people and civilians being killed every day doesn\u2019t resonate very well, because the most important human right to anybody is our first one: the right to life. Life, then liberty, then the pursuit of happiness. And that\u2019s the way I think about our values. I first have to keep people from being killed, and if I can keep them from being killed and if we can create areas of stability, then we begin to create the seeds of liberty, and then we create the pathway to a pursuit of happiness. And underneath all of that are, then, the articulation of our respect for the human dignity, the human condition, all the ways that we express these values that are uniquely American values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it really is how do you create the conditions so people can actually achieve that, and the priority in Syria right now is stop people from being killed. They\u2019re being killed. They\u2019re being killed by the thousands. Stop that, stabilize it, start creating some conditions, and then we can begin to promote respect for people\u2019s religious freedoms, respect for their dignity. And so it is very much \u2013 in my mind it\u2019s \u2013 and being an engineer, this is the way I think it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s a process inside of a system, and at any point in time and depending on the country\u2019s condition, the location, the circumstances, we\u2019re going to be at a different place in that process. If we have a stable \u2013 a stable government that is repressive of certain religious organizations, then we go right at that. Because it\u2019s not that people are being killed, but they\u2019re being persecuted; they\u2019re being denied their own pursuit of happiness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it \u2013 very much, I think in each situation, I look at it and say, what is the priority here? And the first priority is always the protection of life \u2013 stop people from being killed. And if you do that, you begin to create the conditions where we can truly lean forward and advocate on the values themselves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>And the tools for doing the kind of work that you\u2019re talking about, obviously when you\u2019ve stabilized a situation, you still have to have the diplomacy, you still have to have the assistance to people. There have been concerns about the commitment to, say, foreign assistance and to having those tools that American diplomats rely on to bring stability. Jim Mattis apparently famously said that if he doesn\u2019t have foreign assistance, he\u2019s going to need more bullets, just to paraphrase.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, a couple of American foreign assistance efforts that have been just universally appreciated: PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which probably, through the efforts of President Bush and then President Obama, saved millions of people from a pandemic; and then the Millennium Challenge, which tries to take foreign assistance and give it to states that are actually going to use it wisely, that are not corrupt. Can you talk a little bit about the future of those programs? And I know you\u2019re an advocate for them. How are you doing inside the administration and on the Hill?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, you picked two of the easiest to defend, because PEPFAR is broadly viewed, within the administration even, as like the gold standard of success. It has produced extraordinary results and it has demonstrated it really uses the American dollar wisely. For dollar invested, if you think about it as an investment, it\u2019s a dollar invested for the return \u2013 PEPFAR, by any measure you want to examine it, has been wildly successful.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the Millennium Challenge Corporation, similarly, has been wildly successful because of the disciplined process it uses. I think the debate that goes on more is not about those kinds of programs, but about a lot of other assistance programs that may not have the kind of structure around them that PEPFAR has or the kind of structure around them \u2013 and accountability to go with structure \u2013 that the Millennium Challenge has, and a view that America is, has been, and still is today the most generous nation on planet Earth when it comes to humanitarian assistance, disaster relief. We are always first and foremost.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut if you look at the situation with the nation\u2019s finances, and we all know about the deficits that we\u2019re building up all the time, I think the President has rightly asked the question of, okay, we know what we\u2019re doing; how\u2019s the rest of the world doing? And are you doing your share? And so that has become very much an overlay to how this administration thinks about all means of foreign assistance, from the kind of assistance that\u2019s provided through USAID and the State Department to foreign military sales and assistance, to international organizations at the UN and others. We will do our part, but we demand that others do their part as well. And so he has created very high expectations that we will go out and elicit others to step up and start contributing more on a proportionate basis with their ability to do so. And he famously points to a lot of nations around the world that are doing extraordinarily well. In many cases they\u2019re doing better than we are with our own economy, yet they\u2019re not carrying what in our view is their share of this need the world has.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo a lot of this last year and even the early part of this year is a lot of active engagement with countries around this issue. Having said that, there\u2019s no abandonment of our recognition of these needs. And as you know and through the budget process, the budget process involves our two branches of government, co-equal branches. The Congress has their say on it as well, and the administration has theirs. So a lot of this is, in the end, we resolve it through the budget negotiation process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I would say about the State Department budget in particular, because it got a lot of \u2013 it\u2019s gotten a lot of discussion, is I like to give people perspective. The State Department\u2019s budget is coming off of a record high \u2013 $55 billion, largest budget the State Department ever had, and a series of about the last five or six years of one record budget after another. And what I tell people, and having run another organization that had large numbers we had to deal with every day, it\u2019s very hard to execute \u2013 it\u2019s very hard for the State Department to execute a $55 billion budget. I mean, quite frankly, if you want to do it well and you want to be good stewards of the American hard-earned taxpayer dollar that you\u2019ve been given, we do need to be able to go out and do that well. And the truth of the matter is one of the reasons we\u2019re not struggling in 2017 is we had a lot of carry-forward money because no one could execute that size of a budget. And so there\u2019s a lot of money that\u2019s moving through.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo right now I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a dynamic situation where we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position of being unable to meet, we believe, the most critical needs out there. But it\u2019s coming and we\u2019re trying to plan ahead and we\u2019re trying to elicit more burden-sharing from others around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE: </strong>Thanks. One final question before we let you go. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask about where you started your remarks: North Korea. We\u2019ve got false alarms going off in Hawaii. We\u2019ve got people talking about war coming on the peninsula. At the same time, we\u2019ve got the North Koreans and the South Koreans deciding they\u2019re going to march together in the Olympics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDo you have a sense at all that the rhetoric that we\u2019ve used, the fact that perhaps the diplomacy is not as front and center as some of the talk about our military options, that we might be driving a wedge with our South Korean allies? I know when I was secretary and trying to do the Six-Party Negotiations, the North Koreans loved to drive a wedge to pick off the Chinese or pick off the South Koreans or pick off the Russians, and it was really important not for the United States to get isolated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how should we read these initiatives between the North and South? And tell us about the diplomacy, because I think we\u2019re all in agreement, nobody really wants war on the peninsula, on the Korean Peninsula, despite the seriousness of the North Korean threat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, our diplomacy efforts, which began really last February, the first week I was \u2013 after I was sworn in, I was with the President in the Oval and the very first foreign policy challenge that he gave me was he said you\u2019ve got to develop a foreign policy approach to North Korea. And so we did and we worked that through the interagency process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd what we \u2013 I labeled it the peaceful pressure campaign; the President has since relabeled it the maximum pressure campaign. But it is \u2013 and I know people say, \u201cAh, we\u2019ve tried sanctions in the past. They never work.\u201d We\u2019ve never had a sanctions regime that is as comprehensive as this one, and we\u2019ve never had Chinese support for sanctions like we\u2019re getting now. Russia is a slightly different issue. But the Chinese have leaned in hard on the North Koreans to the point \u2013 part of this approach was to help the Chinese come to the realizations that North Korea for the last 50, 60 years may have been an asset to you; they\u2019re now a liability to you. And I mean, it\u2019s because of how events can play out on the Korean Peninsula. If China doesn\u2019t help us solve this problem, there are a lot of follow-on effects, and China is well aware of those.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think the diplomatic efforts are about unifying the international community around this sanctions campaign, which has been extraordinarily effective. As President Moon himself told us on the phone call \u2013 and I would tell you, we have probably \u2013 the level of communication that goes on between ourselves, South Korea, and China on this issue is pretty extraordinary. People would probably be surprised at how often we are on the phone with one another a week talking about this. Moon said the reason the South Koreans came to us was because they are feeling the bite of these sanctions. And we\u2019re seeing it in some of the intel, we\u2019re seeing it through anecdotal evidence coming out of defectors that are escaping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Japanese made a comment yesterday in our session that they have had over 100 North Korean fishing boats that have drifted into Japanese waters \u2013 two-thirds of the people on those boats have died \u2013 they weren\u2019t trying to escape \u2013 and the ones that didn\u2019t die, they wanted to go back home. So they sent them back to North Korea. But what they learned is they\u2019re being sent out in the wintertime to fish because there\u2019s food shortages, and they\u2019re being sent out to fish with inadequate fuel to get back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re getting a lot of evidence that these sanctions are really starting to hurt. And so the rapprochement of the North to the South, now they\u2019re on to the playbook that you know as well as anyone. And the playbook is, okay, we\u2019re going to start our charm offensive to the rest of the world and let them see we\u2019re just normal people like everybody else. We\u2019re going to engender some sympathy. We\u2019re going to try to drive a wedge between South Korea and their allies. And we spent an extraordinary amount of time yesterday in the group discussion hearing from Foreign Minister Kang of South Korea about how they\u2019re not going to let that happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we understand what this is about, and we\u2019ve been supportive of this rapprochement, because the other element of the diplomacy is we\u2019ve been waiting for Kim to decide he wants to talk. We\u2019ve been very clear, and our channels are open. And as I said yesterday in my press avail, he knows how to reach me if he wants to talk. But he\u2019s got to tell me he wants to talk. We\u2019re not going to chase him.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this may be their early effort to break the ice; we\u2019ll see. Nothing may come of it, but \u2013 we are supportive of that, but I would tell you that among the allies in the region, but equally with China, I don\u2019t think we have ever been as unified against this threat. Because China knows the potential consequences of this, to unintended consequences that could come later. And in diplomacy, where you\u2019re dealing with someone across the table like this, and when we get to that negotiating table \u2013 and I\u2019m confident we will \u2013 I want to know that Secretary Mattis has a very, very strong military option standing behind me. That will give me a better position from which to try to solve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs Secretary Mattis and I told our Chinese counterparts when we were across the table from one another in a security and strategic dialogue, I said to my counterpart, Yang Jiechi \u2013 I said, \u201cState Councilor, if you and I don\u2019t solve this, these guys get to fight, and we don\u2019t want that. And neither do you.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we are highly motivated. It is a long process. It\u2019s taken a lot of patience. We\u2019ll see. But we are committed, as is everyone in the international community, to a denuclearized North Korea. And we\u2019re going to stay on that until we achieve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY RICE:</strong> Thank you very much, and all the best. We certainly hope you succeed. Thank you very much.

The Secretary also held a meeting today with Nechirvan Barzani and also with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq.

The Secretary will remain in Davos tonight before he heads to Warsaw tomorrow afternoon. In Poland, he\u2019ll meet with senior Polish officials to discuss the range of issues in the strong U.S.-Poland bilateral relationship, including global challenges, regional security, and also economic prosperity.

And we look forward to trying to facilitate any kind of peace talks.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Can I ask you on UNRWA? You mentioned that UNRWA needs to be reformed. Has this administration given UNRWA a specific list of demands of the things that it wants to see reformed?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>We have spoken with representatives from UNRWA. We\u2019ve also spoken with other countries about the need to get other countries to provide more money and resources for UNRWA. We\u2019re pleased some countries have stepped up. Belgium is one of those countries that has; there are some others as well. So we\u2019re pleased that other countries recognize that they\u2019re \u2013 other countries need to do more. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In terms of the first part of your question, have we given specifics to UNRWA? Yes. Some of those are just \u2013 we consider to be more private diplomatic type conversations, but we have made clear to them the need to reform their funding mechanism, for example. The Secretary has spoken about this here at the State Department where he said, look, every year at the end of the year there is an emergency appeal for money. The system and the structure shouldn\u2019t be set up in such a way that every year they are running out of money and need to plead for emergency funds. So it\u2019s just not a sustainable program the way the funding mechanism is currently set up, and so we are promoting for UNRWA to develop a funding mechanism structure that is better sustaining. So that would be one of the examples, and we could -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Could you talk a little bit about why you \u2013 why you think that by cutting these funds for economic development programs, humanitarian aid, why that will do anything other than make people more hungry and angry and frustrated and drawn to radicalism?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I\u2019m just going to go back to what the President said before. And I\u2019m not quoting him, but in general we have seen a lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process for many, many decades \u2013 more decades than some of you have been alive. And so there needs to be a new way to try to get people back to the table, and perhaps this is one way that it can encourage and will encourage both sides to eventually return to the peace process.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Are you blaming only the Palestinians or primarily the Palestinians -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> -- for that situation recently?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we\u2019ve talked to both the Israelis and we\u2019ve certainly made clear to the Palestinian \u2013 Palestinians in the past that both sides need to come to the table, and that it\u2019s not going to be easy. Both sides will have to compromise.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> The President --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And you\u2019re quite clear that the Israelis are ready to come to the table?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think they are. I think they are. They\u2019ve indicated that in the recent past, so I don\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard or seen anything that would indicate otherwise.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> The President again stressed repeatedly today that he\u2019s taken Jerusalem off the table. Now that\u2019s done, that issue is done, he kept saying. Is Jerusalem off the table for negotiations?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>In what way?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Whether or not \u2013 I mean, the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as their future capital. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> That would be -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So is that off the table for the Palestinians?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>That would be a final status negotiation that would have to be determined by the Israelis and the Palestinians. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But he says he\u2019s taken it off the table.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think \u2013 and I can\u2019t parse the President\u2019s words. I\u2019m not in the position to do so. I think you all recognize that. But I think what the President was referring to at the time \u2013 if you go back and look at the time in which that was said, I think he was referring to \u2013 saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel from a U.S. perspective. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But he also said that the Israelis will have to pay for that in future talks. He said that again today.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Well, then I\u2019d have to refer you to the White House on that, because I can\u2019t speak for the President and I wasn\u2019t there as part of the comments.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Just to be clear \u2013 because the two things seem to have overlapped a bit in this discussion \u2013 the withholding of the money to UNRWA is to get UNRWA reformed?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Reformed, yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> It has nothing to do with whether the Palestinians come to the negotiating table?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>That is correct. Yes. And we have --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So what the President is talking about today is different aid?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes. I think he\u2019s talking about aid in general. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Okay?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> So can I ask why --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And why does the State Department --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Do you guys want to stick on Israeli-Palestinian stuff? Because I\u2019m going to have to go quickly. Is that \u2013 do you want to talk about other things?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Can I have a quick one on Turkey about yesterday\u2019s phone call between President Trump and Erdogan?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> It seems that the Turks are telling \u2013 claiming there is a mischaracterization of the content of the call in the White House readout. What do you make of this claim from Turkey?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think our \u2013 the call readout that was provided by the White House was very specific, it was very detailed, and it was firm. And I think it expressed both the President and the Secretary\u2019s extreme concern about the situation in northwestern Syria, in the Afrin area. So I think they were clear about that. I think the President and the Secretary \u2013 as the Secretary has in recent calls with the foreign minister of Turkey \u2013 been very clear that we want a de-escalation of tensions. This is a part of Syria that had been relatively stable. Again, it\u2019s Syria, but it had been relatively stable. And now we\u2019re <span><span><span>seeing something altogether different happen. We recognize and respect Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns, their concerns about the PKK. Turkey is a NATO partner and ally, so we understand and respect that, but I want to make something clear, that we don\u2019t have a U.S. presence in Afrin. Our U.S. presence is elsewhere. It\u2019s more in the eastern part of the country, where we\u2019ve been fighting \u2013 where we have been fighting ISIS. So we\u2019re not a part of that. We work with the Syrian Democratic Forces in the eastern part of that country to fight ISIS. We continue to do that, so \u2013 and we encourage the Turks and everybody else to put the focus on ISIS and not other groups.</span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Heather, the Turkish foreign minister and other Turkish officials said publicly that Tillerson proposed this idea for a 30-kilometer buffer zone. Tillerson said, \u201cI didn\u2019t propose anything.\u201d The Turks have come back and said no, really, you did. Do you have any clarity on \u2013 I mean, did they discuss it but it wasn\u2019t a formal proposal, or \u2013 can you, like, parse that for us?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>Yeah, and we put out some comments on this yesterday, and I want to talk a little bit about some of what the Secretary said. And he talked to I believe one of the pool reporters today when he landed in Davos. He said, \u201cWe discussed a number of possible options, but we didn\u2019t propose anything.\u201d So back to the readout for a second that was provided, we stand by the readout. We stand by the President\u2019s assertion of cautioning Turkey about the escalation of tensions in the Afrin area, and then the Secretary I think has also been clear by saying, look, we discussed a range of options with the Turks.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Was the 30-mile or kilometer buffer zone one of them?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I don\u2019t have that level of specificity that I can provide to you, but I think there was no formal proposal of anything. I think the Secretary was talking with Turkey \u2013 NATO ally \u2013 about hey, what do you all need, just as though he would talk to the Kurds, because he was speaking with Barzani today. So he\u2019s talking with both sides about what they would all need.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> The Turks are talking \u2013 you were saying that you\u2019re not involved in Afrin, but they\u2019re talking about moving on to Manbij, which \u2013 where there is a U.S. military base. Has the Secretary kind of drawn any red lines about where they can go?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>We have been clear with the Turks.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Have we relocated any U.S. personnel out of Manbij to make sure they don\u2019t get bombed by the Turks?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>State Department personnel?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Or U.S.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I \u2013 yeah, I can\u2019t comment on any DOD personnel because I just wouldn\u2019t have that level of knowledge, but I\u2019m not aware of any State Department personnel who\u2019ve been moved.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Can you explain what you mean \u2013 what \u2013 that Tillerson has been clear? Because Michele asked you whether he\u2019d drawn any red lines if they move to Manbij. What \u2013 when you say that Tillerson\u2019s been clear, clear about what?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>We\u2019ve been clear with \u2013 and some of these conversations I just can\u2019t get into that level of specificity, but we\u2019ve been very clear with the Turkish Government, Turkish officials both on the ground in Turkey and in the Secretary\u2019s private conversations with the foreign minister, as well as with President Trump\u2019s conversations with President Erdogan, that we do not want to see an escalation of tensions in any way, shape, or form. And part of that would of course include the town, the community of Manbij.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> Right, but the \u2013 but in terms of any U.S. action if the \u2013 because the U.S. troops are there.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I\u2019m not going to go forward with what we may or may not do, but all of them have made it clear that that would be an area that would be of major concern.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>QUESTION:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> And what is your level of confidence that the Turks are hearing those messages?</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><span><b><span><span><span>MS NAUERT: </span></span></span></b><span><span><span>I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re putting those messages out. We certainly hope that they will listen. As a NATO partner and ally, we think they should. We think that that would be a good thing. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not the only country that has this concern about an escalation of tensions. </span></span></span>There are many other partners and allies who are equally concerned about instability in Syria and taking the eye off of ISIS.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Would you say that the Turks have given assurances of any kind, or how would you characterize --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> I would not say that they\u2019ve given assurances. We\u2019re following this very closely. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Quick one on Burma/Myanmar.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have anything to say with regard to former Secretary Richardson\u2019s comments from yesterday beyond what you said yesterday? And secondly, were his comments in any way whatsoever coordinated with the State Department or the Trump administration?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> No, they were not coordinated with the administration. They were not. I can tell you that we share his concern. You all read his letter. It was very frank. He was not operating under the auspices of the U.S. Government. He was over there as a private citizen. And I think it was certainly a good opportunity, and we were certainly hopeful that he was named to that commission, but I\u2019ll let his words speak for themselves about what he felt \u2013 how he felt that commission was going.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> And what makes you think that the criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi is going to strengthen either her ability or her will to try to do some of the things that you would like seen done in Burma?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we didn\u2019t put out that statement. That was put out by Ambassador Richardson.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> But you said, \u201cWe share his concerns.\u201d</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we share his concern. Yeah, absolutely.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Right, right. So by that, I take it as kind of an endorsement with what he said. You share the concerns that he has, so --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, let me back up, then, because I can\u2019t endorse his actual words because he\u2019s not operating on behalf of the U.S. Government. But certainly it is a concerning situation and certainly we would like to see the advisory commission be able to help the situation there.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> What I don\u2019t get is why starting to be more explicit in criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi will necessarily help her or make her any more inclined to push the country in the direction that you would like against the wishes of the military, which still basically have more power under their constitution than she does. So -- </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> As you know, we\u2019ve had a series of conversations with the government there, both with Aung San Suu Kyi and also General Min. Those conversations are ongoing with the government in general. Our people on the ground, Ambassador Scot Marciel is very involved in this. So we continue to have those conversations. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We would eventually like to see the Rohingya be able to go home in a safe and voluntary fashion. We don\u2019t believe that it would be safe or voluntary if they were to be sent home right now. We\u2019re continuing to monitor that situation. It is a tremendous concern of the United States Government. We have put a lot of money, a lot of taxpayer dollars, into assisting the Rohingya both in Bangladesh and in Burma as well. So it remains a concern. We certainly note what Ambassador Richardson said about his concerns and why he says he\u2019s pulling out of the commission panel.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t think that undermines Aung San Suu Kyi?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, that was his \u2013 it was his choice. It was certainly his choice because he had concerns about the way that the advisory panel was running. And so I\u2019d just refer you back to his comments about that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, one of their tension points that both he has discussed and Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman has said is that he wanted to address the fate of these Reuters journalists who were actually there specifically investigating what happened to the Rohingya, and that the position of Myanmar\u2019s Government is these are completely unrelated because this is a press freedom thing, this is a Rohingya thing. Is it the position of the United States that the fate of those journalists is completely untethered from the Rohingya crisis?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve stated whether it\u2019s tied to it or it\u2019s not. It\u2019s certainly related. It\u2019s certainly related to democratic reforms that we would like to see take place in that country. I mean, we consistently call for greater press access to allow press to go out and report the facts. And one of our major concerns about the situation in the Northern Rakhine State is that reporters \u2013 and frankly, aid groups to some extent \u2013 have not been able to get in to report what\u2019s going on on the ground. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So I don\u2019t have the specifics of the reporters\u2019 case. I mean, I\u2019ve read reports, but I can\u2019t personally confirm what exactly the reporters were doing there. But if they were just out reporting the facts, and reporting the reality and the situation on the ground, that deserves to be shared with the world.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019re going to have to get going in a few minutes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> India is hosting \u2013 this time I\u2019ll go on.

They said they didn\u2019t think it would accomplish much.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s background call to preview the Secretary\u2019s upcoming trip to Texas, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and also Jamaica. Today we\u2019re joined by [Senior State Department Official One], who will be referred to as Senior State Department Official One. We\u2019re also joined by [Senior State Department Official Two], who will be referred to as Senior State Department Official Two. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is on background; it\u2019ll be embargoed until the end of the call. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And with that, I will turn it over to our senior State Department officials for opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take a few questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Thanks, [Moderator], very much. The Secretary is planning to leave on February 1st, and he will actually depart for Austin, Texas from the Greenbrier, which is in West Virginia, where he\u2019ll be giving a speech that morning. He will then speak to a group at the University of Texas of approximately 250 people, and he\u2019ll be greeted and hosted by the university president, Gregory Fenves. It\u2019s the Secretary\u2019s alma mater, so he\u2019s looking forward to returning. That speech should last about an hour. It\u2019ll be in the early afternoon. It\u2019ll be open. It\u2019ll be streamed on Facebook and all other vehicles. And there will be a Q&amp;A after the speech, and that Q&amp;A will be open to other questions, and so there might be questions relating to Latin America, which is what the speech will be about, but then there will \u2013 could also be questions relating to other countries in the world, and he\u2019ll be happy to answer those too.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>He\u2019ll then leave mid-afternoon and will go to Mexico City. And that evening, he\u2019s meeting with Mexican Government leaders at the ambassador\u2019s residence. And he\u2019ll stay overnight in \u2013 will stay overnight in Mexico City. And that morning, they\u2019ll \u2013 he\u2019ll meet with chiefs of missions. This is where the Secretary of State brings together chiefs of missions from certain countries and is able to talk to them in an informal setting about how things are going within their nation and listen to any concerns they have or anything they need from the Secretary. So at this particular chief of mission conference will be chiefs of missions from Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Belize, and the Caribbean. That\u2019s in the morning. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then later that day, late morning, he meets with the \u2013 Videgaray, the foreign minister. And then there\u2019ll be a joint press avail after that sometime before noon. And then some time in the early afternoon, he\u2019s going to meet with President Pena Nieto. And around mid-afternoon, probably around 3 o\u2019clock or so, he\u2019ll probably go to the Zocalo, or the Metropolitan Cathedral, although that is not definite.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then later that day, will fly to Panama City, so just \u2013 where there\u2019ll be refueling, and then he\u2019ll immediately go on to Bariloche in Argentina, arriving on Saturday morning. That day will then start around noon, where he\u2019ll go to \u2013 is expected to go to the Nahuel Huapi National Park. And right now, he\u2019s expected to ascend the summit on horseback, but there will also be a chairlift for those people that \u2013 reporters and others that want to go on the chairlift and film him coming up on the horseback, or who don\u2019t want to go on horseback. It will be your choice. And that takes care of that afternoon.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Sunday, it\u2019s Bariloche to Buenos Aires. So he\u2019ll arrive at Buenos Aires sometime closer to around noon. There\u2019ll be a wreath-laying at Saint Martin Plaza \u2013 at Saint Martin Palace, I\u2019m sorry, with the foreign minister. Then a meeting with the foreign minister and key cabinet ministers. There\u2019ll be a joint press avail sometime around 2:00, and then he\u2019ll meet that afternoon with chiefs of missions from that part of the world, and that would include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia. He is planning to meet the Panama ambassador when he \u2013 when the plane lands in Panama City.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The \u2013 there\u2019ll be a mission personnel meeting that afternoon, and then that evening is the Super Bowl, which he, along with many other people, will be watching. The next day he\u2019ll meet with President Macri in the morning. And then late morning, he\u2019ll leave Buenos Aires for Lima, when he \u2013 arriving in Lima around 2:00, where he\u2019ll meet with the foreign minister, Aljovin. There\u2019ll be a press avail for that. There\u2019ll be a meeting with the ambassador, the American ambassador to Peru, and that will take care of that evening. That \u2013 all that should take until around 6 o\u2019clock or so.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Tuesday he meets with the president of Peru, President Kuczynski, and will leave late morning to Bogota, where that afternoon he\u2019ll meet with the ambassador and then sometime around 4:00 meet with the president of Colombia, President Santos. There\u2019ll be a joint press avail, and then later after that he\u2019ll meet with the foreign minister, Holguin. That evening there\u2019s an informal working dinner with President Santos.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Wednesday morning he flies to Kingston, Jamaica. He\u2019ll meet with the prime minister, Holness, and Foreign Minister Johnson-Smith. And there\u2019ll be an expanded meeting after that, so basically a 20-minute meeting first and then another meeting. And then later that day he\u2019ll meet with the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the embassy, and will then fly back to Washington, landing somewhere around 7 to 8 o\u2019clock.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And I\u2019d like to introduce [Senior State Department Official Two], who can give you some more color relating to the purpose of the trip and why we\u2019ve chosen those particular countries.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. Secretary Tillerson\u2019s going to be making \u2013 embarking on his first multi-country trip to Latin America and the Caribbean this week. It\u2019s appropriate, as there are some very important events occurring in this hemisphere where U.S. leadership will be on display. There\u2019s the Summit of the Americas in Peru in April; in June, the G7 summit will take place in Canada; and later in the year, at the end of November, Argentina will host the G20 summit for the first time in South America. U.S. leadership will be on display as we work with our Latin American partners throughout the region.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary is engaging with regional partners on this trip to promote a safe, prosperous, energy-secure, and democratic hemisphere. We stand with the region as a steady, enduring partner. We\u2019re working hand in hand with partners to disrupt the transnational criminal organizations and trafficking routes that harm our hemisphere\u2019s citizens and drive illegal migration. The United States trades twice as much with this hemisphere as we do with China, and we will continue to enhance our trade and energy relationships to foster prosperity for our region. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We remain steadfast in our shared respect for democracy and human rights. The Secretary will continue to advocate for increased regional attention to the multiple crises in Venezuela. With our partners, we plan to continue to pressure the corrupt Maduro regime to return to democratic order.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With that, I\u2019ll stop and take questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> For our first question we\u2019ll go to <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> and the line of Tracy Wilkinson. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. How are you? Thank you for doing this. Gosh, I have a gazillion questions. Let\u2019s start with \u2013 [Senior State Department Official One], did you say that the Secretary will be meeting with Venezuelan officials in that meeting in Buenos Aires, or did I hear wrong?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> I \u2013 well, not officials, the \u2013 he\u2019s definitely not meeting with Venezuelan officials.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> I think he was talking about there will be a chief of mission conference --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I see. Okay. So a U.S. official from \u2013 who is stationed in --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Yeah, and our charg\u00e9 will --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Right. So when I mentioned --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Got it.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> -- all those countries, those are American charg\u00e9s -- charg\u00e9</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, that was my confusion. Okay, got it. Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>All right, so on \u2013 let\u2019s start with Colombia. There has been a lot of concern and talk on the \u2013 in Congress about the surge in coca production. Is this something you\u2019re going to be \u2013 or the Secretary will be raising with President Santos, and do you \u2013 is the position of this government, this administration, of you guys that the peace process has facilitated coca production, which is what some people claim?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then on Mexico, I know there\u2019s a lot of concern that the NAFTA talks could spoil other cooperation between Mexico and the United States in terms of immigration and drug trafficking and all of those things. So what will the Secretary\u2019s message be to Mexico vis-a-vis those talks? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> On Colombia, the Secretary absolutely is going to discuss the surge in coca production and cocaine production, but he\u2019s also going to note how we continue to work in close collaboration with the Colombian Government and its security forces to combat this problem of drug trafficking as it affects Colombia, as it affects the entire hemisphere, and the threat it poses to the United States. So we will most certainly raise that in Colombia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With regard to the question of NAFTA in Mexico, the Secretary\u2019s visit will once again underscore that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is deep and broad. He will talk about our joint efforts against transnational criminal organizations. He will underscore how our two governments are cooperating to prevent illegal migration from reaching our southwest border and how we\u2019re working together to address the underlying conditions that are prompting illegal migration from Central America through our joint efforts in Central America and in the Northern Triangle countries.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Next question, Nora Gamez from the <i>Miami Herald</i>.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Your line is now open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, hi, hello. Thank you for doing this. Senator Marco Rubio has sent a letter to the President asking to impose sanctions against Diosdado Cabello, and I wonder if State Department support that position, like imposing sanctions against Cabello.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And a quick question on Cuba: Will the Secretary Tillerson be addressing the situation in Cuba on his trip?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> The State Department, in line with the White House, will use all economic, political, and diplomatic tools at our disposal to address the situation in Venezuela. The upcoming undemocratic transition of political authority in Cuba is likely to be raised at multiple stops throughout the Secretary\u2019s trip.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Next question, please. Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit more about the intent of the Secretary\u2019s visit to Bariloche? What \u2013 aside from the visit to the national park, what message is he trying to send by visiting Bariloche and what does he hope to achieve there?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Well, very importantly, he\u2019s going to be meeting there with people who run the national park but also a Fulbright scholar. He\u2019s going to be talking about the kinds of scientific and research exchanges that are going on between the two countries. And at the national park, he will underscore how conservation at the park is advancing important goals as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Rafael Bernal from The Hill.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thank you for having this. With the chiefs of mission talk in Mexico City, you mentioned El Salvador and Honduras are going to be there. I wanted to know if the Secretary will address questions related to TPS. And on that question, I know Senator Cardin is holding up the OAS ambassador subject to the State Department releasing the documents that went from the embassy to State and then to DHS. Do you plan to release those to the Senate? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</b> Yeah. We\u2019re aware of the senator\u2019s request. I will have to get with our Legislative Affairs bureau to get a fuller answer to that question. But Temporary Protective Status is a Department of Homeland Security decision ultimately. There\u2019s no doubt that in our meeting with our ambassadors from that group, we will internally discuss the challenges and the opportunities that the TPS decision presents to our partners in the hemisphere.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> All right, thank you. Luis Alonso from AP. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Good morning for doing this. I would like to ask \u2013 well, it\u2019s a two-part question. First, the \u2013 it\u2019s the first multi-country trip to Latin America by the Secretary after he\u2019s been a full year in the job. Is \u2013 how the region should be reading the fact that it took him a year to visit several countries in the region?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And the second part of the question is specifically about Venezuela. There are some reports in the Spanish-language press saying that Secretary Tillerson may use this trip to the region to sound out regional leaders on a possible U.S. oil embargo against Venezuela. And also, now that I\u2019m at this, is the U.S. \u2013 does the U.S. have a preference on whether Peru, as the host of the summit, should invite or should not invite Venezuela to the summit? Thank you very much.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the Secretary\u2019s priority and attention towards \u2013 towards the Western Hemisphere began with his first bilateral trip abroad, which was to Mexico. And I think this trip builds on his engagement in the Western Hemisphere throughout the past year, and the meetings he\u2019s had here in Washington with different leaders demonstrates that he has been engaged, and this trip will allow him to deepen and broaden those relationships. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Regarding the Summit of the Americas, we look forward to participating in that summit. The summit\u2019s theme of democratic governance in anti-corruption efforts will allow us to underscore and highlight the corrupt practices that are occurring in Venezuela under the Maduro regime. President Maduro, if invited and if he attends, will have to answer to the rest of the democratic nations of this hemisphere while he has pursued \u2013 why he has pursued illegitimate elections over the last year, and we would look forward to that discussion.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Last question, is that what you\u2019re saying, or another one? Okay. Maria Molina with Radio Colombia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi. I wanted to ask you if there is a further strategy from the U.S. apart from the sanctions to Venezuela, because right now, apparently, they are not seeming to be really, really effective. So I wanted to ask if there \u2013 if you were thinking about a further strategy not related to sanctions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> Our strategy on Venezuela has been extremely effective. Over the last year, we sanctioned more than 50 individuals. The Lima Group has joined this effort and created an additional hemispheric pressure entity on Caracas. The Canadian Government has also sanctioned individuals in Venezuela, and just last week, the European Union joined the international pressure campaign to hold individuals who are violating human rights in Venezuela, who are responsible for antidemocratic practices and who are robbing the national treasury of the country, by imposing their own international sanctions. The pressure campaign is working. The financial sanctions we have placed on the Venezuelan Government has forced it to begin becoming in default, both on sovereign and PDVSA, its oil company\u2019s, debt. And what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the Maduro regime is a total economic collapse in Venezuela. So our policy is working, our strategy is working and we\u2019re going to keep it on the Venezuelans. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> And our final question, Christina Garcia from EFC.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thank you for having this call. I just want to confirm that the \u2013 Secretary Tillerson is going to the Summit of the Americas, and also, is President Trump also going? Thank you so much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> The Summit of the Americas invitations are due out in the next couple of weeks, and we will make decisions on the \u2013 the U.S. Government participation at that time. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. And any final comments that anyone want to wrap up with here? [Senior State Department Official One]? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIORE STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> No, I think it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing you on the trip.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICAL TWO:</b> And I just \u2013 I just also want to underscore in talking about our sanctions. They are targeted at the responsible \u2013 members of the regime in Venezuela. And it\u2019s really important that our financial sectors are targeted at the placement of additional debt by the Venezuelan Government. Not a single corn \u2013 ear of corn \u2013 not a single medicine container, not anything that could help the Venezuelan people is blocked by our sanctions. Our goal is to help the Venezuelan people deal with this economic crisis, but also restore democratic order so that they can be in charge of their future again. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you so much, sir. Thanks, everybody. The embargo will now be lifted, and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And thank you, Greg, for that very kind, warm introduction, inviting me back home today. And I want to thank those at the Clements Center of National Security and the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law for hosting the event as well.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs Greg mentioned to you, today does mark my one-year anniversary as Secretary of State. A year ago this time, I had entered the State Department, stood on the steps in the foyer, and had my first chance to have a conversation with my newest colleagues and friends in the State Department about things that are important to me and values that I wanted to bring to the State Department. And it\u2019s been a very busy, whirlwind year, but it\u2019s really nice to celebrate it among friends back home as well. So I\u2019m just delighted to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, it\u2019s always a special honor and pleasure to get to speak at your alma mater, and in particular, an institution that houses the presidential library of one of our most storied Texans to serve in Washington.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLBJ bemoaned, as some of you may know, what he considered an East Coast, elitist approach to foreign policy. He once said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever get credit for anything I do in foreign affairs, no matter how successful it is, because I didn\u2019t go to Harvard.\u201d (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI didn\u2019t either, and worse, I\u2019m an engineer. (Laughter.) But I got one up on LBJ: He didn\u2019t go to the University of Texas. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have said before that this University shaped me in so many ways, both personal and professional. An interesting story: When I was a freshman in the Longhorn Band, a group of about one hundred members of the band flew down to Peru for a special mission trip. There had been a major earthquake in Peru, and enormous refugee problem coming out of the mountains into the area of Lima. And a group of Texans went down to help raise money and bring awareness to the situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt was an extraordinary trip \u2013 interestingly, first passport I got. Went to the passport office, got my first passport, first foreign country I ever visited was with the University of Texas Longhorn Band to Peru. And it was interesting; it was a very successful trip. The band was a huge hit down in Lima, and the U.S. ambassador to Peru even expressed he had some concerns that \u201cThe Eyes of Texas\u201d was going to replace \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d as the official \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 anthem at the events. Regrettably, we left for that trip after a loss at the Cotton Bowl, but the Showband of the Southwest won in Peru, I assure you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as I look to the coming weeks, when I will return to Peru on my first multi-stop visit to Latin America as Secretary of State, it does feel a bit like coming full circle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m proud today UT Austin\u2019s Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, its Mexico Center, and its host of international programs do contribute to educate students about this very important region of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis trip comes at an important time for the Western Hemisphere. This diverse region \u2013 which includes Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean \u2013 is a priority for the United States for reasons other than simply our geographic proximity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe share an interwoven history and chronology. Our nations still reflect the New World optimism of limitless discovery. And importantly, we share democratic values \u2013 values that are at the core of what we believe, regardless of the color of our passport.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd for generations, U.S. leaders have understood that building relationships with Latin American and Caribbean partners is integral to the success and prosperity of our region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 1889, at the urging of then-Secretary of State James Blaine, the United States hosted the First International Conference of American States \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s OAS, or Organization of American States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the beginning of the 20th century, President Teddy Roosevelt visited Panama \u2013 the first foreign visit of a U.S. sitting president in our history.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd during the 1960s, President Kennedy established the Alliance for Progress \u2013 his ambitious plan to strengthen economic cooperation among the United States and the hemisphere, and to, in his words, \u201celiminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, we share these same goals as the visionary leaders before us: to eliminate tyranny and to further the cause of economic and political freedom throughout our hemisphere. As 2018 begins, we have an historic opportunity to do just that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few weeks ago, the United States cohosted a ministerial with our counterparts in Canada in Vancouver. Twenty countries joined us to discuss the global threat posed by North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn April, Peru will host the Summit of the Americas to highlight our region\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption. Two months later, Canada will host the 44th G7 Summit. And at the end of this year, the G20 states will convene in Buenos Aires, the first South American city ever to host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in many ways, 2018 marks the year of the Americas. Many of the world\u2019s leaders will be in this hemisphere, and as such, the eyes of the world will turn to the Americas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today I want to focus on three pillars of engagement to further the cause of freedom throughout our region in 2018 and beyond: economic growth, security, and democratic governance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe hemisphere has significant potential for greater economic growth and prosperity. We will build upon the solid foundation of economic cooperation with our Latin American and Caribbean partners. Brazil, for instance, is the region\u2019s largest economy and the ninth largest in the world. The United States is Brazil\u2019s second-largest trading partner, with two-way trade at record highs in recent years totaling more than $95 billion in 2015.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries; 12 of those countries are in the Western Hemisphere. And every year, the United States trades almost $2 trillion worth of goods and services with Latin America and Caribbean nations, supporting more than 2.5 million jobs here at home. Instead of a trade deficit, we actually have a $14 billion trade surplus with the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut today we have an opportunity to further our economic partnership and the prosperity of the peoples in this hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important step to strengthen North American economic prosperity and integration is to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m a Texan, former energy executive, and I\u2019m also a rancher. I understand how important NAFTA is for our economy and that of the continent. But it should come as no surprise that an agreement put into place 30 years ago, before the advent of the digital age and the digital economy, before China\u2019s rise as the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2013 that NAFTA would need to be modernized.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur aim is simple: to strengthen our economy and that of all of North America, to remain the most competitive, economically vibrant region in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the hard work of our Mexican and Canadian counterparts throughout these negotiations. Last week, we concluded round six, and we will continue to work toward a modernized agreement with another round scheduled next month.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"energy\" name=\"energy\"></a>Building greater prosperity by integrating the wealth of energy resources within the hemisphere is an opportunity that is unique in the world to the Americas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past decade, North America has been leading an energy renaissance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy 2040, North America is expected to add more oil production to the global markets than the entire rest of the world combined and more gas production than any other single region. The flow of crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and electricity already crosses our borders in both directions, leading to greater reliability, more efficiency, and lower costs to consumers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur continent has become the energy force for this century, thanks in large part to rapid expansion in natural gas and tight oil production, and, of course, thanks to some great engineers, many produced right here at UT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe rest of the hemisphere can use the North American experience as a model. We see a future where energy connectivity from Canada to Chile can build out and seize upon energy integration throughout the Americas, delivering greater energy security to the hemisphere and stability to growing economies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSouth America is blessed with abundant energy resources. Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina all have significant undeveloped oil and natural gas. The United States is eager to help our partners develop their own resources safely, responsibly, as energy demand continues to grow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcuse me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur hemispheric energy trade is already beginning to meet these needs: 36 percent of U.S. liquefied natural gas exports since 2016 have landed in Latin America. That\u2019s more than any other region in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBetween now and 2030, Latin America is expected to spend at least $70 billion on new electric power generation plants to fuel economic growth. Many of those plants will be powered by natural gas. The United States should be a substantive and reliable supplier.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy building out a more flexible and robust energy system in our hemisphere, we can power our economies with affordable energy. We can lift more people out of poverty. And we can make our hemisphere the undisputed seat of global energy supply. To support and capture this opportunity requires the opening of more market economies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe opening of energy markets in Mexico, for example, has led to greater private investment, more competition, and more energy trade with the United States than ever before. Truly, a win-win.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFurther south, we are partnering with Central America to strengthen its regional electricity market and modernize its grid. Creating stronger Central American economies by lowering energy cost is critical to building a more secure Central America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have the chance to develop an energy partnership that spans the Western Hemisphere, to the benefit of all of our citizens. We cannot afford to squander this moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA transition to more market-based economic reforms are not limited to the energy sector. Argentina, under President Macri\u2019s leadership, has made monumental strides in delivering reforms to open the Argentine economy and pursue growth for all Argentinians. Its historically high inflation rate is finally decreasing. GDP is going up, spurred on by investment and soaring consumer confidence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd one week after the U.S. Congress passed landmark tax reform policy, Argentina\u2019s legislature took action to overhaul their tax system as well. All of these efforts are making the second-largest economy in South America ripe for more investment and growth. We hope more countries take a similar path \u2013 to help the entire hemisphere grow in prosperity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut for prosperity to take root, we must create the conditions for regional stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEconomic development and security reinforce each other. When individuals are living in poverty, a life of crime can look like the only opportunity available to make a living. Legal and illegal immigration increases as people look for more opportunity elsewhere. And innocent people are more likely to become victims of drug cartels, human traffickers, and corrupt law enforcement authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States approach is holistic \u2013 we must address security and development issues side by side. You cannot expect to have one without the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe most immediate threat to our hemisphere are transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs. In their pursuit of money and power, TCOs leave death and destruction in their wake. As humans, weapons, opioids, and other drugs are smuggled, law enforcement and civilians become the targets.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHere at home, Americans do not necessarily see the day-to-day violence that is \u2013 violence that is so common in other parts of our hemisphere. But U.S. demand for drugs drives this violence and this lawlessness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe acknowledge our role as the major market for illicit drug consumption and the need for shared approaches to address these challenges. The opioid epidemic we are facing in this country is a clear, tragic representation of how interconnected our hemisphere truly is. Violence and drugs do not stop at our southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat is why we continue to employ a coordinated, multilateral approach to diminish the influence of these groups. It is time we rid our hemisphere of the violence and devastation that they promote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI co-chair a high-level dialogue with Foreign Secretary Videgaray of Mexico to discuss new and strategic ways to disrupt TCOs. We must take new approaches to disrupt their business models \u2013 models of cartels which operate much like any other business organization that maximizes their value chain from feedstock to manufacturing to distribution to marketing and sales.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second meeting of our dialogue was held in Washington this past December, which included Secretary Nielsen of the Department of Homeland Security and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as our Mexican counterparts. We also had with us law enforcement representatives from both countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDismantling TCOs is not just a diplomatic issue. Obviously, it requires integrating the skills and expertise of law enforcement to interdict shipments of illegal drugs, attack the revenue streams and the weapons feeding TCOs, and to track down and prosecute the middlemen who enable them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tClose collaboration among multiple agencies \u2013 within our own government, and with our international partners \u2013 is essential. The way we combat threats to our southern border security is to work collaboratively with Mexico to strengthen Mexico\u2019s southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThrough the Merida Initiative \u2013 a partnership between the United States and Mexico focused on improving security and the rule of law \u2013 the United States is providing assistance to build the capacity of Mexican law enforcement and judicial institutions. By providing inspection equipment, canine units, and training, we equip law enforcement officers with tools to eradicate opium poppy production, tighten border security, and disrupt trafficking activities \u2013 not just in drugs but in trafficking of humans. By improving cross-border communications, we make both sides of the border safer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd our security partnerships extend beyond just our southern border or Mexico\u2019s southern border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tColombia has been one of our strongest partners in the region. Following decades of long internal battle with Revolutionary Forces of the FARC, Colombia has charted a pathway to peace. We continue to support this sustainable peace, but challenges do remain. Colombia is the world\u2019s largest producer of cocaine \u2013 the source of 92 percent of the cocaine seized in the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast year, and with U.S. support, Colombian police and military forces eradicated 130,000 acres of coca fields \u2013 the highest number since 2010. The same year, Colombian forces seized nearly 500 metric tons of cocaine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere is more work ahead. Regrettably, coca cultivation has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2016, more than 460,000 acres in Colombia were used for coca cultivation \u2013 a record. We remain a very \u2013 we remain and keep a very open and frank dialogue with the Government of Colombia to address the eradication of this very large feedstock for cocaine and to identify alternative cash crops to support rural Colombian farmers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Central America, through the Alliance for Prosperity, we support countries as they address security and economic development in tandem. Last June in Miami, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, along with our Mexican counterparts, cohosted the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America. Through many productive conversations with public and private sector leaders across the region, opportunities were identified to help Central American countries grow their economies, strengthen their institutions, and better protect their people. More opportunities for Central Americans will weaken the hold of transnational criminal organizations, address the underlying causes of legal and illegal immigration, and result in less violence. That makes their nations stronger, and it makes ours safer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, partners along our third border, the Gulf of Mexico, are increasing their ability to perform maritime interdictions, rein in illegal firearms, counter corruption, and prosecute criminals. Over the summer we submitted our Caribbean 2020 Plans. This comprehensive strategy fosters closer security cooperation and reaffirms our commitment to encourage private sector growth and diversification of energy resources, creating energy security in the Caribbean. We also maintain our partnerships in education and health initiatives, including PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States knows that our country \u2013 and the rest of the region \u2013 benefits from greater regional stability and the prospect of a growing economy throughout the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States\u2019 partnership with nations in the hemisphere is founded on shared values and democratic governance, but we cannot take it for granted. Many still live under the oppression of tyranny.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe corrupt and hostile regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela clings to a false dream and antiquated vision for the region that has already failed its citizens. It does not represent the vision of millions of Venezuelans \u2013 or in any way comport with the norms of our Latin American, Canadian, or Caribbean partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur position has not changed. We urge Venezuela to return to its constitution \u2013 to return to free, open, and democratic elections \u2013 and to allow the people of Venezuela a voice in their government. We will continue to pressure the regime to return to the democratic process that made Venezuela a great country in the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela stands in stark contrast to the future of stability pursued by so many others in the hemisphere. The great tragedy is that although Venezuela could be one of the most prosperous countries in the region, it is one of the poorest in the world. Venezuela GDP growth in 2004 was as high as 18 percent. Ten years later, it is nearly a negative 4 percent \u2013 all the result of man-made collapse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela boasts the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, but riches are reserved only for the ruling elites. As a consequence, the people suffer. Venezuelans are starving, looting is common, and the sick do not receive the medical attention they desperately need. Venezuelans are dying of malnutrition and disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere has been no natural disaster \u2013 nothing like that earthquake that took me to Peru. The Venezuelan people suffer because of a corrupt regime that steals from its own people. The Maduro regime is squarely to blame and must be held to account.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States has imposed sanctions on more than 40 current or former Venezuelan government officials \u2013 individuals who support Maduro and his efforts to undermine democracy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past year, we have worked with many of our Latin American partners \u2013 through the Lima Group and the Organization of American States in particular \u2013 to build support for coordinated action to counter the country\u2019s slide into dictatorship. We appreciate the Lima Group of major regional leaders who have met regularly to support the Venezuelan people\u2019s quest to regain their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCanada too has sanctioned dozens of Venezuelan leaders, including Maduro himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd recently, the European Union joined the growing global chorus to sanction leaders in the regime for human rights abuses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe world is waking to the plight of the Venezuelan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe encourage all nations to support the Venezuelan people. The time has come to stand with freedom-loving nations, those that support the Venezuelan people, or choose to stand with the Maduro dictatorship, if that is your choice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tElsewhere we will continue to encourage others in the region, like Cuba, who disregard their people and ignore this democratic moment in Latin America, to give their people the freedom that they deserve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCuba has an opportunity in their own transfer of power from decades of the Castro regime to take a new direction. In June, President Trump laid out a new vision for our approach to Cuba \u2013 one that supports the Cuban people by steering economic activity away from the military, intelligence, and security service which disregard their freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe administration\u2019s policy \u2013 as written in the National Security Presidential Memorandum \u2013 also seeks to, quote, \u201censure that the engagement between the United States and Cuba advances the interests of the United States and that of the Cuban people.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt includes advancing human rights and encouraging the nascent private sector in Cuba. The future of our relationship is up to Cuba \u2013 the United States will continue to support the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVenezuela and Cuba remind us that for our hemisphere to grow and thrive, we must prioritize and promote democratic values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe must root out corruption in all of its forms. Ineffective, corrupt governance damages countries. The economy suffers. People lose faith in institutions. And crime increases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRecent steps taken against corruption in Guatemala, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil underscore the importance of directly addressing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Guatemala, we continue to support the CICIG \u2013 a UN body created in 2006 \u2013 to uphold the rule of law, strengthen accountability, and independently investigate illegal, corrupt activity affecting government institutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t2018 should be the year countries in the Western Hemisphere restore their trust with their people, the people they represent, and take serious anti-corruption action.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEarlier as I mentioned the Summit of the Americas, hosted by Peru \u2013 will be hosted by Peru in April. We wholeheartedly support this year\u2019s theme: \u201cDemocratic Governance Against Corruption.\u201d And we encourage every nation in the region to fully embrace it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEncouraging transparency, increasing accountability, rooting out corruption \u2013 all of these are essential to creating a sound economy for the region, promoting security, and protecting our values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrong institutions and governments that are accountable to their people also secure their sovereignty against potential predatory actors that are now showing up in our hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina \u2013 as it does in emerging markets throughout the world \u2013 offers the appearance of an attractive path to development. But in reality, this often involves trading short-term gains for long-term dependency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust think about the difference between the China model of economic development and the United States version.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina\u2019s offer always come at a price \u2013 usually in the form of state-led investments, carried out by imported Chinese labor, onerous loans, and unsustainable debt. The China model extracts precious resources to feed its own economy, often with disregard for the laws of the land or human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, China is gaining a foothold in Latin America. It is using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit. The question is: At what price?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina is now the largest trading partner of Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. While this trade has brought benefits, the unfair trading practices used by many Chinese have also harmed these countries\u2019 manufacturing sectors, generating unemployment and lowering wages for workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLatin American \u2013 Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people. China\u2019s state-led model of development is reminiscent of the past. It doesn\u2019t have to be this hemisphere\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRussia\u2019s growing presence in the region is alarming as well, as it continues to sell arms and military equipment to unfriendly regimes who do not share or respect democratic values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur region must be diligent to guard against faraway powers who do not reflect the fundamental values shared in this region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands in vivid contrast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe do not seek short-term deals with lopsided returns. We seek partners with shared values and visions to create a safe, secure, and prosperous hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. approach is based on mutually beneficial goals to help both sides grow, develop and become more prosperous, and do so by respecting international law, prioritizing the interests of our partners, and protecting our values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith the United States, you have a multidimensional partner \u2013 one that benefits both sides with engagement to support economic growth, education, innovation, and security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year the United States is eager to create even deeper relationships with Latin America and Caribbean partners, with the aim of expanding freedom to more people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have a tremendous opportunity to build upon our shared history, culture, and values to generate more opportunity, more stability, more prosperity, and more resilient governance in South America, Central America, North America, and the Caribbean.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this year of the Americas, the United States will continue to be the Western Hemisphere\u2019s steadiest, strongest, and most enduring partner. Thank you for your kind attention.

I\u2019m the executive director of the Clements Center and a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, a couple of your hosts for today. And honored to have so many of our students here in the audience, and we\u2019re going to be hearing from a few of those students in a little bit.\n\n\n<p>\n\tMr. Secretary, as you and I were visiting out back beforehand, we were remembering the first time we met was a couple years ago, and at that time, you were in the private sector and I had given a foreign policy speech to a group of UT alums, of whom you were in the audience. And as we recalled, you asked me some very probing questions in that \u2013 after my lecture, and I don\u2019t --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> (Laughter.) What goes around comes around, I guess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> That\u2019s right. I \u2013 the tables have turned, sir. I don\u2019t think either of us expected two years later we\u2019d be here on the one-year anniversary of being Secretary, so, anyway, so my turn to ask some questions. I\u2019m going to ask the Secretary a few questions, we\u2019ll have a colloquy here, and then we\u2019re going to hear from a few of our students as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, Mr. Secretary, I\u2019m a historian by training, and whenever I\u2019m looking at current foreign policy issues, I always like to think about the historical context. And as our history students here will know, in a few years, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, which, for a very young United States, was our assertion of \u2013 our efforts to keep European colonial powers out of the Western Hemisphere to protect our security but also to promote the three pillars of the speech you talked about today: security, liberty, and prosperity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, you as Secretary, you kind of inherit that 200-year tradition. Looking back, how would you regard the Monroe Doctrine? Has it been more of a success or a failure, especially as you look at our challenges today?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think it clearly has been a success, because as I mentioned at the top, what binds us together in this hemisphere are shared democratic values, and while different countries may express that democracy not precisely the same way we practice democracy in this country, the fundamentals of it \u2013 respect for the dignity of the human being, respect for the individual to pursue life, liberty, happiness \u2013 those elements do bind us together in this hemisphere. So I think it clearly was an important commitment at the time, and I think over the years, that has continued to frame the relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, it\u2019s easy for the United States as a country, because of our size and our engagements with so many countries and regions around the world, to, through nothing more than just perhaps a period of neglect, to let certain relationships atrophy a bit. And we\u2019ve gone \u2013 I think we\u2019ve gone through those periods of time in our history as well, and if you look back and whether \u2013 you can go by individual country or regionally as well, due to other events, sometimes I think we have forgotten about the importance of the Monroe Doctrine and what it meant to this hemisphere and maintaining those shared values. So I think it\u2019s as relevant today as it was the day it was written.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Okay, cool. John Quincy Adams would be happy to hear that, so. (Laughter.) You mentioned in your speech NAFTA and the ongoing renegotiations and efforts to bring it up to speed, and it was on the presidential campaign trail in 1980 that candidate Ronald Reagan was the first American political leader to call for a North American free trade accord, which soon thereafter became NAFTA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as you mentioned, we\u2019ve been living with this vision and this reality for quite a while. As we\u2019re \u2013 as our country is in the midst of the NAFTA renegotiations, what would you describe as the \u2013 what have been the strengths and the weaknesses of NAFTA as currently constituted?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think \u2013 again, and as I mentioned, when it was put in place 30 years ago, the world was a bit of a different place. Supply chains didn\u2019t function the way they do today \u2013 again, I mention the advent of the digital age, the digital economy, which has completely disrupted supply chains and how they function. The rise of China now as the second largest economy in the world, and China growing its economy by spreading out its own trading relationships \u2013 all of those have had an impact on NAFTA\u2019s ability to respond \u2013 the agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that\u2019s why I think \u2013 we think about it as a need to modernize the agreement. I think the strength of building upon the fact that with shared borders, there are clear efficiencies to be gained that serve all three countries well and creates more value, and that\u2019s \u2013 in the global world of competition and trade, and whether you\u2019re building automobiles or whatever you\u2019re manufacturing or whatever you\u2019re doing agriculturally, you are competing with others. And when we can integrate the strengths of these three countries that share this border \u2013 if we can lower our cost of supply by that much, we just won, we just beat the other trading partners.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think \u2013 and that was always the vision in the beginning, and I think where it\u2019s \u2013 where it\u2019s having trouble and struggling today is because it\u2019s not been able to respond to that outside competitive force as effectively as perhaps it should. So we\u2019re hoping we can get to a modernized agreement. I\u2019m not directly engaged in those negotiations; I stay close to them because they do intersect with our foreign policy agenda as well. I can tell you it\u2019s \u2013 these are tough negotiations, and I\u2019m sure some of you are hearing about that, but the parties are continuing to work, I think, towards a solution that serves all three countries\u2019 interests well, but then collectively achieves the subjective of collectively making us the most competitive trading entity in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>So I want to come back to another country that you mentioned towards the end of your \u2013 end of your speech, and that\u2019s Cuba, one of the two remaining tyrannies in the region along with Venezuela. President Trump has been quite critical of the Obama administration\u2019s previous normalization process with Cuba, with the Castro regime. But as you mentioned in June when the President announced some new regulations \u2013 or a few months ago, in November when he announced some new regulations, some Cuban American groups worried that those didn\u2019t go far enough in reversing the previous administration\u2019s policies. So what would you say are your strategic priorities towards Cuba going forward?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as I mentioned, they\u2019re \u2013 they will be going through a transfer of power \u2013 supposed to this year, we\u2019ll see whether it happens this year or not, but \u2013 and this will be, in all likelihood, the first transfer of power that Cuba has not been led under a Castro regime, so that we think there are opportunities, perhaps, for \u2013 an opportunity to shift towards a more open and democratic future. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to our objectives with Cuba, and the \u2013 I think President Trump\u2019s analysis \u2013 and I agree with it \u2013 of the terms with Cuba that were in place when we took office, that an awful lot had been given to the Cuban Government, and not much had been received in return, other than a clear economic opportunity for U.S. business interests, which is great.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut that was coming on the backs of the Cuban people, who are still very repressed. So we have taken a shift, we preserved a lot of that, but basically said, \u201cYes, we do want to support the Cuban people.\u201d We\u2019re not interested in supporting the Cuban regime. And as you know, the government and the security forces and others have a significant presence in almost all economic activity. So one of our objectives was to separate that and allow the Cuban people to have a more full, rewarding participation in that economy, and limit what we\u2019re \u2013 what the government is benefiting from through their ownership.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that was one of the significant changes, but again, it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s all directed at how do we help the Cuban people. That\u2019s what we want to do is help the Cuban people, and we are hopeful, and we stay \u2013 we do stay engaged with the Cuban authorities that \u2013 in this transition, can they find their way to maybe a different future? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>Yeah, we\u2019ll see. Great. Well, as a professor, I could go on all day with more and more of my questions, this and that, but I think we\u2019ll all be a little more interested to hear from some of our students. So we\u2019ve got a number of students with questions for you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN: </strong>And we\u2019ve got microphones that are coming down the alleys, and all the rest of you, if you\u2019re not a student, sorry, no questions from you. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right, let\u2019s see. First one up, we\u2019ve got Patricia Zavala, so \u2013 Patricia, where are you? So \u2013 that\u2019s right, there you go. Galen, the mike to Patricia, so \u2013 and please identify your degree program and school, that\u2019s right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello, Secretary Tillerson. My name is Patricia Zavala. I\u2019m a dual-degree master\u2019s student at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, and the Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies. And my question is about corruption in Latin America, which is something that you touched on in your speech. Given the effect that corruption has in undermining public institutions and impeding the effective implementation of the administration\u2019s policy priorities, what can the U.S. do to combat the endemic corruption in the region?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, now I mentioned a number \u2013 we have a number of initiatives and funding programs working directly with individual countries \u2013 the U.S. directly but also using other UN and other international organizations to, first and foremost, strengthen the judicial systems. If we can get judicial systems and judges that are not corruptible, then you can begin to prosecute cases of corruption and punish people, and then that begins to dissuade them. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s the approach. Now, that does then raise significant risk for those judges, so hand in glove with it goes strengthening law enforcement and security in the region and in those countries to protect those who are taking action to eradicate corruption. And there is \u2013 without question, there\u2019s an intersection of a lot of the trans-criminal organizations with the corruption as well to facilitate their narcotics activities, their human trafficking activities, other kind of illicit smuggling.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is quite \u2013 it\u2019s quite challenging, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in Central America with these initiatives using \u2013 and in Mexico with the Merida Initiative that I mentioned \u2013 those are all specifically targeted at exactly the issue that you\u2019re asking about, but it is strengthening judicial systems, getting judges in place that will act in accordance with their law, in some cases passing new prosecutorial laws that make it easier to prosecute corruption. A lot of these are evidentiary laws. If you don\u2019t have good evidentiary laws, you can\u2019t make the case for a prosecution \u2013 and then creating an environment where these judges can do their job, recognizing that some of them are going to come under threat.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s very targeted, and we try to go country by country as to what is best needed there. But both in Mexico and in Latin America, it\u2019s a significant undertaking. That really is what\u2019s necessary to create the kind of environment then to allow economic prosperity, growth, job creation. That\u2019s what keeps everybody at home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right, thanks. All right, our next question from Juan Gonzalez-Rivera.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello, Mr. Secretary of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Hello, Juan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> My question is \u2013 first, I\u2019m a Fulbright student from Colombia. I\u2019m a candidate for PhD in chemical engineering, so my question is about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Future ExxonMobil. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> My question is about your science --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Or future State Department. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> About your science diplomacy agenda. So in your upcoming travel to Latin America, will there be a science strategic agenda to foster scientific cooperation in topics of interest to the region, or other topics of interest to the region such as food security, infectious diseases, and, of course, the environment?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think, as you point \u2013 you just touched on areas that are obvious for cooperation and scientific investigation, and certainly the \u2013 South America in particular has some incredibly rich ecology areas, things that we can learn a lot about what\u2019s happening with the environment, what\u2019s happening with the planet, what is the effect of climate change that we\u2019re seeing. And so yes, there are important joint scientific efforts for us to fund, send our own scientists there, but also bring scientists from Latin and South America to our institutions in the United States \u2013 and like yourself \u2013 to study and share, grow, and either go back home to continue that work or stay here. So it\u2019s \u2013 there are environmental issues of interest, there are diseases that are of particular interest in certain environments in particular, and that\u2019s why we have a very active PEPFAR program. As you know, it\u2019s AIDS, but it\u2019s also malaria and a few other infectious diseases that are important.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is an opportunity for us to talk about how are those collaborations that are in place going, what could we do to either strengthen those or expand them, and what new areas of investigation might be of interest to both of us. Certainly, the strong educational ties between our two countries and the fact that you\u2019re here studying at the University of Texas \u2013 and congratulations on being a Fulbright scholar \u2013 those are the strong connections that down the road \u2013 and these are the people-to-people connections \u2013 that are going to keep our countries very, very close together in terms of our values as well. And all the best to you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. Okay, another student question. We\u2019ve got Sean Salome there. The microphone\u2019s coming down. And Mr. Secretary, Sean, who\u2019s about to ask you the question, he\u2019s one of our Clements Center undergraduates. He\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s studying, but he\u2019s also a Marine vet who did a couple of deployments in Colombia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>God bless you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Good afternoon, Secretary. Thank you for having us. Colombia\u2019s facing a crossroads right now. Its neighbor to the east, Venezuela, is deteriorating as its continued government is strangulating the people. We\u2019re having mass migration of Venezuelans enter Colombia. Internally, Colombia\u2019s government and the ELN have failed peace talks, and these issues may very well lead to social unrest and economic turmoil for Colombians. How does this U.S. plan \u2013 or U.S. aid plan on aiding the Colombian people, and should the FARC be part of this process? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as you know, they have a very prescribed process to work through the implementation of the peace accord, and I would share your observation that it has stalled a bit. They were making good progress and now some areas that are important seem to have hit a pause. That\u2019s one of the areas we will be talking with the Santos government about: How can we get those restarted, continue the \u2013 we think it\u2019s important to continue to implement the peace accord if we\u2019re going to secure the peace that has been negotiated with the FARC, FLN<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou are correct in terms of Colombia is probably the most impacted country from the Venezuelan crisis. Something between 200- and 300,000 Venezuelans have now left Venezuela, living in Colombia as refugees, basically, but another couple of hundred thousand that are going back and forth all the time, just seeking food and medical treatment in particular. We have attempted to provide certain medical equipment \u2013 vaccines and others \u2013 to the Venezuelan Government so these people don\u2019t have to leave to get their treatments. The Venezuelan Government refuses to take that aid. Maduro does not want to appear that he needs it. We\u2019re going to continue to work at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is a \u2013 it\u2019s a real problem for Colombia and it has the potential to destabilize Colombia, which is why continuing to move forward on the peace implementation is so important, so it doesn\u2019t create a new area of instability and all the parties go back to their corners and we\u2019re right where we were.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have a lot of confidence in the Santos government, and we know they have elections coming up, but we believe the government is very committed to following through on implementing the peace accord. We need to encourage them and help where we can in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe problem with the coca production is \u2013 it\u2019s a significant problem. It\u2019s a problem to us, it\u2019s a shared problem. As I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t like to admit it, but we\u2019re the market. The United States accounts for the vast, vast, vast majority of illicit drug consumption in the world. And until we address that problem at home, it\u2019s a bit awkward to hold them solely accountable for being the supplier. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re working through these integrated dialogues to put the whole supply chain together. Let\u2019s own the consumption problem. We have to own that. They need to own the supply side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in Colombia we\u2019ve got a lot of issues to deal with, but we also think Colombia is an enormous country of opportunity, and they have everything they need to be wildly successful, and we believe they can be and they will be, and we just need to support them and encourage them to get on with implementing the peace accords.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for the question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. And then next question is from Alyson (ph), Alyson (inaudible). Yeah. The mike is going to you. Remember, please identify your degree program. Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Secretary Tillerson. Thanks so much for taking our questions. My name is Alyson Swadic (ph). I\u2019m a second-year master of public affairs student at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. My question is about the Merida Initiative, the security partnership between the U.S. and Mexico that you alluded to in your speech. You mentioned the importance of rule of law and fighting organized crime. Congress appropriated $2.8 billion to the Merida Initiative in 2008, but there\u2019s $1 billion left to spend. How do you think the U.S. should best spend that money in order to promote security for both nations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, in order to spend the money we also need the cooperation with the Mexican Government of where \u2013 where do they agree we can help them the most. So oftentimes the pace of that is coming to agreement with them on where they are willing, and we can work with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe continue to believe that we can provide them significant training in law enforcement because they need \u2013 they need more law enforcement personnel, training of people to build their forces up, and new kinds of training to deal with the cartels in particular. Regrettably, the cartels are \u2013 have become more powerful. They are extremely well armed. Most of those arms are coming from the United States. So we have a huge weapons interdiction effort underway as well. This is why we have Department of Homeland Security involved. Interestingly, for about every 10 trucks that we inspect coming north, because we\u2019re worried about what\u2019s coming to see us, we only inspect one truck going south. And so we have committed to them that we will do a better job of interdicting weapons flowing in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\u2019s \u2013 it is through this joint dialogue we\u2019re having with them to identify looking at what is \u2013 what are all elements of this supply chain? Where can we best attack that? What are the capabilities we need? And then we have some funds to address that. So it is going to be, I think, law enforcement, some ability to \u2013 for them to collect intelligence themselves on where these labs are. We destroyed, I think, about 134 labs last year through some information sharing, and when we identify them, the Mexican forces have been going in to destroy those. So I think we have a \u2013 or we\u2019ve got, unfortunately, too many opportunities where we can apply the joint effort, and we have the resources, the money, to do that. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Thanks. All right. All right. Another student question. Yeah, Evan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secretary Tillerson, thank you very much. My name is Evan McCormick. I\u2019m a post-doctoral fellow at the Clements Center. During the political crisis in Venezuela last year, the State Department vocally backed the Organization for American States\u2019 criticisms of the Venezuelan electoral system. In December, however, the State Department recognized the re-election of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez in spite similar \u2013 in spite of similar criticisms from the OAS regarding electoral irregularities and calling for or recommending a new election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy question is: What is the Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding support for free and fair democratic elections in the Americas, and will it work with the OAS in ensuring that those democratic standards are respected equally across the hemisphere?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, our position\u2019s the same in every country. And in the case of the Honduran elections, we also looked at other organizations\u2019 assessment of the election in terms of was it conducted in a free and fair way, was the election legitimate. In terms of why the OAS came to a different conclusion \u2013 which was actually different than the original conclusion they came to, they changed their position \u2013 I\u2019d refer you to the OAS to ask them. But we did look at the circumstances of the election. We concluded it was conducted fairly. And I think there\u2019s no \u2013 and I want to be clear here. There can be no comparison between the election process that was conducted in Honduras and the election process that\u2019s going on in Venezuela. They\u2019re nowhere close to one another. Thank you for the question, though.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right, okay. And one more student question. Let\u2019s do Abigail (ph). Right there, Diana (ph). Yeah, thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for spending part of your day with us. My name is Abigail Griffin and I am senior studying Plan II Honors government and Middle Eastern languages and cultures. I have a question regarding Venezuela. So a commonly proposed solution to a lot of the problems in the country is the removal of President Maduro from power. In your opinion, is this removal necessary, and what could the U.S.\u2019s role be in the possible regime change, especially considering the turmoil that could surmount from such a change?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, President Maduro could choose to just leave. I mean, that would \u2013 (laughter). That\u2019d be the easiest. We have not advocated for regime change or removal of President Maduro; rather, we have advocated that they return to the constitution. We do not recognize the constituent assembly as legitimate, and they need to get back to the constitution and follow the constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe \u2013 I think there will be a change. We want it to be a peaceful change. Peaceful transitions, peaceful regime change is always better than the alternative of violent change. In the history of Venezuela and in fact the history in other Latin American and South American countries, oftentimes it\u2019s the military that handles that, that when things are so bad that the military leadership realizes they just \u2013 they can\u2019t serve the citizens anymore, they will manage a peaceful transition. Whether that will be the case here or not, I do not know. Again, our position is Maduro should get back to his constitution and follow it. And then, if he is not re-elected by the people, so be it. And if the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s got some friends over in Cuba that can give him a nice hacienda on the beach, and he can have a nice life over there. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> All right. Well, our time is drawing to the close. I know the Secretary needs to head off on the next leg of his very ambitious journey here. But Mr. Secretary, one final question from the moderator here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a native Texan, you know here that here in Texas we have very strong concerns about border security, and I can \u2013 I think I can speak for almost everyone here in the room that when we look at our state\u2019s borders, especially SUT folks, our biggest concern is the threat from Oklahoma. (Laughter.) So especially the Sooners football team. So you\u2019ve got a captive audience. What advice do you have for Coach Herman, and what are we going to do to beat OU this fall? (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think I can help him. (Laughter.) We just need to get in place a visa program for the Red River \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and we just won\u2019t issue any visas to the Oklahoma football team. (Laughter and applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> I\u2019m really not worried. I\u2019m really not worried because University of Texas is going to beat Oklahoma this year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR INBODEN:</strong> There\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s headline. All right, okay. (Applause.) All right, okay. All right, all right. Everybody please join me in welcoming and thanking Secretary Tillerson. Thank you so much, sir. That was awesome. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd everybody, before you leave, we\u2019ve got a little sendoff for you from the Secretary\u2019s \u2013 the Secretary\u2019s old bandmates, his old friends. So stay with us for a couple minutes. Can\u2019t leave without a song. So that\u2019s right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(A song is performed.)

We are very glad to welcome them again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we are happy to have the opportunity to work in different topics that are important for our North American region. North America \u2013 we are convinced that it can be the most competitive region of the world in the next decades, and that\u2019s why we are working. We are working in a framework not only of neighborhood, but of friendship, of collaboration, and the sovereignty of the countries, knowing that together we can do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the conversations that we\u2019ve had today, of course, competitiveness is the core topic. How are we going to work together to generate more economic activities, more jobs for the inhabitants of this region? One of the topics of competitiveness where we can have an opportunity, an important opportunity, is the topic of energy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe North American region has the capabilities in human and the natural resources to be a very clean energy and cheap energy to be able to transform our societies and our economies. We have agreed to keep on working with the works of our secretaries, and we are also having the objective of getting to the regulations to generate the \u2013 and create the synergies where we can have a mutual construction of infrastructure, and of course, to enable the private sector, which is going to be able to create projects not only from hydrocarbons but also from the energy sector in clean energies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the commercial area, we see an important opportunity in the modernization of the Free Trade Agreement of North America, which is NAFTA. And this is going to be led by the corresponding areas of the government. We are making progress in a professional way, and from the Mexican Government we see a great opportunity to have a win-win-win situation \u2013 where Mexico wins, when Canada wins, and where the United States wins. We don\u2019t see it as a game where someone loses and someone wins. We want a modern agreement to be up to the situation of the 21st century. The North American Free Trade Agreement was agreed 25 years ago; it was a different world then. And now we have the opportunity to adapt it to the new reality, to have an agreement that is fair and that is reciprocal, to have trade based on rules, these rules that are going to allow this region to be \u2013 prosper and to keep generating jobs and welfare for the three parts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important part of the welfare of our region is the empowerment of women, entrepreneur women. And we agreed on working with them according to the mechanisms that are already established to have an agreement between the three countries. We had a meeting a few days ago of the empowerment of women in Mexico, and we are going to keep working on these important topics.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother important topic of the region is the \u2013 that is, the interest of the three countries is the safety. We identified as an important tool in the matter of drugs, and we have celebrated three meetings. We are going to hold the fourth meeting this year in Canada, and we agreed on having a special emphasis on the combat that we are having against the epidemic of opioids and fentanyl and heroin. This is generating a great damage of our citizens. In Mexico, it\u2019s taking the lives of lots of youngsters, and also in the United States and Canada due to the use of these substances.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we are going to continue working like last year with our United States Department to have a cooperation which is much more effective, knowing that we have a shared responsibility, and using the trilateral platform to exchange information and have the operational cooperation as well. We also talked about the efforts that we are doing jointly in the illegal human trafficking, which is a priority for the three parts, and we agreed on working on this topic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the meeting that we held trilaterally, we talked about important topics of our region, and I mean we are talking about three topics \u2013 the cooperation in Central America region. The initiative of Secretary Tillerson and John Kelly held a summit in Miami last year about the cooperation for Central America. Minister Freeland was there too, and we are working on knowing how are we going to work beyond the security issues, how are we going to contribute for the development, the economic development and the stability and the security of this place, especially from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. We agreed on working on what we are left to do, and we are going to take it as an important matter of our trilateral cooperation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also agreed on working with the cooperation initiatives in the Caribbean. This Caribbean region is strategic area which is going to face specific challenges. We are talking about the increase of the cooperation, our shared cooperation, to have a better resilience on the Caribbean islands against the natural phenomena which are derived from the climate change, and also strengthen the energy security in the Caribbean. We can do a lot of things. And each one of our governments have direct relationships with the Caribbean, but we need an effort between the United States, Canada, and Mexico in this matter, and it can be very effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd on third place, the situation of Venezuela. This is a very painful situation for our region and for our continent. We are facing the vision \u2013 one of the most important things that are at stake are the democratic system, and as part of this Inter-American Democratic Act, which is an instrument that is mandatory for the people of North America since 2001, while we cannot stay and do nothing with the situation of Venezuela. We have already confirmed our concern and our will to keep using the diplomatic tools that are at our hand to keep re-establishing the situation in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have shared with both ministers the role that Mexico played on the dialogue on the Venezuelan Government in Dominican Republic, and we decided to withdraw because there were no serious decisions made. But that does not mean that Mexico is going to keep having to stop having an active participation in Venezuela. The Venezuelan people are going to find the peaceful path, and Mexico is going to keep working with the rest of the countries of the region, of course, with the United States and Canada, to keep looking for a solution to this serious situation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese are one of the topics that we mentioned with Mexico, Canada, and the United States. This is a rich cooperation. It\u2019s a very diverse cooperation. And I would like to say that Mr. Tillerson and Mrs. Freeland my gratefulness to be here. It\u2019s very important for me and for Mexico to be here. It\u2019s not just an opportunity; it\u2019s a shared commitment. Thank you very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Now we are going to listen to Mrs. Chrystia Freeland, the ministry of Canada.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. To start, I would like to thank Secretary Videgaray and the rest of our hosts here in Mexico.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Interpreter speaks in Spanish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Via interpreter, in progress) ...Mexico, the United States, and Canada is going to face a lot of challenges. The representatives of our countries are going to be having different meetings, and we should remember that we are working together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(In English) Mexico, the United States, and Canada have long been partners, allies, neighbors, and most importantly friends. We are brought together not only by the physical fact of our shared geography, but by the equally important fact of our shared values.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe discussions we had today were very productive. Of course, we did touch on the NAFTA negotiations. From the very beginning, we in Canada have said that NAFTA must be updated and modernized to provide broader opportunity for the middle class and those working hard to join the middle class in all of our three countries. We are working hard for a deal that is innovative, forward-looking, and mutually beneficial for all three NAFTA partners. And here I will echo Secretary Videgaray and say we believe in a win-win-win outcome, and I am very hopeful that we can get there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of our discussion of North American competitiveness, we had an excellent conversation about energy collaboration, and I am hopeful that\u2019s something that we can carry forward from this meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also spoke about the importance of advancing democracy in the hemisphere, most notably in Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis continues to worsen. The Maduro regime is systematically violating the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people. We three agreed that we must do everything we can to restore democracy and relieve the unacceptable suffering of the people of Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also spoke about how we can cooperate to fight transnational crime, in particular the opioid crisis, which is causing such devastating harm to the people of Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, we spoke about our shared commitment to the empowerment of women and girls and discussed ways we can advance that agenda together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s always a pleasure for Canada to work with our continental partners and neighbors with whom we share so many values and interests on issues of mutual trilateral and also global concern. It\u2019s great to spend time with you, Rex, Secretary Tillerson, and thank you again, Luis, Secretary Videgaray, for hosting this great conversation. <em>Muchas gracias, amigos</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> And now we\u2019re going to thank Mr. Rex Tillerson for his message.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, first let me thank Foreign Secretary Videgaray for hosting today\u2019s trilateral, and thank Foreign Minister Freeland for making the trip down to Mexico City. In 2017, my very first bilateral visit as Secretary of State was to Mexico City, and about this time a year ago we were standing here holding a press conference. As it turns out, my very last trip of 2017 as Secretary of State was to Ottawa. So it\u2019s right that we should meet at this time in the trilateral relationship. And we meet \u2013 even when we\u2019re not meeting, I would share with you that the three of us are in very frequent contact on all issues that are of importance to our countries, on security, as well as economic prosperity, because our three countries are connected. When we can work together, and when we are unified in our positions and our voice, we have significant influence on the events not just in our hemisphere, but elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today we discussed a range of trilateral, regional, and global issues, and I cannot emphasize enough the importance of our economic relationships. Canada and Mexico rank as the first or second-largest export market for 42 U.S. states and support nearly 3 million U.S. jobs. North America is also a major player, as Secretary Videgaray highlighted, in the energy markets. And we discussed what we believe are really unique opportunities to promote market-based energy development and to further energy integration throughout North America and the hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also talked and discussed following through on the 2016 trilateral MOU to economically empower women that Foreign Minister Freeland mentioned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBeyond our trade and economic relationships, we also discussed mutual areas of serious concern, in particular the most immediate threat to our hemisphere from transnational criminal organizations. We continue to employ a coordinated and multilateral approach to diminish the influence of these groups and rid our hemisphere of the violence and devastation they promote. In June of last year, Canada joined the United States and Mexico for a conference on prosperity and security in Central America. At that meeting, we secured commitments from international partners and in the private sector to address a range of issues facing the Northern Triangle governments, including economic, energy, security, and governance challenges. Today, we discussed on how we can follow up on those commitments from that conference. Success there will better protect all of our countries and provide opportunities for the citizens of Central America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGiven the deadly nature of the opioid crisis, we must do more to attack the business models of those who traffic drugs and guns. That was a major theme of the second strategic dialogue that I cohosted with Foreign Secretary Videgaray last December in Washington, D.C. Through our targeted dialogues like this and the North American Drug Dialogue, we are developing and deploying new strategies to disrupt and dismantle these deadly networks that smuggle drugs, that participate in human trafficking and other illicit activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTurning elsewhere in the hemisphere, we shared our concerns for the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in Venezuela. We all urge the Maduro regime to return to free, open, credible, democratic elections and to allow the Venezuelans a voice in their government. Our three countries will work with all members of the Lima Group to assist the Venezuelan people during this time of crisis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also expressed to Foreign Minister Freeland and Foreign Secretary Videgaray how I \u2013 how strongly I support Peru\u2019s ambitious anticorruption agenda for the Summit of the Americas later this spring. We hope leaders throughout the hemisphere will make concrete commitments to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and support economic growth and job creation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs challenges become more complex, North America and our three countries will continue to work together to find solutions. That makes meetings like we\u2019ve had today extremely valuable, and it was certainly useful to me and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with my counterparts. And thank you again for hosting, Luis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Secretary Tillerson. Now we\u2019re going to have a question and answer session. We\u2019re going to have one question per each one of the participant countries. We\u2019re going to start with Mexico. Jorge Ramos from Grupo Imagen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. I\u2019m on your right, and my partners and I would like to know about the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and the Chancellor Videgaray and Mr. Tillerson, because they talked about the agreement for the Dreamers and the immigrants. Do you have the DACA agreement for the United States for the construction of the border wall? And have you talked about the agreement to fight against the criminal groups that are in both sides of the border, and also to stop the flow of weapons from the United States to Mexico? This is the first part.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second part is we would also like to know that \u2013 if in the agreement to try to go back to the normality in Venezuela, is there a military offensive from the United States to combat Maduro\u2019s situation, and is it going to be supported by Mexico and Canada?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd just a question for Mr. Tillerson: Is there evidence that there is going to be an interference in the Russian Government in Mexico as there was in the United States? I mean the elections of your country. And are you going to reiterate the situation that Canada and Mexico should not have a close relationship to Russia and China?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, I would like to know if there is an agreement between Mexico and the United States about the possibility of deploying guards in the transborder flights to answer to any issue that might arise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> (Via interpreter) We\u2019re going to establish a rule: If you\u2019re going to ask more than three, I\u2019m just going to answer three, all right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe didn\u2019t talk about the DACA agreement. We have talked about it before, but in the migration situation, it is a matter of the United States to agree on this, and it\u2019s the same thing in Mexico and Canada. And in the case of the DACA, of course we have shared information with members of the American Congress and \u2013 congressmen of the United States, but if the DACA people are coming back, it would be a win situation for Mexico and a lose situation for the United States. It would be one of the most important losses in humanity, because this is a situation of people who came as children and they have a clean record, most of them, and are engineers. They work in programming, they are doctors, lawyers, and of course, Mexico would be having an important win situation and lose situation for the United States. But finally, that is the decision from the United States and we are going to try to find a situation in the Congress for the future of these young people. But at the end, it\u2019s what they decide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ve talked to most of them, and most of them want to stay in the United States. Most of them want to stay there and some of them want to come back to Mexico, but it \u2013 this is not a matter of the bilateral situation. We also talked widely about this situation in this meeting, and Mr. Rex Tillerson was talking about it in \u2013 a few moments ago about the combat of the criminal groups is one of our priorities. And we want these efforts to have a more strategic planning so that we can dismantle the plans of these organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe mentioned it last year and we hope that we can have measurable results. One of the topics that we\u2019re going to mention in the dismantling of these criminal groups is going to be weapons. Of course, the illegal weapons that come from the United States to Mexico is something that should be dismantled. And we have an agreement of what the paradigm is. This paradigm should be cooperation. We should not take the guilt into someone else. The criminal groups that \u2013 and the illegal weapons from the United States, Mexico, and the cash that comes is to be able to dismantle the production and the creation of these groups. If we don\u2019t have a joint effort, we are giving a strategic opportunity to these criminal groups, and we\u2019re not going to be able to dismantle them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson is going to talk about the specific question about Venezuela, and I would like to say that Mexico is not going to support the decision that involves violence, either internal or external, for the case of Venezuela. And about the question of the special agents in the United \u2013 for the United States in trans-border flights, well, it is a proposal that has not been done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there are lots of proposals in terms of security. We are analyzing all these proposals and the operative proposals, but there is not an agreement yet. There is a conversation that is going to be taken seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Okay. So there were several questions in there. We\u2019ll see if I can remember them all. First, with respect to DACA, President Trump has put forward a proposal to the Congress that I think addresses in a very, very important way how people should be treated and the value of those people. And his proposal would remove the uncertainty for more than a million people that find themselves in this situation. And the President\u2019s been quite clear that he wants to see this solved, and he\u2019s called upon the Congress to solve it. So I think it is certainly his commitment to see this issue resolved once and for all, and provide clarity, which is so important, so that people know how to plan their lives going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the commitment to disrupt the transcriminal organizations, as I mentioned in my remarks, we created early last year \u2013 in fact, it was in this first trip that I made to Mexico City, the first bilat \u2013 a different approach as to how we cooperate to attack the entire supply chain of this devastating impact of drugs \u2013 cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, opioids. This is having a horrible effect on American citizens, Mexican citizens, Canadian citizens. And so throughout the year we have had two major follow-up meetings in Washington, D.C. We had a very important working dinner last night with the Mexican military counterparts and the navy and the Mexican army and Mexican intelligence service to discuss how we feel about the progress and what are the areas that need more attention. So this is a joint effort that is very, very active, it is very robust, and we intend to maintain this effort well in until we have resolved this problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou asked about Russian interference in Mexican elections. All I could say to you is we know that Russia has fingerprints in a number of elections around the world. We hear this from our European counterparts as well. My advice would be \u2013 to Mexico would be: Pay attention. Pay attention to what\u2019s happening.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of air marshals on flights, we have air marshals on a number of flights in the United States. It\u2019s about creating security for both the arrivals and the destinations. And any action that would be taken regarding flights with Mexico will be done in full cooperation and coordination with Mexican authorities as well, all with a view that we want to provide greater security for all of our passengers that are traveling back and forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to Venezuela and what we would like to see happen there is a peaceful transition, if \u2013 if President Maduro would return to the Venezuelan constitution, restore the duly elected assembly, dismantle the illegitimate constituent assembly, and return to free, fair elections, then he\u2019s happy to stay and run in a free and fair election. If he wants to step aside and let someone else follow through on that, that\u2019s fine, but our view is you must return to the constitution, and that\u2019s what we hope Venezuela ultimately will do. That\u2019s what we all are working hard to see them do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t know if I hit all your questions. Those are the ones I could remember.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> Good enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Now our next question, Pilar.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Good afternoon. My question is to Minister Freeland. According to the free trade agreement, the negotiation with the United States had several agreements on the United States. Would you give us an opinion about this? What is going to happen with Mexico and the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we also like to know about the renegotiation period. What are the risks that we are going to have in Mexico in the change of governments for Canada and for the United States? And we also like to know about their recent topics of the situation and told with the Minister Luis Videgaray.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> As far as NAFTA goes, as actually all three of us said, all three countries are strong believers in North American competitiveness, and we really believe that this agreement, which has now been in place for almost a quarter century, has made our continent more competitive. It has created jobs and growth in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The world has changed a lot, though, since we first negotiated NAFTA, and to give you an example, on the tracing list for cars in NAFTA today, we have cassette decks \u2013 which my children don\u2019t even know what a cassette deck is \u2013 but we don\u2019t have rear view cameras.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is time to update this agreement, to modernize it, to make it fit for the 21st century, to make it more effective for all three countries, and that is what Canada is 100 percent committed to doing. We believe that that is absolutely possible, and we are working hard with a lot of goodwill.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of timelines, we would love to get this deal done as quickly as possible. Uncertainty is never good for business confidence. Having said that, it\u2019s a really complicated agreement, and we believe in taking the time it takes to get it right. So I think all of us are going to be working really, really hard to get it done as quickly as possible to get a good outcome for all three of our countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Tracy Wilkinson from the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> For Secretary Tillerson, you spoke yesterday in Austin quite eloquently, really, about the shared values of the United States with Latin America, the need to strengthen those partnerships, to build the rule of law and democratic institutions, and you also spoke, really, of the benefits of immigration. Our \u2013 all the passports of different colors that we have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDoes it undercut your message here and your efforts or mission to build on those relationships when a very different message comes from your own President, who, for example, in his State of the Union, described \u2013 painted a picture of immigration from Mexico as a cause of crime, or even today was attacking this morning the FBI and some of the very pillars of rule of law and democracy? Does that make your mission more difficult? Which \u2013 and which version should Americans believe, which version should Mexicans believe?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, for the Ministers Videgaray and Freeland, how difficult is it for you to negotiate with a government that speaks in such different voices? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think with respect to U.S. immigration policy, what the President, I think, has observed is that over the years, our immigration system has grown so many arms and legs, if you just look at the number of different programs by which people come to the United States, that oftentimes we don\u2019t have real good discipline around how those programs are enforced consistent with the laws. And in fact, as the President requested early in his term that a full review be undertaken of all the immigration policies, what we found is there were a lot of exceptions to the intent of Congress \u2013 had been put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the first thing the President has done is said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to enforce the laws.\u201d The Congress passed the laws, the executive is required to enforce the laws, and we intend to enforce them to the letter of the law. And so that\u2019s really where this whole process begins. So what we want is legal immigration, legal immigration where we understand who is entering the country, and why are they entering the country and are they coming to enjoy a nice vacation; are they coming to work here for some time; are they coming here for education or are they coming here to work; are they coming here to one day hoping to become citizens?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we really \u2013 what the President has asked is: Let\u2019s put in place systems. And that\u2019s where a lot of the new, in particular, immigration from countries that are very unstable today, that don\u2019t have strong governments themselves in parts of the world. Let\u2019s make sure we have systems in place where we understand who is coming to the United States of America, and as he indicated, we are a nation built by immigrants. All of us can trace our ancestry, or most of us can, back to someone in the family that immigrated to the United States. And we still value immigrants, and they bring enormous value to our continent. And that\u2019s what the President, though, is asking is, I want to know how this person who wants to come and live in our country is going to bring value to our country. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 fundamentally, that\u2019s what he is pursuing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd it is very complicated, because we have over the years put so many different mechanisms in place, I think well-intended, to deal with situations around the world, many of which \u2013 those situations no longer exist. And we\u2019ve never gone back and kind of cleaned this up, and gotten back to where \u2013 what was the original intent. So I know it\u2019s painful, the process is, for a lot of people, and that\u2019s why, as we move forward in implementing the President\u2019s directives, we\u2019re trying to do that in a way that accommodates the fact that this is hard for some people. How can we give them time to adjust? What can we do to fix a lot of this back in Congress?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that\u2019s why the President has been pressing Congress for a number of actions to make changes to the immigration law, to fix these defects that have risen over the years and crept into the immigration system. He wants this to be a country that\u2019s \u2013 that follows the law, and he wants us to enforce the law, and when it\u2019s not working, we should go to the Congress and say, \u201cLook, we need you to fix this part of the immigration law, whether it\u2019s on a particular program to deal with refugees or whether it\u2019s other issues like DACA, let\u2019s fix it.\u201d And instead, we\u2019ve had a long period of time where people have kind of issued a directive here and an order there, and things have kind of gotten out of \u2013 have gotten out of the normal order.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo my message \u2013 that would be my message to people trying to understand what the President\u2019s doing with immigration is let\u2019s have it very clear what the rules are. Let\u2019s enforce those rules, and then people that desire to come to the United States know exactly what the pathway is to get here, and they will have certainty when they arrive. Because we have so many people living in the country today that immigrated, and they\u2019re living under a huge cloud of uncertainty. And the President would like to remove that uncertainty for a lot of people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY:</strong> Since the question was in English, I\u2019ll answer in English. Mexico will always be prepared to deal with, to work with any administration in the U.S. or in any other country around the world. And we do so because we are a sovereign nation, and we have clarity about our principles, about our objectives and the things we are willing to do and the things we are not willing to do. With the Trump administration, we\u2019ve committed to have a very close communication, and that has proven to be a tremendous benefit for the relationship. I think that in many ways, the relationship today is more fluid, it\u2019s closer than it was with previous administrations, which might be surprising to some people, but that\u2019s a fact of life.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I want to highlight the role that \u2013 and leadership of Secretary Tillerson, who has been instrumental to achieving this, and to bring our countries closer. Yes, we do have some differences, as every other country does, but we\u2019ve been working very closely, we\u2019ve achieved substantial things, and we\u2019re looking into the future. This is a relationship about opportunities and about the things that we can do together, and we\u2019re working well, we\u2019re working close, and we are about results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND:</strong> Yeah, and so \u2013 I think the Canadian view is very similar. Canada has been negotiating with the United States for as long as we have been a country. We feel we know you guys pretty well. In fact, we probably spend a lot more time thinking about you than you spend thinking about us. We\u2019re okay with that. When it comes to the current administration, the President\u2019s counterpart is of course my prime minister, and I\u2019ve been with my prime minister at a number of bilateral meetings. And I know that the two leaders have a very strong mutual respect for one another, and I would say, they also really get along. As for my U.S. counterparts, Luis and I are going to embarrass you, Rex, but it is a true pleasure working with Secretary Tillerson.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHe is a tremendous friend and partner for Canada, and an incredibly important voice in maintaining the rules-based international order, and it\u2019s been a real privilege for me to work with him on issues ranging from peace and security on the North Korean Peninsula \u2013 we recently cohosted a summit in Vancouver on this issue. He was brave enough to come to Ottawa in December; that shows true friendship. And I am grateful both to Secretary Tillerson and to Secretary Videgaray that we three continental partners were able to have a really good meeting here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: </strong><em>Muchas gracias a todo</em>.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

The United States stands in solidarity with governments and communities around the world working to end this human rights abuse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAccording to UNICEF, at least 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone some form of FGM/C. If current trends continue, an additional fifteen million girls are at risk of being subjected to the practice by 2030. Although it is illegal in most countries, FGM/C is often performed in communities where the value and status of women and girls lags behind that of men and boys.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States partners with a broad range of stakeholders\u2014from policymakers and health practitioners to religious leaders and youth activists\u2014to work against FGM/C and to raise awareness of the harm it causes to societies. U.S. Department of State officials continue to engage diplomatically with host governments and through bilateral and multilateral partners to end this practice. In 2017, the Department contributed $5,000,000 to UN efforts combatting FGM/C, and its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices include country-by-country information on the prevalence of the practice and international efforts taken to combat it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBuilding on investments made in previous years to address the problem, we continue to advance initiatives to support survivor-centered programs in countries where FGM/C is most prevalent.

This fiscal year, USAID is launching a three-year pilot activity in Kenya aimed at combatting FGM/C and child marriage by tackling the root causes and social motivators that drive these practices, including women\u2019s lack of agency, unresponsive health services, inactive protection networks, and limited economic opportunities for women and girls.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe advancement of women and girls is essential to peace, prosperity, and security.

You may be seated. Thank you so much for joining us, everyone, on this working visit of the U.S. Secretary of State to Jamaica. The Prime Minister will make some remarks, followed by Secretary Tillerson.\n\n\n<p>\n\tPrime Minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Members of the media, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It was my great pleasure to welcome Secretary of State Tillerson to Jamaica and to host him and his delegation on this brief but historic working visit to Jamaica. Secretary Tillerson and I have engaged in critical discussions on issues of mutual interest to Jamaica and the United States, as well as the region, with a focus on promoting a peaceful, prosperous, energy-secure, and democratic hemisphere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmong the specific matters discussed were strengthening security cooperation in order to more effectively combat transnational organized crime; boosting the U.S.-Jamaica economic partnership; exploring opportunities to broaden U.S.-CARICOM engagement; energy security; the economic vulnerability of middle-income countries, including climatic events; de-risking and correspondent banking issues; and of course, the situation in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur talks reflected Jamaica\u2019s long and productive relationship with the United States and signaled the importance of the strong and vibrant partnership that exists between our two countries. I highlighted the common values we share based on our geographic proximity, our strong historical and cultural ties, our robust trade, tourism and investment relations, our large Jamaican diaspora in the USA, and our strong record of people-to-people contacts at all levels.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI expressed gratitude on behalf of the government and people of Jamaica for the high levels of support provided by the United States to Jamaica over the years, especially in the areas which have assisted in meeting our national development goals. In particular, we have greatly valued America\u2019s efforts to disrupt transnational crime through continued support to effectively secure Jamaica\u2019s maritime space. We agreed to deepen our cooperation in this regard, acknowledging also that the sharing and exchange of intelligence is critical to safely \u2013 is critical to the safety and security of our two countries and the wider region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to our economic partnership, Secretary Tillerson and I both agreed that the transformation of Jamaica\u2019s energy sector is critical to the achievement of our development objectives, including resilience. I expressed the hope that the U.S. will continue to support our thrust towards energy independence in the region, including greater efficiency in energy use and greater in cooperation of renewable energy sources. I expressed the hope that the United States will strengthen its economic partnerships and participation in the region in the interests of our respective countries and peoples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, we used the opportunity to discuss diaspora matters and the invaluable contribution of Jamaicans resident in the United States, including those engaged in service sectors of critical importance to the United States economy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson reiterated the concern of the U.S. Government on the political and economic crisis in Venezuela and the impact on the most vulnerable. We both agreed that positive engagement between the government and the opposition in Venezuela is essential, and expressed regret that the attempts of the OAS to promote dialogue have not been met with success. At the conclusion of our meeting, we agreed that the Government of Venezuela must act in the best interest of its people and that it should ensure that the presidential elections are free, fair, and credible in the eyes of the Venezuelan people and the international community.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, I thank you for visiting Jamaica today, as we work towards a shared vision of peaceful, prosperous, energy-secure, and a democratic hemisphere. I thank you for the frank and candid dialogue and the spirit of cooperation which have made our talks constructive and fruitful. I look forward to continuing the vibrant partnership enjoyed between Jamaica and the United States in the years ahead. I thank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, first, let me begin by thanking the prime minister for a very warm welcome to Jamaica and for the hospitality shown to myself and my delegation. This is indeed my first visit to Jamaica, although I shared with him some of my family members have been here. I think they have more vacation days than I do. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut indeed, it really is a pleasure to be here and, as the prime minister indicated, have a very, very far-reaching, comprehensive discussion and exchange on important issues to both of our countries, but also to take note of the strong record of cooperation that exists between the United States and Jamaica. And as most of you know, this is the concluding stop on a trip that I\u2019ve taken throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, and this stop I think is important because Jamaica is our closest partner in this region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States understands the importance of \u2013 that our security and prosperity are very closely tied to that of our Caribbean neighbors, and we\u2019re glad to have the partner we have in Jamaica. And I noted that the prime minister is assuming the chairmanship of CARICOM, and so I think it made our discussions even that much more timely and useful. Because we did speak about the region more broadly, as well, beyond just Jamaica and the U.S. relations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe did talk about several aspects of the U.S.-Jamaica bilateral relationship, and our view is of the outsized role that Jamaica does play in the region as a leader to other countries here in the Caribbean Basin. Through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, the United States and the Caribbean have really taken great strides in unifying our approach to regional security, but we discussed ways in which we could take that further and do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the Jamaican Government\u2019s commitment to countering narcotics trafficking and transnational criminal organizations and the cooperation that we already enjoy, but we also see many, many opportunities to enhance that cooperation to be even more effective in disrupting these illegal organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe appreciate the Government of Jamaica has made important progress combatting the lotto scams, cooperating closely with U.S. authorities to extradite suspected lotto scammers to the United States and establishing a bilateral lotto scam task force, and we welcome that. The U.S. Government will continue to support Jamaica\u2019s security forces and criminal justice system. It is in both of our countries\u2019 interests to work together to investigate crimes, share intelligence, conduct asset seizures where legally and appropriate to do so, and bolster existing anti-corruption and anti-gang programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to our focus on regional security, as the prime minister indicated, we had a very comprehensive discussion on ways to promote increased energy independence not just for Jamaica, but throughout the Caribbean. And we stand ready to assist with Jamaica and other partners in the Caribbean to explore and develop the resources they have, but also to share the abundance of resources that North America enjoys and the continent enjoys. Jamaica is developing new wind, solar, and gas \u2013 natural gas capabilities, all of which are going to serve the Jamaican people better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, as mentioned to the prime minister and Minister Johnson Smith, the United States appreciates Jamaica adding its voice to the major issues affecting our region, and the prime minister just spoke very eloquently about the concern we all share regarding the situation in Venezuela. Jamaica\u2019s votes in the OAS to achieve stability, prosperity, and support democracy in Venezuela have demonstrated exceptional support to the human rights issues that confront us in the Western Hemisphere. We will continue to ask our partners to support the people of Venezuela during this very trying time for them, and we will continue \u2013 the United States will \u2013 to put pressure on the Maduro regime to return its country to free, open, and democratic elections. The people of Venezuela deserve this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo today, we\u2019ll continue to work hand in hand to advance regional security cooperation, build economic partnerships. We have so much more to do together, and thank you again, Prime Minister, for the very warm welcome. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you so much, Secretary Tillerson, and Prime Minister. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll open the floor for some questions. Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson, we have members of the overseas traveling media as well as our local media entities here with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI have \u2013 again, the rules, you raise your hand, I\u2019ll identify you, and then when you \u2013 the microphone is brought to you, could you please identify yourself, your media entity, and ask succinctly your question to the leaders? I see a hand over there, if we could get the microphone that side, please. Ms. Chisholm, in the back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, good afternoon. Andrea Chisholm from Television Jamaica. Secretary Tillerson, at the United Nations prior to the vote on Jerusalem, the U.S. ambassador to the UN said that we are watching, and many saw that as a threat to small and developing countries. Then there are some who classify Haiti, one of our CARICOM partners, as \u201cblank-hole\u201d countries. How should we perceive your visit today and how can Caribbean countries think that you respect us and it\u2019s not more of the United States just throwing their power around?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I\u2019m here to reinforce the partnership and how we view the partnerships with Jamaica, but also with the entire Caribbean region, as I just indicated in my remarks. This is an important region to us. As we discussed today, this is the United States\u2019 third border, and Jamaica has the largest stretch of that third border with the United States \u2013 very important to our national security but also important to future economic opportunity as well. So the U.S. sees many, many opportunities for furthering our cooperation on trade, for strengthening our security cooperation, and most particularly, for combating these transnational criminal organizations that bring nothing but problems and violence and devastation to Jamaica and the region, but also certainly to the homeland for the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we seek to strengthen this \u2013 our partnerships in the region, and we see many, many opportunities to do so, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re really excited about the prime minister assuming chairmanship of CARICOM and it\u2019s why \u2013 one of the reasons why I really wanted to meet with him today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Secretary Tillerson. I recognize CBS. I believe you had a hand up. Could you identify yourself formally, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, hi, Kylie Atwood with CBS News. Thank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister, I have a question for you first. The U.S. is continuing to look for ways to build up opposition and to economically isolate the Maduro regime in Venezuela. You\u2019ve stated that you support the U.S. in those efforts today, but is Jamaica willing and able to stop importing Venezuelan oil?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Secretary Tillerson, a question for you: How would the U.S. be able to support the Caribbean and Jamaica specifically if you\u2019re asking them to cut down on the amount of oil that they\u2019re importing from Jamaica? Could the U.S. provide any subsidized oil to Jamaica and these other countries? What are you thinking about as possibilities? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Jamaica supports human rights, Jamaica supports peace in this region, and Jamaica wants to see the people of Venezuela being able to enjoy their democracy. This is a principle that has nothing to do with any other country. This has always been Jamaica\u2019s position. We wish the best for the people of Venezuela. We now don\u2019t hardly import oil from Venezuela. With the new dynamics in the global trade and energy and with the United States now becoming a net exporter of energy resources, Jamaica can, in this new paradigm, benefit from that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Secretary?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as the prime minister, I think, made the point in his remarks, this is one of the things that binds Jamaica and the U.S. so closely, is strong commitment to democratic values. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re just both heartbroken to see what\u2019s happening in Venezuela, as we\u2019re seeing what was once a thriving democracy dismantled before our very eyes. It\u2019s the reason we intend to take all actions possible to persuade the regime to return to its full constitutional authorities, return it to the hands of the Venezuelan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs to any future steps that the U.S. might take regarding sanctioning oil or products to put more pressure on the Maduro regime, we are going to take into full consideration the impacts on regional countries as well. And we had a good exchange today regarding that issue not just for Jamaica, but also getting the prime minister\u2019s perspective on other countries, how they might be affected. And we will be looking at what are actions the U.S. might take to mitigate the negative impacts of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t want to get into specifics because we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to undertake a very quick study to see: Are there some things that the U.S. could easily do with our rich energy endowment, with the infrastructure that we already have available \u2013 what could we do to perhaps soften any impact of that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, I think there is \u2013 there\u2019s great unanimity in the region and certainly in the hemisphere that we all want to see some progress on this situation in Venezuela, which only gets worse day by day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Secretary Tillerson and Prime Minister. I recognize at the back Mr. Campbell.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Edmond Campbell, Gleaner Company. Good afternoon, Secretary of State and Prime Minister Holness. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in December of last year rejecting the American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. But prior to that vote, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, she warned countries not \u2013 well, to vote with the U.S., or not to vote against the U.S., or the U.S. might be withdrawing aid from such countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, is that a policy position of the U.S.?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Prime Minister Holness, could you just explain to us specifically why it is that Jamaica sat on the fence in that particular vote? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think President Trump actually addressed this in his State of the Union speech the other night when he said we need to undertake a re-examination of how the United States provides aid around the world globally, and not just for this particular issue, but more broadly in terms of: As we provide significant assistance to countries, are these countries that align with our values? Are they countries that align with what we believe are ways to make the world a safer and more prosperous place?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think it\u2019s in that context that I would answer your question, as it\u2019s not been examined in quite some time, if ever, in terms of: How does the United States want to think about the generosity of the American people, because this is the American people\u2019s money that\u2019s being provided to others, and what should the expectation be around \u2013 what are we supporting?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so as the President stated in his State of the Union address, he\u2019s asked that we consider that question. There has been no new policy adopted at this point, but he\u2019s asked us to think about all of our elements of our aid programs, and are they really advancing and promoting the values that the American people want to see advanced.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Edmond, Jamaica was one of several countries in the Caribbean region that abstained. From our perspective, from a diplomatic perspective, Jamaica did not need to take a position on another country\u2019s position on where they would want to see as a capital in the world. So from our perspective, this was not an issue that Jamaica should take a position on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd generally speaking, Jamaica conducts its foreign policy on principle. We are not conducting foreign policy for aid or for special benefits. So I want to make that position very clear to the Jamaican people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you, Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson. And given our time issue, let\u2019s take a final question. The gentleman with the beard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Oh, another question. I thought we were done. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello, Mr. Secretary, the gentleman with the beard. (Laughter.) I am Dave Clark from Agence France-Presse. The question\u2019s actually for Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. Prime Minister, when we were with the Secretary in Mexico last week, Foreign Minister Videgaray said that if America went ahead and expelled more than a million so-called Dreamers, that this would be a win for Mexico, a massive injection of human capital, and a loss for the United States, because they\u2019d be losing a lot of valuable workers. You yourself have just spoken about the large Jamaican diaspora in the United States. From your perspective, if the United States were to halt or reverse immigration from Jamaica and the Caribbean, would that be a loss for the United States or would that be a loss for Jamaica? And how do you feel when the President of the United States is reported as saying he would prefer immigrants from Norway? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong> Well, you raise a very interesting question. We, in Jamaica, have struggled with the reverse of immigration, which is the loss of tremendous talent and human resource, much of which we pay for. We call it the brain drain. At the same time, the Government of Jamaica would not want to see people deprived of their dreams and aspirations and ambitions. But from a government perspective, we are a practical government. And as we look on as to what another independent country would do with their internal foreign policy, we stand ready to welcome all our Jamaicans, and we want our diaspora to continue to support and participate in Jamaica.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou mentioned an important thing, Secretary Tillerson. You say, America the homeland. Jamaica is the homeland for Jamaicans, and we would want to have their skills and their resources here. And we support them as well in their dreams to settle and work in other countries, and we encourage them to abide by the laws and institutions of that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong></span><span><span> Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister and Secretary Tillerson.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

These officials will be known now as Senior Department Officials One, Two, Three, Four, and Five respectively. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is on background and will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. With that, I\u2019m happy to now turn it over to our first speaker who will begin \u2013 who will brief us on the Secretary\u2019s travel to Amman. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Hi, folks. Senior Department Official One here with you. So as you know, part of the visit to \u2013 on this trip is going to involve a trip to Amman, Jordan. It\u2019s something that Secretary Tillerson had been planning on doing for quite a long time. When he\u2019s there he\u2019ll meet, obviously, with King Abdullah and with Foreign Minister Safadi. He\u2019ll pay a visit to the U.S. embassy, including a new annex that will be reopened there \u2013 that will be opened there soon. And he\u2019ll do a visit with the U.S. embassy staff, one of our largest teams in the Middle East. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the purpose of the visit, and recall that this visit comes on the heels of a very successful visit by Vice President Pence only a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s really a marker of the longstanding and enduring strength of our U.S.-Jordan partnership. At the center of the visit is going to be conclusion \u2013 Secretary Tillerson and his counterpart Foreign Minister Safadi \u2013 conclusion of a bilateral MOU that enshrines our commitment to cooperate on a whole range of bilateral assistance priorities \u2013 economic, defense, security \u2013 over the coming years. The details of that MOU we will leave for the actual signing when the team is in Jordan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the visit of the Secretary to Jordan will highlight our cooperation with the Jordanians on a whole range of issues \u2013 their work with us resolving the conflict in Syria, the defeat of ISIS and other terrorist groups, and our work \u2013 continuing work to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, including Israeli-Palestinian peace. Obviously, the Secretary will convey our assistance and understanding and support for Jordan as they host upwards of 650,000 refugees, and our commitment to supporting Jordan\u2019s efforts to manage the refugee influx while implementing reforms designed to stimulate Jordan\u2019s economy, promote private sector-led growth, and renewable energy in Jordan.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Now we\u2019ll take a preview of the trip to Ankara.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> So Secretary Tillerson\u2019s visit to Ankara is the next step in a series of high-level telephone and in-person engagements we\u2019ve had with senior Turkish leadership, the purpose of which is really to reaffirm the value of our alliance with Turkey and the shared interests that we face as we try and work through a range of these challenges together. The Secretary obviously plans to raise some of the more difficult issues in the bilateral relationship as well as some of the things that are going better. And then he\u2019ll also, of course, discuss the full range of regional and security issues, from the defeat ISIS campaign to counter PKK and so forth. We don\u2019t have a full, final schedule yet in terms of who the Secretary will meet exactly when, but he will be meeting with senior level Turkish officials and have some internal meetings at the embassy as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right, thank you very much. And now we\u2019ll go back to Senior Department Official Number One to preview Beirut.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> So again, as part of the visit, the Secretary\u2019s going to visit Beirut. This is the first time a Secretary of State has been to Beirut in four years. And obviously, the center of that visit, he\u2019ll meet with President Aoun, with Prime Minister Saad Hariri, and with the speaker of the parliament, Nabih Berri. It\u2019s really an opportunity to affirm our support for Lebanon as it confronts a whole range of challenges \u2013 defending its borders from terrorists, coping with extraordinary influx of refugees, upwards of a million refugees since the start of the Syrian war. And the visit will also underscore our commitment to Lebanese national institutions, principally the Lebanese Armed Forces and internal security forces in Lebanon, as those forces fight ISIS, al-Qaida, and maintain Lebanon\u2019s stability.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>He\u2019ll obviously also raise the question \u2013 the issue of Hizballah, the destructive role that Hizballah plays in Lebanon and across the region. It\u2019s obviously unacceptable that a militia like Hizballah continues to operate outside the authority of the Lebanese state, and that will be a major topic of discussion between him and Lebanon\u2019s leaders. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And now we\u2019ll take a preview of Cairo.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> So Egypt\u2019s a key strategic partner for us in the region, and the Secretary\u2019s visit to Cairo is an opportunity for him to further build upon the strengthening of the relationship that has occurred over the past year in the array of senior level engagement that there has been \u2013 most recently the Vice President\u2019s visit just a few weeks ago.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Secretary will meet with Egyptian President al-Sisi, his counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, and he\u2019ll also visit the U.S. embassy and meet with U.S. embassy staff.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Building on the Vice President\u2019s recent, very successful visit to Cairo, the Secretary will discuss a range of issues with the Egyptians, including regional issues of mutual concern such as Libya and Syria, our shared commitment to fighting terrorism, Israeli-Palestinian issues and our efforts to move the prospects for peace forward, and other topics pertaining to the bilateral relationship and how it can be further strengthened.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And now, finally, a look at Kuwait.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOUR:</strong> The Secretary will visit Kuwait, and his visit there really has four key components. There is a \u2013 as you know, global conference on defeating ISIL that will take place. There is an Iraq reconstruction event that he will participate in. He will have bilateral meetings with the Kuwaiti relationship, and he will have a number of separate bilateral meetings with other non-Kuwaiti leaders who are also in the country for those two events that I mentioned at the top.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>It\u2019s no coincidence that the Secretary will have these types of engagements in Kuwait. Kuwait\u2019s a very strong and steady regional partner; hosts the fourth-largest number of U.S. troops anywhere in the world; has been a strong partner in the counter-ISIL coalition, and is also a leader on humanitarian issues in the region, as evidenced by its strong support for Syrian refugees and other humanitarian events. Kuwait\u2019s also been the mediator of the Gulf crisis, or the Qatar dispute, as it is sometimes called. And when the Secretary is in Kuwait and in his meetings with the Kuwaitis, he will also want to talk about next steps in terms of resolving the U.S. \u2013 sorry, the Qatar dispute, taking advantage of Kuwait\u2019s leadership and mediation. He\u2019ll also talk about recent sale of F/A-18s that the Kuwaitis are purchasing from the United States, which is a $5 billion deal and will bring many jobs to the American defense sector.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right. And lastly --</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> So let me just briefly touch upon the counter-ISIS meeting and then very briefly on some of the Iraq reconstruction meeting. So obviously, the defeat of ISIS is one of the President\u2019s top foreign policy priorities, and about a year ago in March, the Secretary gathered all members of our coalition here at the State Department for a pretty historic meeting, and the point of that was really to look ahead at the next year. The focus on that meeting was very heavily on Mosul, which was an ongoing battle at the time, and also Raqqa, which we knew we\u2019d have to get after over the course of the coming year. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At that meeting, we raised about $2.3 billion of critical funding needs. And what that money did over the last year was help ensure that as we completed the military campaign in Mosul and Raqqa, we were also prepared for the humanitarian outgrowth of displaced persons. So in Mosul, for example, we had 1 million IDPs, and every single IDP \u2013 displaced person \u2013 from Mosul received humanitarian assistance and aid.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Over the last year \u2013 and I think it\u2019s also notable at that meeting in September<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, we had most members of the National Security Council, the cabinet here \u2013 Secretary Mattis, Director Coats and others \u2013 to talk about all we had to do to really strangle ISIS. And over the last year, we really accelerated the campaign. About 50 percent of all the gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria came over the last year \u2013 7.7 million people who used to be living under ISIS and are no longer, about 5 million of them were freed from ISIS over the last year. And the return of displaced to territories that used to be held by ISIS also accelerated this past year, 3.2 million Iraqis now back in their homes in areas that used to be controlled by ISIS. So pretty significant progress over the last year, which we want to kind of do a brief look back as we then look ahead. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019ve also added a number of members to the coalition since that gathering in March of last year, and that includes Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, and also NATO. That\u2019s significant because this is not just a fight, of course, in Iraq and Syria; it truly is a global campaign. This is now the largest coalition of its kind in history, with about 74 members, and as the Secretary cohosts this meeting in Kuwait, part of the focus will be making sure we really focus on the global nature of the campaign. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So there will be really two main elements of the meeting in Kuwait \u2013 the counter-ISIS ministerial. First will be focusing on consolidating the gains in Iraq and Syria, a heavy focus on stabilization and some funding gaps that we hope to close over the course of the next year. The coalition also importantly will endorse a guiding principles document for what we want to do together over the next year, and that will focus much more on law enforcement intelligence sharing, the very difficult work to make sure that we are catching these people as they cross borders, and doing all we can to protect our homeland. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So not only Iraq and Syria, but a real kind of emphasis over the next year on the global nature of the campaign \u2013 the foreign fighters, counter-messaging, intelligence and law enforcement cooperation. And our CT bureau and Ambassador Sales will be hosting a very important meeting of law enforcement officials from our coalition here next month. So that will be a key theme. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Very briefly, on the Iraq reconstruction conference, the Government of Iraq is working with the Government of Kuwait and the World Bank for this conference. It\u2019ll be held over the course of three days to bring together the donor community, civil society, and the private sector. The first day of the Kuwait reconstruction conference is focused on NGOs; the second day, private sector; and the third day, a meeting of government leaders. So Secretary Tillerson and other high level government representatives will attend the event, along with a really unprecedented 2,300 private sector representatives, high-ranking officials from regional governments, and representatives from international financial institutions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>There will be about a hundred American companies traveling to Kuwait for this event, and I think what you will see is a really innovative approach in terms of long-term post conflict reconstruction. And if you think of the template of these two meetings, the counter-ISIS meeting is focused on the immediate stabilization needs, and the reconstruction meeting is looking longer term. And this is not a program of direct U.S. Government contribution to projects; this is rather a more innovative approach focused on long-term financing, improving Iraq\u2019s macroeconomic stability, which we\u2019ve been doing through the IMF and the World Bank and others, to make sure that they are able to finance their long-term reconstruction needs. And I think there will be some fairly significant announcements coming out of those meetings, which I \u2013 which I won\u2019t get ahead of the Secretary, but that\u2019ll be quite important.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And back to the moderator.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>All right, thank you very much, and we\u2019ll now open this up for questions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone phone, *1. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating you\u2019ve been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the # key. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press *1 at this time. One moment, please, for the first question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Lee with AP. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi there, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve got three, but they\u2019re very brief. First of all, this trip, the Secretary\u2019s going to three of Israel\u2019s four neighbors. I\u2019m just curious as to why he is not going to Israel, particularly since the Kuwait stop seems to focus on the fourth of Israel\u2019s neighbor. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Secondly, [Senior State Department Official Five], on the announcements in Kuwait, I realize you don\u2019t want to get into specifics, but those would be private sector announcements or IMF/ World Bank types? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And the last one, for SAO One, [Senior State Department Official One], the MOU in Jordan \u2013 has there been any thought given to moving some of the UNRWA money that\u2019s on hold now to either Jordan or Lebanon to help them deal with whatever shortfall there might be for the Palestinians in both those countries? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> So, Matt, I\u2019ll take my two questions together. On the question of Israel, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fact that there\u2019s no Israel stop. These are always very complicated itineraries to pull together. The Secretary meets relatively frequently with Israeli officials when they\u2019re in town and stays abreast of the issues. So I wouldn\u2019t reach any conclusions about the fact that there\u2019s no Israel stop on this particular trip. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On the question of UNRWA, the MOU doesn\u2019t really deal with UNRWA money, although I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 I don\u2019t think that was your point. But the whole question of how we handle UNRWA funds in general, and then specifically for a country like Jordan, is something we\u2019re studying right now, at the White House particularly. And we\u2019ll reach some conclusions and formula on that soon I believe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE: </strong>Yeah, just briefly. So the IMF program, the Iraqis concluded a standby arrangement with the IMF, which we have \u2013 we\u2019re of course very much a part of helping facilitate. And that\u2019s delivered already about $2 billion in financing and projected to result in about $5.4 billion in budgetary support. That\u2019s the type of stuff that is far more important than the direct \u2013 than the direct contributions. We\u2019ve also provided a sovereign loan guarantee, which helped the Iraqis have a very successful billion-dollar unsupported bond sale back earlier last summer in August. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are the types of things that we\u2019re really focused on here. So working with EXIM Bank and OPIC and others and the private sector to have a more kind of really innovated approach working very closely with the Iraqi Government and its reforms and the World Bank, and its kind of vision over the next couple decades for how it intends to reconstruct and finance its reconstruction. So that\u2019s the focus of the meeting, and I think it will be quite interesting for those who follow these types of issues.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Also just finally, we\u2019ve done a lot of work in the region. Obviously, Secretary Tillerson was very focused early on on the opening between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The Secretary was in Saudi Arabia about three or four months ago for a pretty historic meeting King Salman and Prime Minister Abadi. And since then, we\u2019ve seen the opening of border crossings between Iraq and Saudi Arabia that have been closed for three decades, direct flights between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. And again, those are the types of things that are critical to Iraq\u2019s long-term reconstruction needs, and we look forward to of course seeing the Saudis at the meeting here in Kuwait over the coming days.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong> Thank you. Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Our next question comes from the line of Arshad Mohammed with Reuters. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good morning. Two topics I wanted to raise. One, with regard to Turkey, is the Secretary going to seek a commitment from the Turkish Government not to continue onto Manbij in its activities or its intervention in northern Turkey? And if he is not going to seek such an explicit commitment, is he going to seek at least some kind of commitment to pull back or restrain those activities by the Turks? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then secondly, for official number two, you made no explicit mention of the human rights situation in Egypt and the deterioration in that during Sisi\u2019s rule. And I wonder if you are going to explicitly raise those issues, and particularly, the issues of trying to achieve a fully free and fair election environment in a country where, as you\u2019re well aware, the \u2013 one of the main challengers to President Sisi was effectively prevented from appealing his disqualification because his lawyer got beaten up on the way to launch that appeal.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>So on your first question, I think what we\u2019ve said to the Turks in privately \u2013 in private has been exactly what we\u2019ve said to them in public, which is: we are urging them to show restraint in their operations in Efrin, and to show restraint further along the line across the border in northern Syria. Obviously, we need to work with the Turks to figure out more about what their long-term intentions are, and we need to work with the Turks more to figure out a way if there\u2019s a way that we can \u2013 that we can work with them to address their legitimate security concerns while, at the same time, minimizing civilian casualties and above all else keeping everything focused on the defeat ISIS fight, which is not over. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So that\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation. Turkish rhetoric has obviously been very hot on this topic, and so that\u2019s part of the value of going out, sitting down face to face, and talking through what our potential areas for cooperation are and what hard messages we need to give to them about restraint and focus. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>In terms of Egypt, concerns about human rights and civil society are a topic of continuing conversation with the Egyptians, and I imagine will be a topic that will be discussed on this upcoming visit. On the elections, we support a genuine and a credible electoral process, and we believe should guarantee the right for all citizens to participate freely and fairly. As we do around the world, we urge the Egyptian Government to respect freedom of expression, which is a fundamental pillar for any democratic society. And we have noted our concerns about the reports that Egypt\u2019s prosecutor general has launched an investigation into opposition figures ahead of the March 26th through 28th elections. These types of issues will be discussed on this visit.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Our next question comes from Carol Morello with <em>Washington Post</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I was just looking for a little more detail on both countries you\u2019ve already discussed. In Turkey, given that relationships \u2013 the relationship seems really near the breaking point, where does the Secretary see room to ease tension and for things to improve, given that the government allied press is calling the United States the enemy. And while he\u2019s there, does \u2013 given that Turkey has spoken with Iranian leaders recently, does he have any intention to talk about prisoners or a prisoner swap?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah, I mean, you\u2019re right to point out that particularly the issue of \u2013 particularly the issue of human rights and the arrest of our citizens and our locally engaged staff, that\u2019s first on the agenda on the bilateral package, and there\u2019s no pulling punches on that. We\u2019ve been very public in our call to the Turks to let these folks go, and we\u2019ve been very firm in our private conversations with them as well. That\u2019s an issue that\u2019s going to be a difficult one to work through, but it\u2019s one that we take seriously, because we have no higher priority than the safety of our people overseas. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>With regard to the broader bilateral relationship, look, it\u2019s difficult. The rhetoric is hot, the Turks are angry and this is a difficult time to do business, but it\u2019s our belief that there are still some very fundamental underlying shared interests that we have with the Turks, in terms of stability in Syria, defeating ISIS, fighting the PKK and broader questions of regional balance of power, where the Turks play an important role. So, at times like this, engagement is all the more important, but you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our next question comes from Felicia Schwartz with <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks so much for taking the question. One, I think for [Senior State Department Official Five]. I understand that the U.S. isn\u2019t going to be making a government contribution, but will other governments be making contributions at the reconstruction conference. And then, secondly, what \u2013 I guess this would be for [Senior State Department Official One] \u2013 in terms of \u2013 beyond UNRWA, what\u2019s the status of the deliberations on the broader aid to the Palestinians? I see the 251 million figure on foreign assistance back up, and if Tillerson is meeting with both counterparts in Kuwait, will he be making an ask of those countries to give more to the Palestinians if the U.S. is considering pulling back?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE: </strong>So, in terms of the \u2013 again, I just emphasized, I mean, the first day of the reconstruction conference is NGO\u2019s and we are of course the largest contributor to Iraqi humanitarian assistance, and \u2013 through various NGO\u2019s and the UN and others. But we\u2019re focusing our efforts here and we\u2019ve worked very closely with the Iraqis on this, on the kind of longer-term financing and what we can do to help them there. So again, that\u2019s going to be or focus. Yes, I do think there is a World Bank kind of project list that I think some governments and participants will be quite interested in, and contributing in, as well this unprecedented number of private sector companies that will be coming.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE</strong>: On the assistance \u2013 so our, certainly our internal deliberations about Palestinian assistance issues are ongoing, both internally and ultimately with the Hill. I think the Secretary \u2013 I think it\u2019s safe to say, in the Secretary\u2019s conversations with his counterparts, there will be a focus on this question of burden sharing, both in terms of assistance for UNRWA, for things like humanitarian aid in Gaza, which is urgently needed, and that has been expressed and discussed very clearly at the most senior level, and I\u2019m sure that will come up as well. And then the broader question of various forms of assistance for the Palestinians in the West Bank. Finding ways that other partners can step up and contribute, that\u2019ll be part of that discussion.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question comes from Gardiner Harris with <em>New York Times</em>. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you guys just talk about the general mood of this visit? Last year, of course, the President had a euphoric trip to the region, to Saudi Arabia (inaudible), but it \u2013 you\u2019ve \u2013 talking certainly about hard conversations in Turkey, but you\u2019re going to be having hard conversations at every one of these stops. In Jordan, the king, of course, is upset about the Jerusalem decision and is going to be struggling with the UNRWA decision, because many of the people who are educated and get health care through UNRWA live in his country, the same in Lebanon. In Kuwait it sounds like you\u2019re not getting the assistance help for Iraq that you hoped. So isn\u2019t it the case that the Secretary is going at a time of sort of deep difficulty for the United States, or at least a \u2013 there\u2019s a much different mood about this meeting than there was at this time or a little bit last year?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, this is [Senior State Department Official One] here. Just \u2013 I would only say you\u2019re right. This is \u2013 these are really tough issues and these are going to be tough conversations. The Secretary is going to do some very difficult, serious diplomacy. These are some of our closest partners, but they\u2019re also partners with whom we\u2019re facing some of the toughest issues that we have to face in the region, whether it\u2019s terrorism, whether it\u2019s the future of U.S. assistance, whether it\u2019s the final defeat of ISIS, whether it\u2019s maintaining partnership with an important NATO ally. All of these are, I think, emblematic of the need and the necessity for the Secretary to be out there doing face-to-face diplomacy with his counterparts.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FOUR:</strong> Gardiner, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a particularly tough conversation with the Kuwaitis. There aren\u2019t a lot of bilateral irritants in the relationship. I mean, one area that we\u2019re working on with many of our partners globally is reducing DPRK presence in countries. Kuwait is moving out on that front. We\u2019re going to ask them to do \u2013 to sort of close that issue out, but they\u2019ve been very, very responsive to that endeavor. And once again, Kuwait is a platform here for some really important events and discussions, so I don\u2019t think \u2013 and particularly on the Kuwait stop \u2013 that there will be any really difficult conversations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would just add to [Senior State Department Official One]\u2019s point that the underlying point here of the visit to Turkey is that this is an important NATO ally, one of our most important allies in the world and certainly in the region; and while we\u2019re having tough times, this is the time to go out and talk with them through the brass tack issues that we have to get through.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> Just to echo number three on Kuwait \u2013 so on ISIS, compared to where we were a year ago, it\u2019s a much different conversation. A year ago we were facing very serious threats to our homelands, particularly out of Raqqa and the environs of Raqqa. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the last year, but one of the key themes, obviously, will be that this is not over. There\u2019s still fighting in eastern Syria, and we\u2019re not going to quit until that is done. But in terms of the coalition, it is about as united as I\u2019ve ever seen it. It continues to grow and has very broad political support across the board globally. So I think that\u2019ll be an important theme.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And on the Iraq conference, this isn\u2019t like a snapshot and this is the one three-day period in which everything that will be done for Iraq reconstruction will happen in this three days. It\u2019s actually quite the opposite. As we move out of the period of very intense counter-ISIS operations and focus on stabilization, we\u2019re now shifting to longer term. The Iraqis with the World Bank will roll out kind of their vision for the future of how to do this, and this will then be a longer-term process, so it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 it\u2019s the beginning of a foundation for longer-term reconstruction. And I think given the level of participation, which is really quite extraordinary, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019ll be a very good start.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Thank you. We have time for one final question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our last question comes from Francesco Fontemaggi with AFP. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you for taking my questions. These meetings are coming amid a deterioration of the situation in Syria \u2013 in many parts of Syria. So what the coalition as coalition can try to do? You\u2019ve been issuing several warnings in the last days and weeks, but what can the coalition do? And thirdly, are you just going to ask them for restraint, or do you think that the operation in Afrin, which has now been lasting for a while, has to come to an end? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I\u2019ll start on Afrin. Obviously, you start with asking for restraint and look for ways that you can help bring it to an end as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t want to prejudge any of these conversations that the Secretary may have, but obviously, the quicker we come to a resolution on that situation, the better it is for the broader effort.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL FIVE:</strong> I would just \u2013 you asked about the coalition. So the coalition is focused on fighting ISIS, and our military coalition \u2013 to the extent our military is on the ground in Syria \u2013 the mission is to fight ISIS, as Secretary Mattis re-emphasized yesterday. Our mission in Syria is to defeat ISIS and ensure it is an enduring defeat of ISIS, which is where stabilization comes in. So that is the focus of the meetings of the counter-ISIS coalition, and obviously, the broader Syria issues will be discussed in bilats and other forums.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for calling in today and thank you to our speakers for sharing their time this morning, and the embargo is now lifted. Have a good day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">\n\t<span><span></span></span>\n\n\t<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"100%\"><span><span> </span></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><a name=\"_ftn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftnref1\"><span>[1]</span></a> March</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

The budget request modernizes State Department and USAID diplomacy and development to advance a more secure and prosperous world by helping to support more stable and resilient societies that will lead their own development and, ultimately, no longer need foreign aid. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The budget request supports the President\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision with a commitment to four key national priorities:</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><strong>Protecting America\u2019s Security at Home and Abroad:</strong></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span><span><span><strong>Sustaining Support for Efforts to Defeat ISIS and Other Violent Extremist Organizations</strong>: Supporting efforts to defeat ISIS and violent extremist organizations while addressing the conditions that these groups seek to exploit, including poor governance, weak institutions, lack of economic opportunity, corruption, and persistent human rights abuses with $5.7 billion.

Assistance also supports the needs of displaced religious minorities in the Middle East and North Africa. </span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span><strong>Upholding Commitments to Our Allies: </strong>Supporting the recent 10-year Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and Israel, this request provides $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel.

I\u2019m also very pleased to be with Foreign Minister Shoukry, who has become a friend as we have engaged on a number of challenges in the region and to address those jointly and with a great deal of agreement between us as to how those issues need to be addressed. I look forward to my meeting with President al-Sisi and appreciate his receiving me as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a very productive discussion on our shared regional and security concerns. We spoke about opportunities as to how to strengthen our ties and, as the foreign minister indicated, mechanisms by which we can deepen those ties and further explore areas for mutual cooperation, first through the strategic dialogue which we\u2019ve agreed we will have later this year, and then we\u2019re going to explore also the possibility of a 2+2 dialogue to even allow us to further enhance these conversations both on a full range of issues of not just security concerns, but political and economic opportunities as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI did express to the foreign minister our condolences to the people of Egypt for the violence that they have been suffering from the terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Egypt\u2019s been battling this level of extremism for many years, and we continue to be steadfast partners in their response to these attacks throughout this time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe agreed that we would continue our close cooperation on counterterrorism measures, including our joint commitment to the defeat of ISIS, and Egypt has been a very important member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition from the beginning. They \u2013 Egypt deals with the threats of ISIS themselves and are dealing with it certainly currently in the Sinai.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also discussed the importance of the protection and promotion of human rights and the vital role of civil society in Egypt. With the presidential elections planned for the end of March, the United States, as it does in all countries, supports a transparent and credible electoral process, and all citizens being given the right and the opportunity to participate freely and fairly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn Libya, the United States and Egypt support the UN\u2019s Action Plan for Libya for credible and peaceful elections in their country. This will promote stability \u2013 much-needed stability for Libya and their economy to prosper. As the Security Council affirmed on December the 14th, the Libyan Political Agreement in our view must remain the framework for a political solution throughout Libya\u2019s transitional period.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tForeign Minister Shoukry and I also discussed Syria and how we can work together to reinforce the UN-led Geneva political process, which is the only political framework through which this conflict can be resolved. And Egypt has played a very important role in supporting dialogue between opposition representatives and the central government in Damascus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Middle East peace, I reiterated that the Trump administration remains committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, the foreign minister and I also discussed how we can intensify our countries\u2019 economic engagement and support our private sectors to generate jobs and prosperity for both of our people, and I acknowledged and welcomed the very important \u2013 although we know difficult \u2013 steps towards reform that President Sisi has undertaken in order to create a very strong foundation for future prosperity and economic performance in Egypt, and those have been necessary, although difficult, to be fully \u2013 receive the full support of the IMF, and Egypt has met all of those requirements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll do what we can to continue to encourage the economic recovery and we hope that American companies are able to increase their investments in Egypt that will create jobs and opportunities here as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States, again, commits itself to standing with Egypt, standing shoulder to shoulder in these \u2013 in the fight against terrorism, but also standing together to create a more stable region for everyone as well, and I thank the foreign minister for our opportunity to meet and exchange on so many important issues. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think the commitment the U.S. has to Egypt\u2019s security in the fight against terrorism should be evident, and both with the release of about a billion dollars of foreign military financing assistance to Egypt to continue to strengthen its capabilities, and also sharing of other approaches to countering terrorism, some of which we can talk about, some of which we can\u2019t so easily talk about. But our joint commitment to defeat ISIS is steadfast and there has been no gap between Egypt and the United States in our joint efforts to confront terrorists and extremist \u2013 extremism in the region, but most specifically here in Egypt as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think the Egyptian people should be confident that the U.S. commitment to continuing to support Egypt in this fight against terrorism, in bringing security for the Egyptian people is steadfast, and that will continue, and we had a great deal of exchange today about how we can advance that. And we just mentioned the intent to have a strategic dialogue later this year. All of these are opportunities for us to identify other ways that we can strengthen and support Egypt\u2019s fight against terrorism, but also, ultimately, to strengthen the economic development of Egypt as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.) Carol, <i>Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Mr. Secretary, given the concerns (inaudible) to run against the president (inaudible) election and who were arrested and disqualified, how (inaudible) do you believe those elections will be? And will the United States consider withholding more military aid from Egypt (inaudible)?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, sir, human rights groups have called this the most repressive era in modern Egyptian history. What did Secretary Tillerson tell you about democracy and civil liberty here in Egypt? And will anything change here in Egypt after your meeting today? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think as I indicated in my prepared remarks, and I would answer the same: We have always advocated for free and fair elections, transparent elections, not just for Egypt but in any country. And so the U.S. is always going to advocate for an electoral process that respects the rights of its citizens to make the choices the citizens want to make and the full participation of citizens in those elections. And nothing has changed about our advocacy for those types of elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY: </strong>As relates to some of the comments that have been made by certain members of the human rights community and other activists, I would only recommend that you ascertain for yourself the nature and the current situation in Egypt as relates to human rights, and how the Egyptian people view this administration and its efforts to strengthen and protect human rights, and whether there is that sense of restriction that you alluded to. I think it is \u2013 it isn\u2019t helpful that a certain group projects from a perspective of lack of information, lack of direct association to a society, but it is much, much more important the general conditions, the freedom of press that is available, the variety of television shows, the dialogue and the exchange. Development in the social and political field is an evolutionary process. I think over the last 11 years, the Egyptian people have shown their commitment and their determination and their ability to change their course and to indicate their dissatisfaction. If they deemed that they were dissatisfied, they have been able to change two governments in the last seven years, and they have undertaken legislative elections and know how to protect their rights and to advocate for those rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s important that I think we recognize that it is the Egyptian people who should determine how they are applying their freedoms and their political activism, and I hope that you will have the opportunity while you\u2019re here in Egypt to discuss this with the Egyptians on the street and ascertain from them directly whether they are satisfied with current conditions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a discussion with the Secretary related to Egypt\u2019s efforts to develop both politically, economically, and socially, and that we continue to do so out of our desire to see Egypt evolve into a place of \u2013 that can fulfill the aspirations of its people, and we will continue to rely on the support that we can depend on from the United States in this regard. These are commitments that this administration is confident it will fulfill, and it is responsible to the Egyptian people to continue to fulfill those commitments, as has been stipulated in our constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think it\u2019s important to note that in the announcement President Trump made regarding Jerusalem he also made two very important points as well, one of which was he was not advocating for any change to the status quo as to oversight of the holy sites, recognizing the proper role of existing authorities; and the second is that the final boundaries of Jerusalem are yet to be determined, and that those will be decided among the parties. And those \u2013 I think it\u2019s oftentimes those two important points seem to have been overlooked in his announcement. And yes, the U.S. is still committed to the peace process and still believes we have an important role to play in bringing the parties together and seeing a resolution to this. And President Trump is committed to that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> (In Arabic.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> (In Arabic.) <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, Felicia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Secretary Tillerson, Vice President Pence, in an interview with <i>The Washington Post</i>, endorsed what you\u2019ve described publicly as talks about talks with the North Koreans, and president \u2013 South Korea\u2019s President Moon said he would go to Pyongyang. Is this the start of a diplomatic process in North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then for Foreign Minister Shoukry, the U.S. has in the past raised concerns about Egypt\u2019s ties with North Korea. What is Egypt doing to cut those ties?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> I\u2019m not sure I could hear the last part of your question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was just asking if this \u2013 is this the start of a diplomatic process with North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, as to \u2013 as to the Vice President\u2019s comments about potentially having talks and whether it\u2019s the start of a diplomatic process, I think it\u2019s too early to judge. As we\u2019ve said for some time, it\u2019s really up to the North Koreans to decide when they\u2019re ready to engage with us in a sincere way, a meaningful way. They know what has to be on the table for conversations. We\u2019ve said for some time that I think it\u2019s important that we have \u2013 we\u2019re going to need to have some discussions that precede any form of negotiation to determine whether the parties are, in fact, ready to engage in something this meaningful, in order for us to then put together the construct of a negotiation. So we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</strong> We did discuss with Secretary Tillerson the issues related to North Korea, the Korean Peninsula, and the security of that region. Egypt has had normal diplomatic ties with North Korea, as does many Western and NATO members, and those ties are, in terms of the relationship, limited to representation, and there is almost no existing economic or other areas of cooperation. But we are concerned with the current status with the threats emanating from the proliferation of nuclear weapons, a situation which we deem as threatening to the global nonproliferation regime, one that has to be dealt within our maintaining global security, also the threats of ballistic missile systems to South Korea and to Japan, and we believe that all of these issues must be resolved for the security of the region and the Korean Peninsula. And we will continue to discuss these issues and to take the appropriate measures to deal with these challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

And this is obvious through the ongoing collaboration and cooperation between the members of the coalition to defeat any kind of terrorism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn this occasion, I would like to reiterate my heartfelt congratulations to the Iraqi people on their victory, the historic victory and the liberation of their country from ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the amount of effort exerted by Iraq and the rest of the member countries in the global coalition in their war against so-called ISIS, and these efforts actually culminated in liberating Iraq from ISIS. Today, we are required to continue exerting efforts in times of peace just like we did in times of war.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStemming from this fact, the state of Kuwait has announced, upon the initiative of His Highness Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the emir of the state of Kuwait, may God protect him, it has announced the holding of the Kuwait International Conference for the Reconstruction of Iraq, which will be taking place alongside this current meeting in an effort to preserve the stability, security, and unity, as well as territorial integrity, of Iraq. This is an effort to pave the way and to find the favorable conditions to start the reconstruction of that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, despite the very positive developments and outcomes that we have achieved on the ground, the international community continues to face a direct threat by armed terrorist groups. And this is why it is a fair amount important for our coalition to continue exerting international efforts and to continue coordinating jointly to fight terrorism and to further develop the strategy set forth by the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this framework, we are full of hope that the efforts of the Government of Iraq will succeed and will be fruitful in holding the perpetrators of terrorist acts accountable, to avoid any impunity. And this should happen according to the UN mechanisms as reflected in the resolution, in the Security Council Resolution 237 of the year 2017. And also we need to exert or to step up the experience of Iraq in terms of judicial capabilities to \u2013 in this regard, and we need to continue working to stem the flow of terrorist \u2013 foreign terrorist fighters, in accordance to international resolutions 2396, 2253, 2199, 2178, and 2170.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, as part of its responsibilities in the Global Coalition Against ISIS, the state of Kuwait has hosted five international conferences to fight terrorism, and these include the Stabilization Working Group meeting, the meeting of the Small Group of the Global Coalition, the special meeting of the Counter-Messaging Working Group, the meeting of the Preventing Terrorism Financing Working Group, in addition to the meeting on preventing the flow of terrorists and foreign fighters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the end, I wish to welcome you once again in the state of Kuwait, and I hope that this meeting will be a successful one and will be a continuation of the many successes achieved by the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. And we hope that we will come up with recommendations and strategies that we can implement on the ground in an effort to protect the international community from extremism and terrorism. Thank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI now have the honor of giving the floor to my friend and colleague, the U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Rex Tillerson. The floor is yours, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Good morning, and thank you, Excellencies, Minister al-Sabah, for the \u2013 for welcoming me today, and I want to also greet excellencies, colleagues, and friends of the coalition. I appreciate the opportunity to address you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt has been approximately three and a half years since the global coalition began its effort to defeat ISIS. At the time we started our efforts, ISIS/Daesh was thriving. Today, ISIS/Daesh is failed. Approximately 98 percent of the territory once held by ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been liberated. Approximately 3.2 million Syrians and 4.5 million Iraqis have been freed from the tyranny of ISIS. Over 3.2 million internally displaced Iraqis are now back home. ISIS\u2019s leadership, online presence, and global network are under more pressure than ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the end of major combat operations does not mean that we have achieved the enduring defeat of ISIS. ISIS remains a serious threat to the stability of the region, our homelands, and other parts of the globe. Without continued attention on the part of coalition members, we risk the return of extremist groups like ISIS in liberated areas in Iraq and Syria and their spread to new locations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEach of us must continue our commitment to the complete defeat of ISIS. Maintaining stabilization initiatives is essential in this regard. If communities in Iraq and Syria cannot return to normal life, we risk the return of conditions that allowed ISIS to take and control vast territory. We must continue to clear unexploded remnants of war left behind by ISIS, enable hospitals to reopen, restore water and electricity services, and get boys and girls back in school.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, it is critical that the funding facility for stabilization be fully funded in this, its final year, in order to ensure the stabilization initiatives led by the Government of Iraq can be well-positioned to prevent a resurgence of ISIS. The United States appreciates the generous contributions of coalition members over the past year, but we all must do our part to ensure that (inaudible) stabilization (inaudible) in Mosul City, western Anbar, western Nineveh, and (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, the United States continues to be the world\u2019s largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian crisis. At the end of January we provided more than $216 million in new funding, bringing our total humanitarian assistance to nearly $7.7 billion since the start of the crisis. Today, I am announcing that we are providing an additional $200 million to further support critical stabilization and early recovery initiatives in liberated areas of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo ensure an enduring defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, we are working with the global coalition and local partners to consolidate military gains. Home forces are essential to securing liberated areas and setting the conditions for safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States will maintain a conditions-based and ISIS-focused military presence in Syria. As part of that presence, we will continue to train local security forces in Syria. We are also working to ensure the local forces we train are effective, professional, accountable, and respectful of human rights. It is essential that these forces be representative of their local communities and do not pose a threat to neighboring communities or neighboring countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, we remain concerned over recent events in northwest Syria and call on all parties to remain focused on defeating ISIS, de-escalating and resolving the Syrian conflict, and protecting innocent civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe are keenly aware of the legitimate security concerns of Turkey, our coalition partner and NATO ally. We will continue to be completely transparent with Turkey about our efforts in Syria to defeat ISIS, and we stand by our NATO ally in its counterterrorism efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs ISIS continues to evolve, so must the coalition. (Inaudible) ISIS is attempting to morph into an insurgency in places like Afghanistan, the Philippines, Libya, West Africa, and others, and is trying to carve our and secure safe havens. We have seen in Iraq and Syria the consequences of an ISIS territorial threat. History must not be allowed to repeat itself elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs ISIS fighters (inaudible) Security Council Resolution 2396 is a new and effective tool for countering threats posed by foreign terrorist fighters. The United States calls for quick implementation and full enforcement of the resolution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLastly, we must keep up the pace of combatting ISIS as it continually seeks to radicalize, recruit, and direct operations online. We must be aggressive in online spaces (inaudible) such as the instant messaging service (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe fight against ISIS will remain difficult. Coalition partners must call on all international powers to eradicate this threat. Every one of us must continue to adapt and strengthen our coalition through counter-ISIS\u2019s own network of foreign fighters, financing, and propaganda. And we must continue to deepen our partnerships in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States supports the revised guiding principles being presented today. They reaffirm our common determination to continue our efforts until we have achieved the full and enduring defeat of ISIS. And they (inaudible) our vision (inaudible) the coalition and our ongoing cooperative efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the opening line of the guiding principle says, \u201cWe are,\u201d and I quote, \u201cunited in our determination to defeat ISIS/Daesh through a focused, sustained, and multifaceted effort.\u201d It is now our duty to keep taking action that reflects that determination. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<span><span>We, the Foreign Ministers and principals of the Global Coalition, have come together in Kuwait City united in our determination to defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh through a focused, sustained, multifaceted effort. We know our enemy: ISIS/Da\u2019esh is intrinsically malevolent, celebrates cruelty, systematically violates international law and regularly commits gross abuses of human rights. Yet three and a half years into this effort, ISIS/Da\u2019esh stands undeniably degraded \u2013 it has lost its territorial hold in Iraq and only a few pockets of land remain under its control in Syria. Its leadership, on-line presence and global networks are under pressure. But our work is not done. ISIS/Da\u2019esh remains a serious threat to the stability of the region and to our common security. Enduring defeat will come when ISIS/Da\u2019esh no longer has safe havens from which to operate; when it no longer poses a threat to our homelands; and when it can no longer convey its ideology of hate globally. Recognizing that we are at an inflection point, where we must sustain attention to Iraq and Syria to secure our significant gains, while simultaneously adapting our footing to curb ISIS/Daesh\u2019s global ambitions, we offer these Guiding Principles as our vision for the future of this Coalition.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ultimately to achieve a full and enduring defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh, the Coalition will fully eliminate ISIS/Da\u2019esh as a territorial threat in Iraq and Syria and stabilize liberated communities in an inclusive manner. We will mobilize Coalition members and external partners, using a whole-of-government approach, to disrupt ISIS/Da\u2019esh networks and its branches and affiliates, including possible new manifestations and variants, and deny its freedom of movement, safe havens, and access to resources in accordance with and in support of UNSCR 2396. We will combat ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s ideology to prevent its reemergence, recruitment, and expansion. We will support local voices that offer an alternative vision to ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s propaganda, and we will redouble our efforts to deny ISIS/Da\u2019esh space to exploit social media and the Internet. We will work to consolidate our gains to date and prevent a re-emergence of ISIS/Da\u2019esh by supporting Iraqi-led political and security sector reforms, and, through UNSCR 2254, committing to reach a political solution in Syria, thus helping to address root causes for the appearance of ISIS/Da\u2019esh.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Our approach rests on a number of key pillars. First, we see this Coalition as a mobilizing and coordinating mechanism nested in a much larger diplomatic, military and counterterrorism ecosystem, in accordance with the principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, and relevant Security Council Resolutions. Second, we recognize nations bear primary responsibility for defending their homelands against ISIS/Da\u2019esh; our Coalition must work by, with, and through our partners. Third, membership in this Coalition is voluntary, as are the contributions each of us makes to this effort. Fourth and finally, we agree there is no single approach to the defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2013 each one is tailored to address the unique nature of the threat in a given country or region \u2013 importantly, most approaches to ISIS/Da\u2019esh globally will not mirror our efforts in Iraq and Syria, where Coalition-led military action has been central. That said, we agree there is great utility in sustaining collaboration and unity of purpose across the Coalition against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and ISIS-related threats on a global scale.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At the heart of our collaboration are the Coalition\u2019s Working Groups, and each one has a unique path forward. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Counter-Finance Working Group (CIFG) focuses on identifying and disrupting ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s ability to generate revenue and access the regional and international financial systems. As ISIS/Da\u2019esh adapts in response to its territorial losses in Iraq and Syria, the CIFG will adapt with it, leveraging its collaboration with like-minded multilateral organizations and encouraging members to take more concrete actions against ISIS/Da\u2019esh financing.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Foreign Terrorist Fighter Working Group (FTF WG) focuses on supporting and encouraging preventive, counter-terrorism-related information sharing through appropriate bilateral and collective law enforcement channels (such as Interpol), rehabilitation/reintegration, law enforcement and legal/criminal justice actions to mitigate the FTF threat (including FTF and their families returning, relocating and resurfacing). The FTF WG will continue to serve as a platform for an international whole-of-government approach, enhancing collaboration and capacity building within and across disciplines and seeking close connections and where possible integration with relevant international CT structures such as the Global Counterterrorism Forum.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Communications Working Group seeks to contest the information space in which ISIS/Da\u2019esh operates and to ensure that the contraction of the group\u2019s territory is followed by its ideological defeat. It co-ordinates and coalesces the strategic communications approaches of Coalition members; fosters external partnerships to amplify the reach and impact of the international community\u2019s efforts to degrade ISIS/Da\u2019esh propaganda; and it builds resilience in vulnerable audiences \u2013 all aimed at reducing ISIS/Da\u2019esh\u2019s capability to use propaganda to recruit, and to incite and inspire violence. We will share expertise and best practice to tackle future propaganda threats from other violent extremist organizations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Working Group on Stabilization plays a central role coordinating and promoting international stabilization efforts in Iraq and, where possible, in Syria. Successful IDP return is essential to consolidate the military defeat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh. In the course of 2018, as stabilization work in Iraq begins to conclude, the group will also assist the Iraqi Government's efforts to secure the significant military gains against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and prevent new violence in liberated areas by supporting the transition from stabilization to sustainable reconstruction. At the same time, the Police Training Sub Group will strengthen its focus on \u201cblue training\u201d and support the Iraqi government\u2019s efforts to restructure the Federal police and create a civilian police force that represents and is trusted by all citizens in Iraq. In Syria, the Working Group on Stabilization will coordinate and promote stabilization efforts with the aim of strengthening credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance, in accordance with and in support of UNSCR 2254.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The defense aspects of the Coalition also will continue to evolve as the nature of the threat changes and the Coalition increasingly focuses on ISIS/Da\u2019esh networks and branches. As with the Coalition's Foreign Ministers, Defense Ministries also will continue to coordinate regularly on how best to address the threat. The Coalition will pursue its military commitment in Iraq and Syria, and the existing Coalition Force Command in Tampa will continue to support the efforts in the region, in order to secure and stabilize the liberated areas to help retain our significant successes against ISIS/Da\u2019esh to date.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Across lines of effort, we will work to ensure women and women\u2019s organizations are fully and actively engaged and included in peacebuilding and stabilization efforts, in accordance with UNSCR 2242, and will seek to ensure our policies and practices are gender-informed and guided by international legal frameworks.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh was founded in September 2014 based on the worldwide concern over ISIS/Da\u2019esh and the threat it poses to international peace and security. The Coalition has made enormous progress since then, but our work is not done. Looking ahead, we recognize the need to remain alert to the inevitable evolution of the ISIS/Da\u2019esh threat, and to flexibly adapt our response, including through existing multilateral and regional counterterrorism and CVE institutions. We will revisit these Guiding Principles as appropriate. We recognize that the Coalition and its Working Groups serve to focus the international community\u2019s attention on countering the global/transnational threat of ISIS/Da\u2019esh. With that in mind, the Coalition should look to share its expertise into international counterterrorism efforts wherever possible, with an eye to a time in the future when the international community is confident it has the tools to address and neutralize ISIS/Da\u2019esh and ISIS-related threats.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

We\u2019re very glad to host him here. We pay great attention to this visit because we\u2019re passing through a very critical timing in our bilateral relations, and therefore we do believe that this visit is of utmost importance.\n\n\n<p>\n\tTurkey and the United States of America have been continuing their strategic partnership over the course of the history, increasing its depth every day, and with the steps that have been taken on both sides, this strategic partnership has been extended into various spheres. And it does not just include the two countries, but in our region and beyond, it includes many countries as well as many states and many nations who are benefiting from this strategic partnership. The basis of this strategic partnership is actually the fight that we gave together in Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our past, we had some ups and downs in our relations. We even had times of crisis, but always and always, the strategic partnership vision was at the forefront in terms of its mid-term and long-term goals. When we started dialogue in a frank and sincere environment, we were able to overcome all these critical phases together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, like I have said, we are passing through such a critical stage in our relations. Yesterday, we were received by the president of the republic, and we had a trilateral meeting, and we had the same sincere and frank atmosphere where both sides expected \u2013 expressed their thoughts, their expectations, and even their worries in a most sincere and frank manner. And the meeting, which took about three hours, was not just a meeting that we discussed our bilateral relations, but also our cooperation in regional issues as well as our mutual perspectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I said before, our relations are at a critical turning point. We were either going to correct this and continue our relations or we were going to go into a much more worse position. But with the will that we put forward as of yesterday, we have taken an important turn in terms of normalizing our relations. We reached an agreement and an understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, there are certain steps that are needed to be taken to achieve this. There are expectations on both sides. We have certain worries about the Fethullahist terrorist organization and our fight against this FETO terrorist organization, and the support that is provided by the United States on YPG and similar organizations, and our expectations pertaining to PKK. Of course, these are very important security worries that are closely related to our existence, and we do want to believe that these are taken into consideration seriously.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut up to this point, there were certain promises that were made, there were certain topics that we discussed, there were certain promises that were not kept, and there were certain issues that we could not resolve. So from this point on, we wanted to focus as to how we can take solution-oriented steps so that the issues are not just on paper, and we wanted to talk about how we can implement this, how we can make sure that they are implemented. So we were able to talk about all of these, and we decided to create a mechanism or even mechanisms to be able to discuss these and resolve them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne such mechanism, as you will see in the press declaration, is about the general issues: the consular issues, the issue regarding FETO, the Fethullahist terrorist organization, and some issues that the United States attaches importance to. Actually, we had a working group that we established after the visa crisis, but now we are going to extend the content of all of these and we will be talking about all of these together. For instance, on the FETO issue, do we have evidence or not? Do we need any additional evidence? Is the evidence that we have sent sufficient? Instead of discussing this in length before the public, we want to discuss this in the working \u2013 (break in audio) \u2013 because in order to reach any conclusion, any result, we need to work together and act together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(Break in audio.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Syria issue, we also talked about how we are going to overcome our worries regarding the Syrian issue: which steps are we going to take, how are we going to fight against terrorist organizations, how are we going to establish stability in those cities that have been cleared of terrorist attacks, how \u2013 who is going to do this, how are we going to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq, and most importantly, how are we going to work together to achieve a political resolution with the Geneva process. So we were able to talk about how we will take concrete steps with our experts so we\u2019re not talking about promises or commitments any longer. We want to overcome all of these by working together, and I am sure that all of these will bring important results for us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll these mechanisms are not kicking the ball off to the corner. They are not delaying the process. To the contrary, these are important aspects to get results and mechanisms that will achieve results that will meet the expectations of both sides. So we are not trying to gain time, and hopefully, the next meeting is going to take place before the middle of March. We have agreed on this aspect as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the end, distinguished members of the press, the meetings that we had yesterday and today have been important in terms of the future of our bilateral relations, in terms of overcoming our mutual worries, and both on Syria, Iraq, and especially on the issue of the fight against terrorism. The cooperation with respect to regional issues were important, and this was a critical visit and a critical series of meetings. I do believe that once the relations are set into track again, what is important is as a result of all these visits and meetings to be able to take step towards the future jointly, commonly, in partnership, and get results. So we will work like two allies, establishing trust once again, and we will base our relations on this basis that have been strengthened by our partnership and alliance thoughts. With these opinions and thoughts, once again I would like to say welcome to our guest, Mr. Tillerson, and leave the floor to him, and then we will be answering questions from your side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, I want to thank Foreign Minister Cavusoglu for his hospitality during this visit, and I also want to express my appreciation to President Erdogan for the extensive amount of time he provided to me yesterday evening so we could have a very full discussion of both sides\u2019 concerns but also a lot of discussion about the future and how we go forward from where we are today. I want to reaffirm the deep and important relationship between the United States and Turkey. Ours is not an alliance of convenience or of temporary interest. It is a time-tested alliance built on common interest and mutual respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTurkey was one of the first countries to join NATO. Turkish troops served alongside Americans in Korea, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo. We have made many shared sacrifices together. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Turkey against terrorist threats. Turkey is a critical partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Daesh. We\u2019re grateful that Turkey has allowed the United States and other NATO countries to base forces in Incirlik, and Turkey is the linchpin of strategic stability at the crossroads of the three continents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur two countries share the same objectives in Syria: the defeat of ISIS, Daesh; secure and stable zones; an independent and unified Syria; and help chart a new democratic future for Syria under the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 process. We are hopeful that the Geneva process will produce a new constitution for the Syrian people and elections to be held under UN auspices. A democratic future for Syria is essential for preventing ISIS from re-emerging and from stopping the suffering that the Assad regime has inflicted on the Syrian people. The Turkish Government and people deserve the gratitude and recognition for the unprecedented hospitality they have displayed in hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize the legitimate right of Turkey to secure its borders. We take it seriously when our NATO ally Turkey says it has security concerns. As to Afrin, we call upon Turkey to show restraint in its operation to minimize the casualties to civilians and avoid actions that would escalate tensions in that area.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve been transparent with Turkey regarding our objectives in Syria. Our relationship with our NATO ally Turkey is enduring and strategic. I again conveyed this message to President Erdogan and to the foreign minister today, as have many other U.S. officials. We have always been clear with Turkey that the weapons provided to the Syrian Democratic Forces would be limited, mission-specific, and provided on an incremental basis to achieve military objectives only.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have long supported and will continue to support Turkish democracy. Respect for the rule of law, judicial independence, and an open press are a source of strength and stability. When Turkey maintains its commitment to these principles, it expands our potential partnership. We support the Government of Turkey\u2019s right to bring the perpetrators of the 2016 coup to justice. It is important to handle these cases in a transparent and fair manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. We continue to have serious concerns about the detention of local employees of our mission in Turkey and about cases against U.S. citizens who have been arrested under the state of emergency. We will continue to engage with our Turkish counterparts to seek a satisfactory resolution to these cases, and we call upon Turkey to release Pastor Andrew Brunson and other U.S. citizens whom we believe are being unjustly detained. With regard to Serkan Golge, we believe his release through the appeals process would be both just and appropriate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want to thank again President Erdogan and Foreign Minister Cavusoglu for the opportunity to discuss these and many other very, very important issues, and for the cooperation we both have been able to show one another and respect in charting a way forward in this relationship. The United States truly appreciates our long friendship with Turkey. We value it, and we look forward to strengthening it as we move forward. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> (In Turkish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Sevil Erkus from <i>Hurriyet Daily</i>. My first question will be to our guest, Secretary of State. Mr. Tillerson, we are actually passing one of the most critical stages of the Turkish-United States relations. In order to overcome these problematic aspects \u2013 the aspect pertaining to the assistance of military equipment to YPG and PYD \u2013 Ankara worries. In order to overcome all these worries, and also, in the context of Syria, to establish cooperation between Turkey and United States, do you have any proposals for solutions? Could you share these with you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, if the Afrin operation is extended to Manbij, the fact that there are American soldiers there \u2013 do you have any plans to withdraw forces from that region, or the fact that they\u2019re at harm?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy question to you, Mr. Foreign Minister --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) So we said actually two questions each, but you have asked more than 10 now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) My question to you: Before you said either these relations are going to go worse or going to be improved. You said today that you had taken a decision to normalize relations. Did you get the relevant warranties or safeguards from the United States that you were expecting from your side?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother aspect: With respect to a news item that was reflected on the media, it was indicated that the troops on Manbij would be withdrawn to the eastern part of Euphrates and that this was a proposal that you brought. Did you make such a proposal indeed so that the American troops were withdrawn from that area, and how does American side resolve?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) So this is actually a question for two hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>In our discussions last night with President Erdogan, we brought forward proposals on how we can address all of the critical issues that are standing between this relationship today. And those will be addressed \u2013 some will be addressed in the joint statement that we will be releasing following this press avail. But the foreign minister did touch on a few of those, and we want to work specifically on the issues that are standing between us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat we have agreed is our objectives for Syria are precisely the same. There are \u2013 there\u2019s no daylight between Turkey and the U.S. objectives: defeat ISIS, stabilize the country, create stabilization areas so eventually refugees and internally displaced persons can begin to return home, and support the political solution for Syria that will result in a whole, independent, democratic Syria with no special demarcations dividing Syria and with the Syrian people selecting their leadership through free and fair elections. And we all share that same objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd now, going from this point forward, we are going to closely coordinate our efforts against the final defeat of Daesh. We do not have them fully defeated today, but we\u2019re going to coordinate our efforts against the final defeat of Daesh as well as other terrorist groups that are located inside of Syria. We want to coordinate how to stabilize areas together and who will occupy those areas. And the objective and intent is to return these villages, these cities back to the composition of people who were there before they were overrun by Daesh. So we\u2019re going to address Manbij first. It\u2019s one of the first areas we\u2019re going to work on. The United States made commitments to Turkey previously. We\u2019ve not completed fulfilling those commitments. Through the working group we\u2019re going to address that, and Manbij is going to receive priority.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut it\u2019s not just Manbij. We have to think about all of northern Syria, and we\u2019ve agreed on certain areas we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work together, and then we\u2019re going to coordinate very closely on supporting the Geneva process, because ultimately, that is the pathway to a peaceful, stable Syria. That improves Turkey\u2019s security as well on its border when we can achieve that final peace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. At the beginning of my remarks, I said that this was a very critical visit for the future of our relations. It was a critical timing. Therefore, in the meetings that we held since yesterday evening, we talked about how our expectations were to be met, and there were other concerns of the United States on their citizens, about the local employees of the consulate. There were, of course, expectations on their side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re already working on these consular issues, but our worries were in direct relation to the direct threats that we were receiving about the YPG attacking our citizens, because our people are dying. Up to this point, we had about 100 citizens, Turkish citizens, or Syrian-origin people coming from Afrin. They were killed by missiles or by arms that were coming from Afrin. They lost their lives because of this. So of course, undoubtfully, this working group which is going to meet our expectations and the concrete steps that we will take is crucial. This is important on YPG, on ISIS/ISIL, on FETO. These are important with relation to all of these aspects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, on Manbij, of course, Rex Tillerson gave the answer to your question. And in 2016, there were commitments of the United States to Turkey at every level, including President Obama, John Kerry, and Mr. (inaudible), who is still at his position, and by other people in high-level positions, but these promises were not kept. And even at one point, we were to send a delegation to tell that YPG was actually going to move to the eastern part of Euphrates, but from that visit we were not convinced and we learned later on that they had not moved. So in this process, we are going to start from Manbij, and we will be sure of the steps that we have taken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also need to ensure that YPG is going to move to the eastern part of the Euphrates. We need to see the implementation together, and Rex stated very clearly: For stability in these regions, we will talk about as to who is going to manage these cities and who is going to provide the security. If Manbij is 95 percent Arab town, it actually does not make any sense that YPG is going to provide security there, because that will mean that there will not be any stability there. So we will be talking with this understanding so that stability is attained and we will be rest assured of the security. It\u2019s not just for Manbij, but we will start from there. And once YPG leaves that and after we have the trust established, we will be able to take steps together with the United States of America, but now YPG needs to leave that zone, and this is a commitment that the United States of America has made to us, and we will be talking about the implementation of how this promise will be kept. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> (In Turkish.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Mr. Secretary, there seems to be a little short on specifics here. Do you agree that you are talking about what you\u2019re going to do in the future and you have not agreed on specific steps that will begin starting today? And can you explain why it has taken so long for two allies to come together with an agreement on what seems to be a very basic principle, that two allies will not shoot at each other in Syria and one will not give the other an \u201cOttoman slap\u201d? Are you confident that in the future some of the rhetoric will be turned down, and what has been the hang-up?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Foreign Minister, I wanted to ask you if you agree that some of the rhetoric in recent weeks from yourself and your president has been overheated and unhelpful. And also, what will it take for your government to finally be confident enough to lift the state of emergency and release thousands of your own citizens, plus the American citizens and embassy employees who have been imprisoned on what much of the world considers to be very flimsy evidence? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, with respect to how we\u2019re going forward \u2013 and that\u2019s what all of the discussion here was about, recognizing where we find ourselves. And I think as the foreign minister indicated, we find ourselves at a bit of a crisis point in the relationship. And we could go back and revisit how we got here, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s useful. We\u2019ve decided and President Erdogan decided last night we needed to talk about how do we go forward. The relationship is too important, it\u2019s too valuable to NATO and our NATO allies, it\u2019s too valuable to the American people, it\u2019s too valuable to the Turkish people for us to not do anything other than concentrate on how are we going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd out of the meetings last night \u2013 and much of our staff was up through the night to memorialize how we\u2019re going to go about this, and we\u2019ll share a little bit of that in the joint statement. We\u2019re going to reserve a lot of the details because there\u2019s a lot of work yet to be done, and we \u2013 and our working teams need to be allowed to do that work in a very open, frank, honest way with one another so that we can chart the way forward together. And I think that\u2019s the important point I want you to take away here, is we\u2019re not going to act alone any longer. We\u2019re not going to be U.S. doing one thing and Turkey doing another. We are going to act together from this point forward. We\u2019re going to lock arms, we\u2019re going to work through the issues that are causing difficulties for us, and we\u2019re going to resolve them and we\u2019re going to move forward with the future defeat of ISIS in terms of coordinating our efforts to complete this battle, which is not yet complete; to addressing other terrorist presence inside of Syria; to stabilizing areas and ensuring that the stability architecture, both security forces and governing councils, are representative of the conditions that existed in those cities before they were overrun by ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we have good mechanisms on how we can achieve that, but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. People are going to have to roll their sleeves up. We\u2019re going to get started very quickly. As the foreign minister said, we\u2019re going to have the first round of these engagements before the middle of March. We know we need to move with some sense of urgency and promptness to address this, because we have a serious situation still inside of Syria, and we need to address that jointly together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I would say the specifics will emerge out of the work as we allow these groups to come together, but I think the objective, we\u2019ve made clear as to what our objective is. So now we\u2019re going to have a team of people working towards putting that in place and implementing it, and we\u2019ve given you a little bit \u2013 just a little bit of a peek of some of the early priorities we\u2019re going to place for these groups to work on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much for your question. Since last night, we have been talking about how we can overcome these problems, and these are not just explanations and announcements coming from our side. That will not be a realistic approach. Our declarations was not declarations of enmity. And of course, we were taking into consideration our worries and the realities that we show \u2013 show from our side.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLikewise, as politicians, sometimes we take certain steps, and by the steps that we take and by the commitments that we have paid, we might be guiding this popular sentiment with the positive inputs. But when it comes to a point \u2013 this is true for all political sphere, but in Turkey, the president of the republic and we as politicians, including me, we should be voicing the opinion of the Turkish public, because we are representing them. And the declarations that we made were just ramifications of the popular thought in Turkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the detention or the prosecution that is taking place \u2013 this does not have anything to do with the state of emergency in Turkey, and this state of emergency is nothing to restrict the fundamental rights and freedoms of Turkish citizens or anybody living in Turkey. In 2003, one of the first steps that we took when we came to government was actually to remove the state of emergency in southeast part of Turkey. In some European countries, after one terrorist attack there is a state of emergency declared. But we, on the other hand, were \u2013 the leader of a terrorist organization who is residing in Pennsylvania attempted a coup in our country. So with the state of emergency, we needed to take rapid steps against this terrorist organization. This was the expectation of our people. So the prosecution that is continuing in Turkey has been in line with the EU, with the Council of Europe criteria, and in line with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the legislation which has been democratically enacted in Turkey in parallel with those standards.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this prosecution within the state of emergency has nothing to do with any judicial proceeding that goes on in this period. Therefore, independent courts that have been established and that have been reformed with the legislation in parallel to the standards of the EU and the Council of Europe are conducted. It does not have any \u2013 does not receive any direction from any other third country or a political intervention from within. And the state of emergency does not have any connection to this. We do hope that within this whole process we would always have the following: that in terms of accelerating in the prosecution we might have certain recommendations, but in the end, the independent judiciary passes judgment. The appeal process is open. You can go all the way up to the constitutional court. We do have an individual application system to the constitutional court and even the European Court of Human Rights. So the remedies in terms of the legal sphere go all the way up to Strasbourg within that understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Gonca Senay from TRT World. I have questions to both ministers. In terms of earning in the trust of the Turkish public, I think we listed the expectations on the Turkish side, but I do want to ask a question to Mr. Tillerson, especially reminding him of the budget drop that was proposed by Pentagon. Will the arms assistance provided to YPG by the United States of America \u2013 is it going to cease? And this morning, there was certain news that the Turkish soldiers would be acting together with the American soldiers in Manbij. Thirdly, will you take a step on the FETO issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMr. Cavusoglu, my question to you is that you talked about certain mechanisms involving FETO, and you said that you were talking about the mid-March. Is there any timetable, or is this an agreement that both sides have reached? And what is going to be the level of this working group? What level in the administration? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>With respect to DOD\u2019s budget for the coming year, only sufficient funds have been included in their budget to continue the defeat of ISIS campaign, and this is to continue to supply the SDF forces primarily with ammunition, because this fight goes on. There\u2019s no more being provided than we believe is necessary to complete the battle to defeat Daesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe question of Manbij is one that, as I said, is going to be given priority in our joint working group effort, and this is one of \u2013 as the foreign minister indicated, one of the issues for us to work together on is what kind of security should be provided. Manbij is strategically a very important city from the standpoint of our defeat of Daesh but also our containment and ensuring that they do not re-emerge. It\u2019s geographically important. That\u2019s why the U.S. has left a troop presence in Manbij to ensure that that city remains under control of our allied forces and does not fall into the hands of others. So that will be a topic for discussion in terms of how we go forward to ensure Manbij remains within our control because of its strategic importance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd we did agree \u2013 we had a lot of conversation last night with President Erdogan regarding the concerns over Fethullah Gulen back in the United States as well as his organization, and we\u2019ve agreed that we will continue to examine all the evidence that can be provided to us. We will continue our own efforts at our own independent investigations to ensure that we know when illegal activities are being carried out in the United States, and we remain open and anxious to receive any new information and evidence that the Turkish Government can provide us as well. So it remains an open investigation with the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. As I have just mentioned and I \u2013 as I repeatedly say, the purpose of these mechanisms and working groups is to keep the promises that were not kept so far, and in order to take tangible and concrete steps. This is true for YPG; this is true for FETO as well. And in Syria, not only ISIS/ISIL, because we have achieved important results regarding ISIS/ISIL, and the Republic of Turkey has fighted more than everyone in this fight, and it just killed more than 3,000 Turks in just Syria. And as \u2013 in \u2013 with regards to foreign fighters, their extradition and their prevention in terms of entering in the country, we have taken important steps and we have also served as a co-chair as well in the council. But we need to fight against all types of terrorist organizations in order to achieve the political framework that we have just described with new constitution, with new laws. We want to take the country to an election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, these working groups will have different boards, and for example, in the first one, the ministry of foreign affairs will be the coordinator. However, there will be officers from the intelligence unit from the ministry of justice as well. And especially regarding financial crimes and regarding topics about the corruptions of FETO terrorist organizations, we will have representatives from the department of financial crimes. And as it was mentioned by Rex and by relevant authorities, recently there are investigations carried out regarding FETO schools in this United States, and it will bear us the results about the corruption taking place in the U.S. and how they achieve, how they earn these money for election. And with just simple investigations, we \u2013 they will see these results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd again, regarding Syria, we will have our soldiers \u2013 I mean the ministry of defense \u2013 we will have intelligence units and other relevant authorities in these groups and in these wars. So we have identified the participants and we have agreed on the parties as well, and from now on we will try to come together and achieve results altogether.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Did you warn Turkey that they could be subject to sanctions under CAATSA legislation if they go ahead with the purchase of the S-400 system?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd for you, Mr. Foreign Minister, would the threat of U.S. sanctions stop you from going ahead with the purchase of the S-400 system? And if you do buy the system, do you still want to remain in NATO if you\u2019re obtaining the weapons from Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>We did discuss the impact of the CAATSA law that was passed by the Congress last summer that deals with purchases of Russian military equipment. I discussed it last night with President Erdogan; we had further discussions this morning about it. And indeed, it\u2019s in the first group of issues that the foreign minister is referring to. We need to put a group of experts together, and we\u2019ll look at the circumstances around that, as we\u2019ve done with governments all over the world, not just Turkey, because the intent of that legislation was not to harm our friends and allies. But it is directed at Russia for its interference in our elections. So we\u2019ve been advising countries around the world as to what the impact on their relationship and purchases that they might be considering with Russia, and many have reconsidered those and have decided to not proceed with those discussions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEvery case is individual on its own. We want to consult with Turkey and at least ensure they understand what might be at risk in this particular transaction. We don\u2019t have all the details yet, so I can\u2019t give you any kind of a conclusion, but it\u2019ll be given very careful scrutiny, obviously, and we\u2019ll fully comply with the law. And we are \u2013 we are now implementing CAATSA and fully applying it around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER CAVUSOGLU:</b> Thank you very much. First and foremost, I need to underline that I am against the terminology that you use. You used the threat terminology. That is not a correct terminology to be used because it is true for all countries and states. We never use the language of threat and we deny if it is used against us, because this is not correct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut as Rex has also indicated, this was not something that we talked just yesterday and today. When we met in Vancouver, we talked about this, and from time to time when we have phone conversations, we talk about such issues. This was again brought to the agenda in one of those talks. Of course, there is a law that was enacted by the United States Congress, and they explained this legislation to us. But on the other hand, this is our national security, and it\u2019s important for our national security. I have emergency need of an air defense system. We want to purchase this from our allies, but this does not exist. So even when we are purchasing small-scale arms, the Congress or some other European parliaments, we have \u2013 we have and we had difficulty in purchasing these because of these excuses, and I have an emergency need. And the Russian Federation came up with attractive proposals for us. We also talked to other countries, not just with Russia, but we talked about this issue of emergency need with many countries and we had bilateral talks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in the mid-term, we talked about joint production and technology transfer. We focused on this because this is important for Turkey. And lastly, during the Paris visit of our president \u2013 with Eurosam \u2013 this is a French-Italian partnership \u2013 there was a pre-agreement signed, a memorandum of understanding signed with these groups. So we do not have any problems with our allies. Why should we not meet this requirement with NATO? But, of course, when it is not met within this platform, we need to look for alternative resources. Otherwise, some batteries \u2013 some Patriot were withdrawn from our frontier. Some European allies withdrew them. We have (inaudible) of the Italians and Patriots of Spain, and we do not have any other air defense. And we need to meet this requirement as soon as possible. And when we talked to Russia, this was actually an agreement that we reached before the legislation in Congress was enacted. And the remaining part was about the details of loans, et cetera.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOf course, we talked about all of these, and we will take into consideration this \u2013 within this working group the commission, but all of us need to understand each other and respect each other. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us for today\u2019s teleconference. Today we will have senior State Department officials previewing the Secretary\u2019s upcoming travel to the continent of Africa. I want to remind you that today\u2019s call is on background, and I\u2019ll describe the attribution in just a few seconds.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Today\u2019s conference \u2013 our briefers today will be [Senior State Department Official One]; from here forward he will be referred to as Senior State Department Official One. We are also joined by [Senior State Department Official Two]. He will be referred to as Senior State Department Official Two. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We\u2019ll open up with brief remarks from Senior State Department Official One, and then we\u2019ll turn it over for your questions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Okay. Thank you very much, and thank you on this very window day here in Washington, D.C. for joining all of us. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The trip by Secretary Tillerson really is an outgrowth of the ministerial meeting for 37 ministers from Africa back in November of 2017, and this will be a kind of follow-up with the Secretary traveling to Africa. So his trip is going to begin on Tuesday, March 6th, and it will take him to \u2013 first to Ethiopia and then down to Djibouti and then Kenya, and then all the way up to Chad, and then down over to Nigeria. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So this trip is really \u2013 and we apologize for kind of the last-minute \u2013 because we\u2019ve been just back and forth on how the trip would be arranged and the schedules and the trips going in and out and which countries to select. And so \u2013 and also given the Secretary\u2019s tight schedule, this is what we came up with, and we announced it yesterday.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the whole purpose of the trip is really to follow up on the ministerial meeting, and that is if Africa in the year 2100 is going to form 40 percent of the world\u2019s population, over 30 percent of the work force, yet also have the potential of having 50 percent unemployment rate, which is very high, that is a security issue, a economic issue problem, but more important, it\u2019s also an opportunity. And so the United States says, \u201cHow do we position ourselves to play a significant role in supporting Africa and also as a \u2013 to highlight this important relationship?\u201d And we said it\u2019s going to be based on \u2013 not only on economic and commercial development, but in the context of building strong institutions, governance, and security, as well as human rights.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issue, too, that we\u2019re looking at is how to really keep African resources and also development beneficial for the people of Africa. Right now we\u2019re looking at the growing indebtedness in Africa. That\u2019s not a good thing. We\u2019re looking at other countries, not helpful countries, other countries too, expropriating a lot of resources. And as you know, high rates of rare earth minerals and metal are from Africa. I mean, just one example is if your cell phone is 10 percent of that material comes from resources in Africa, in the next decade it\u2019s going to be 25 percent. Then that\u2019s an issue of: How do we do rational allocation of resources? How do we benefit the people of Africa? How do we create jobs? How do we really develop Africa, and not just become a repository for the development of other regions of the world?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are some of the issues and challenges that we\u2019re facing, and we can \u2013 through the Q&amp;As, we can go into what we seek to achieve in each country. But the bottom line is really economic development, how to build strong institutions, and also to move forward in the future for Africa. And just for your information, three of the four \u2013 three of the embassies being visited or countries visited has the largest American embassies in Africa. And just for your information, we have 44 American embassies and six consulates and offices in Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So we\u2019re set. We can turn it up to Q&amp;As.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone phone. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating you\u2019ve been placed into the queue. You can remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. And if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you do have a question, you may press * then 1 at this time. One moment, please, for our first question.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And our first question from the line of Felicia Schwartz with <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Your line is open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the counterterror objectives of the trip. It seems like Djibouti, Chad, some of these stops are very counterterror focused, so if you could talk about some deliverables you expect or what you\u2019re hoping to achieve.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> So the issue comes in as there\u2019s really no deliverables, and the reason why is because for the Secretary of State and for our trip now it\u2019s really to underscore the commitment of the United States to Africa but also to explore with the leadership in each of the countries about what we want to achieve at the \u2013 together as partners but also in our overall program. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So going into Djibouti \u2013 so Djibouti is, as you know, mainly French relationships, but we also have \u2013 it\u2019s also the base for the only U.S. military base in the entire region. But it\u2019s more than just the U.S. military. I was there when Camp Lemonnier first started back in 2001. We\u2019re really talking to President Guelleh and his government because, as you know, Djibouti after the <i>USS Cole </i>bombing in Yemen \u2013 Djibouti now becomes really the main refueling spot for all U.S. Naval ships and also support for the U.S. as well as French military bases, the Japanese, our two task forces. We have 150 and 151 which does counterterrorism and counterpiracy.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But the focus is also how do we really continue to have a strong relationship with Djibouti. As you know, Djibouti is part \u2013 has troops in Somalia as part of AMISOM, which is to stabilize Somalia and to move it forward. And Djibouti has become a important country in peacekeeping operations.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And let me just kind of give you one factoid. So if 53 percent of all UN operations are in Africa, 87 percent of the world\u2019s UN troops are in Africa, and almost 70 percent \u2013 actually over 50 percent \u2013 of all the troops are African, then that becomes very important. So for us, what we\u2019re looking at is how do we deal with Djibouti as a partner in that realm as far as peacekeeping operations. And the second area is to continue having good U.S. military relationships, because that is our base there. And it\u2019s not just a base for counterterrorism but also to support the security of all the other countries in the region. So I hope that kind of helps. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>On Chad, let me just give \u2013 on Chad is we\u2019re working with President Deby because, as you know, they were given on the visa sanctions list. That\u2019s not a good thing. They have been trying to get off those lists. They\u2019ve made tremendous motivations and movement toward getting off that list, so we\u2019re trying to support them as best we can and also to improve their own personal security.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We also want to give Chad importance because they\u2019re part of the G5 countries and their troops have made a tremendous amount of sacrifices in providing troops in supporting Mauritania and Niger and other countries in the G5 area. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So that\u2019s what we would \u2013 that\u2019s part of it. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Hi. And I just want to remind everyone to please make sure that your phone is on mute if you\u2019re not speaking. Thanks very much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have a question from Abigail Williams with NBC News. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi there. Thanks for doing the call. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> At the \u2013 towards the top in your opening you talked about the importance of focusing on development in these countries and job opportunities.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yes.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> What is it that the Secretary will be doing on this trip to try to help with that in the various countries he\u2019ll be visiting?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> I think we need to look at how to build \u2013 and so for instance, the countries that we\u2019re going to, so Kenya is our largest embassy in all of Africa. And then of course followed by South Africa, which we\u2019ll probably go later, and then of course Nigeria and then Ethiopia. And so \u2013 and Ethiopia, as you know, you\u2019re looking at transition from a prime minister to another prime minister, and so there we want to make sure that we\u2019re working with the Ethiopian partners on institution building, human rights, engagement, community leadership, et cetera, which will make them a much stronger partner. And also because of its 8 percent economic growth rate, it really is \u2013 becomes an engine for economic growth for the entire region. So that\u2019s \u2013 so we\u2019re trying to look at how we can work with that country.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And I\u2019ll give you one \u2013 sorry, I\u2019ll kind of go off tangent here. Ethiopia, had purchased something like $2 billion worth of Boeing 787s transport airplanes and also 777s. And so the prime minister, the late Prime Minister Meles, said, \u201cYou know, we just saved 35,000 American jobs. What are you doing to help Ethiopia?\u201d And that was a very valid, fair question. And so what we\u2019ve been doing is trying to look at the various sectors where they have economic advantages and opportunities, and that\u2019s in the ag sector. So in other words, their coffee, their flour, they even do Fruit of the Loom and Starbucks apron productions. But we\u2019re looking at much more. So in other words, in our discussions with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs and others, we\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat is it that we need to do to help these countries develop from agriculture to industrialization and then to consumer-based industrialized growth?\u201d And Ethiopia, I think, is on that track, but what are the mechanisms? What is it that we need to help them with as far as savings rate, education, and industrialization, and access to resources? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so as you know, the United States, we don\u2019t build things, but we teach things. And so our biggest thing is education, girls\u2019 education, women entrepreneurs, helping with expanding electrification. And certainly on a continent where most people do not have access to electricity and electricity is really critical for industrialization, that\u2019s important. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So going back to girls\u2019 education, in all our areas of development is \u2013 girls\u2019 education is very inexpensive, but it really brings out a lot of high-volume growth. Anywhere we have high girls\u2019 education, we also have high rates of growth. And when I was in Afghanistan, we were in the northern part. We had 40 percent girls\u2019 education there and economic development was great, but in the southern area it was less than 20 percent, economic growth was very bad. And we see the same results all over, from Ethiopia to Nigeria to the Congo. Areas we have 40 percent or higher rates of girls\u2019 education, we have tremendous amount of development, and it\u2019s sustainable development, and it goes to other areas. So that\u2019s some of the things that we\u2019re looking at in these areas. And the same thing with Kenya and Nigeria as well. I hope that helps somewhat.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Our next question from Laura Koran with CNN. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you so much for doing the call. I\u2019m wondering what message we can expect to hear from the Secretary in terms of how he views the role that China plays on the continent, and particularly, what the U.S. is willing to offer to some of these countries to counter that growing influence in the coming years.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </b> Yeah. Okay. So here\u2019s an interesting point is that we, the United States, especially part in \u2013 by region. So in the Africa region, we are going to have a heart-to-heart discussion with the Chinese. We\u2019ve invited the Chinese to come to Washington to talk about their programs in Africa. And so on the one hand, the unhelpful role is the providing low-interest but really concessionary loans which really indebts the country. So for all of us who worked on HIPC \u2013 in other words, getting African countries post-colonial period off of debt \u2013 to see these countries re-indebted again is not only outrageous and terrible, but for us it\u2019s really just \u2013 I mean, we spent so much time getting them off of debt, and to see them to go back on debt is just terrible. And it goes back to not only corruption in some of these states, but also the ease in which not only China \u2013 and you\u2019re talking Russia, Iran, and other countries providing low-interest loans. And this is really kind of another forum of impoverishment and poverty, because it\u2019s \u2013 unlike HIPC, we can\u2019t really kind of repay loans back to banks, and so this is going to be a very tough issue to address.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issues aside too, though, is China builds things. We don\u2019t construct. And so in that regard China can play a helpful role. The other issue, too, is that China has some really good ideas on development in developing areas, such as how to do better healthcare, how to do water production. So those are things that are good. Also China did a good favor for us in Sudan, providing an engineer battalion to provide assistance to the UN operations there. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So when you look at China, it\u2019s a very complex relationship. We have a lot of areas and issues that we\u2019re in conflict, but the issue comes in is that we\u2019re trying to find the areas where we can build some type of support and cooperation that will be to the betterment of Africa. But one area that\u2019s not to the betterment is these loan rates, which is terrible. So we\u2019ve looked at countries, and we\u2019re doing data dumping. Some \u2013 a lot of countries in Southern Africa and parts of the east and west are having anywhere from 50 percent to in one case 200 percent of GDP debt. And 80 percent and 50 percent are probably Chinese loans, and that\u2019s really not acceptable, and that\u2019s an area that we really need to address and focus on.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So when you said \u201ccountering China,\u201d I think the better word is probably how are we going to resolve tensions, problems. How can we make China much more supportive of the overall development of Africa. Because what we don\u2019t want to see is \u2013 let\u2019s say, for instance, Congo, which is very rich in resources \u2013 where you see Russia, China, North Korea, Iran taking out resources, yet the Congolese don\u2019t receive very much in benefits. How do you resolve that? How do you develop, how do you get these countries to really benefit from the resources that they have, yet at the same time these countries such as China, Russia, Iran is also developing but also they give back a lot to the Africans? And that\u2019s an issue and a question we need to pursue during this trip over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> We have a question from Nike Ching with Voice of America. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much for doing this phone call. It\u2019s really appreciated. My question is regarding the political development in Africa. Twenty countries in Africa are holding national elections in 2018, which include Chad and Djibouti\u2019s national assembly elections. And separately, we saw the state of emergency in Ethiopia, and in Kenya a demand for greater diversity in the presidential cabinet. Now, my question for you is given the history of unrest in Ethiopia and other place, in the U.S. vision, what is a genuine inclusive political process look like in those countries? And in your assessment, what should those governments do to improve press freedom and human rights? Thank you very much.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> And thank you, Nike, and then I look forward \u2013 we look forward to seeing you next week as well.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So the issue right now is \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely correct. Over two decades ago, we were looking at the number of really democratically elected countries, and it was really very few. It\u2019s only three or four or so. But now we have over two dozen, which means those are two dozen countries which are not going to have transitions in government through coup d\u2019etats and illegal methods, et cetera, we hope. Now, obviously, a lot of those countries are fragile democracies and we\u2019re trying to strengthen them, but look at the most recent elections in Liberia \u2013 so the first really free, open, fair, and peaceful transition of governments in over 75 years, and that\u2019s a good thing. And really, after the horrendous rule of Charles Taylor and the degradation of the institutions there, but now we\u2019ll going back and they\u2019re building, and I think with the election of George Weah that\u2019s going to be a positive thing.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And you see the same thing in \u2013 with Akufo-Addo in Ghana and Ouattara in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Macky Sall in Senegal. So you see a lot of developments. And as we look at the 20 elections, obviously Nigeria, though it\u2019s not this year \u2013 it\u2019s going to be next year \u2013 that really is a major priority focus, because that\u2019s going to be the third most populous country in the world by 2050. And it has really very complex political issues and ethnic and tribal issues and security issues, and that\u2019s an area that we really are focusing on how to do a peaceful transition, a democratic transition, but more important is how to hold governments accountable to the people.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Now, you raised Ethiopia, and that is \u2013 remains a challenge for us and a focus for us as well and an opportunity, because we\u2019re looking at trying to build institutions, really strengthen institutions, and also have peaceful transitions and hold governments accountable to the people. We\u2019re looking at how we can have reconciliation and dialogues between all of the different groups \u2013 the Oromos, the Amharas, the Tigrays, and also in Kenya with the opposition and with the ruling government. And so those are some of the things that certainly during this trip are going to be the subjects of discussion, is how do we do these \u2013 building strong institutions, holding governments accountable? How do we advance political and economic reform that will help in the transition process? Those are issues too that we\u2019re working in Zimbabwe with the transition between Mugabe and Mnangagwa, and also we\u2019re looking hopefully at South Africa with the election of Ramaphosa from Zuma and seeing how that\u2019s going to transition. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And \u2013 so we\u2019re very hopeful. We\u2019re very high on Africa, and let me just give you one factoid that\u2019s very interesting: So we were doing some data crunching, and in the early days \u2013 in the \u201980s and \u201990s \u2013 we were looking at 19 evacuations of some country around the world. And evacuations are full evacuations or partial, and Africa had its fair \u2013 fair number. But if you look at the last couple years, actually, the number of evacuations or countries in crisis really are not in Africa. We had, like, four in the last year and a half. We\u2019ve had, I think, it\u2019s like eight or so in the last couple years, three years. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those numbers in Africa look really good. I mean, you still have the problems of DRC and Sudan, which really grab the press; but overall, across the continent, it\u2019s pretty good, it looks really good. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do is: How do we build on it? How do we boost stability? How do we do security? How do we build institutions? And so those are the things that this trip is going to try to highlight, and it\u2019s going to be really a start, a dialogue, that we can really work with our African partners to achieve. Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR: </b>We have a question from Simon Ateba with Today News Africa. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Yes, thank you. The president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, says there cannot be business without peace. And as you know, yesterday Boko Haram killed several UN humanitarian workers and also kidnapped hundreds of student last week. Will Secretary Tillerson, will he propose any new cooperation with Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon in the fight against Boko Haram, or will this be only about business? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And finally, why didn\u2019t the Secretary go to Cameroon since the U.S. has hundreds of troops in Cameroon fighting Boko Haram? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </b>Yeah, those are very \u2013 they were very good questions, and thank you. And just kind of starting out last, the Secretary\u2019s trip, this is his initial trip to Africa. He\u2019s going to come back again, and we are going to look at Cameroon, we\u2019re going to look at South Africa, we\u2019re going to look at other countries. Of course, with South Africa, with the transition to Ramaphosa, we were kind of saying, well, probably this is a very critical country for the U.S., but I think it\u2019s once the government is established and set, I think then we\u2019ll probably go there.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But Cameroon, yes. Cameroon raises an issue, but so does Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali. And so there\u2019s a lot of countries, and which countries do we head to? So on Nigeria, this is really a really important issue, and I know that in the last administrations, even the last three, we have always said going to Nigeria is critical to stability and the future for the U.S. relationship in West Africa. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So on Nigeria, you really raised really good points, is that \u2013 so we are following the recent kidnappings of 110 school girls, which really kind of follows up on several years ago of the Chibok girls. And those are horrendous, they\u2019re unacceptable, terrible, and how do you do security? But the issue that comes in, it\u2019s not only a security issue \u2013 and it is a terrible security challenge \u2013 but it\u2019s also political issues and really building those institutions and political dialogue between north and south, and also with the region. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those are some of the things that we need to look at. It\u2019s a comprehensive approach. The other issue, too, is on economic development and education. So looking at the UN, we have fresh UN reports about some of the extremist operations in the G5 countries, the Trans-Sahel, is for some of these groups it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s about getting jobs, it\u2019s about looking at getting an income for families. And if terrorism or trafficking of persons, if that\u2019s going to get them the jobs, then that\u2019s unacceptable and we really need to find alternative ways to help the economic development in these regions. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so those are some of the issues and challenges that we\u2019ll be working on is political institutions, political dialogue, reconciliation, supporting community-based development, helping growth, education. And then on the other hand, as you said, is the security, particularly in the north, and how do you enhance security. And it just can\u2019t be constantly a kinetic strike operation or bring in U.S. military. That\u2019s not the answer. The answer has to be developing institutions and also providing good police training, military training, and having governments accountable to the people and having people really have faith in their institutions, and also having opportunities for job creation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And what happens in Nigeria is going to affect the Lake Chad region, and that includes Cameroon as well as the G5 countries. So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at, much more broad-based, comprehensive, and really interrelated with security. Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR: </b>And we have a question from Michele Kelemen with NPR. Please, go ahead.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thanks. I wondered \u2013 just following up on Nike\u2019s question \u2013 how the Secretary plans to navigate the political turmoil in Ethiopia. Is he going to have any meetings with opposition figures or former political prisoners, and what messages he has to the government there? And then while we have you, you have any reaction to what happened in Burkina today?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah. So those are very good points, and in Ethiopia, again, it\u2019s \u2013 is to reaffirm that we\u2019re committed to the continued institutional development, and that we are looking \u2013 everyone\u2019s looking at how they conduct this transition from Haile Mariam, who belongs to really a minority group in southern Ethiopia. And there\u2019s a lot of rumors on who might be \u2013 it could be an Oromo or it could be another group. But whatever it is, is that the process really is going to bring all these various ethnic groups and regional groups and other political parties into the room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Again, the Secretary\u2019s trip is very short, and so that means there\u2019s going to be a follow-up. So obviously, after the Secretary\u2019s ministerial last year, we all went on \u2013 all over Africa to kind of follow up. I went on a 15-day, 10-country trip. I\u2019ll be going out after the Secretary\u2019s trip again to this region. And it\u2019s not just \u2013 Michele, not only just the interrelating with the Oromo and the Amhara groups, but again, community leaders, women-based groups, opposition. Yes, the people in prison, that remains a concern. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re addressing. But also regional issues \u2013 relationships with Eritrea, looking and supporting the Ethiopian negotiations with \u2013 in South Sudan, and also their troops in Somalia.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So it\u2019s going to be an initial discussion. There\u2019s going to be follow-up and a lot of discussions. And even now, before the Secretary\u2019s gone out there, I\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve all spoken to the leadership. Our ambassador, Michael Raynor, and his team are doing a fabulous job really reaching out and just setting up the base for a discussion. And we\u2019re going to follow up, and this is going to be a long-term process. And it\u2019s not just Ethiopia. It\u2019s Kenya, it\u2019s South Africa, it\u2019s Zimbabwe, and it\u2019s Nigeria.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Going to your second question, is on Burkina Faso. We\u2019re still getting a lot of information that is \u2013 that\u2019s troubling. Burkina Faso is a focal country for our G5 operations. The $60 million that was committed by Secretary Tillerson, about 30 million is going to go to Burkina Faso for military training and security training, but also we\u2019re looking at all different communities. Burkina Faso is a very diverse community. It has a large Christian community \u2013 it actually has Catholics, has a number of Catholic bishops. It has a Muslim population. And it\u2019s looked on as being much more relatively calmer than the other states. But I think this attack on the French military, the local military bases, that raises concerns. We\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019re still getting assessments as this comes in, and it\u2019s still a very fluid situation. But it does raise concerns.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Any follow-up? Over.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. It\u2019ll be just a moment for our next question. One moment, please. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah. Oh, hello. Any more questions?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> I think there are a few. I think we have time for maybe one more.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>OPERATOR:</b> Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Rosiland Jordan with Al Jazeera English. Your line is open.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing the call. Three quick questions. One: Will there be any discussions with any of the governments about refugee outflows, particularly to EU countries and possibly on to the United States? Any possible ideas to try to deal with that problem? </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Number two: Is there any reason, or was it ever considered, that the Secretary might try to visit Somalia in order to show visceral support for President Farmajo? There\u2019s a lot of talk about supporting the Somali security forces, but what about supporting the actual government in Mogadishu?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And then finally, regarding Nigeria and Chad and the G5 Sahel situation, what specific conversations will there be about trying to deal with radical Islamic groups that have pledged their fealty to ISIL and who are wreaking political havoc, particularly in West Africa? Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Okay, very good \u2013 great point. So going back to the refugee flows \u2013 and that is \u2013 that remains foremost in a lot of \u2013 in our minds, et cetera. As you know, the whole refugee flows \u2013 we\u2019re looking at approaching 10 million refugees in all of Africa. But I think we also should not forget the number of internally displaced, which is probably approaching around 12 million. And the two countries that are of highest concerns is South Sudan and the DRC, and those are two countries that will be under discussion, as the Secretary visits the African Union. And also with Ethiopia, which is leading the high-level discussions in \u2013 with South Sudan and Salva Kiir. So that does remain, but also the internally displaced.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The other issue too is, as you said, on Somalia. Somalia remains a very critical issue, but where the Secretary goes, I think what he announced obviously open to \u2013 subject to change, but right now, what he announced yesterday, those are the countries he\u2019s visiting for now. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>But what you raise on Somalia is a point. So I\u2019ve worked in Somalia quite a number of times since the last \u2013 since Black Hawk Down. I was just there recently. We are looking and working very closely with the TCCs of the AMISOM troops and also the countries that are \u2013 the African troops and the African Union, also the UN envoys working on Somalia. But again, it\u2019s more than just security. It is a security issue, but it\u2019s also a political will issue about, as we have said to President Farmajo, is working with the six other regional leaders and also working on institution building and also working eventually to a one-person, one-vote, which we hope will be by 2024 or 2028. So that will be \u2013 continue to be a high point of interest for not only the Secretary, but for the U.S. Government.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Then going back to Nigeria, so again, that is a challenge \u2013 the ISIS-West Africa, Boko Haram, and also the \u2013 where these groups are emanating from Nigeria to Lake Chad area and to the G5 countries. But the question comes in is \u2013 we continue to assess the changing and the evolving relationship. We look at the recent UNDP report which said that 71 percent of people who are radicalized in Africa were radicalized because of the abuse by the security sector in their own country. So that means that we need to do a lot more on security reform, training, institution building, democratic values, accountability to eliminate those \u2013 and the other area too is on job creation and economic, so building economic issues.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And so when you say a lot of groups are claiming allegiance to al-Qaida or ISIS or whatever, we\u2019re seeing in some instances where these are aspirational, other areas of opportunities, but the other issue too is that it\u2019s economic in nature as well. So it\u2019s very complex as things that we\u2019re still looking at very carefully, and really how to address it. And those are issues that \u2013 it\u2019s not just Nigeria. It goes across the Trans-Sahel and it goes all the way down to Somalia. And then we look at how is it that \u2013 what do we need to do as the United States in our partnership with Africa and the African Union to really build stability so that they don\u2019t have these organizations and groups. And one of the things that we point to is the DRC in Eastern Congo, where you have a proliferation of these groups which have become extraordinarily violent, and a lot of it is due to the political instability, insecurity, and not knowing about the next electoral process in the DRC, which we\u2019re trying to push towards December of this year.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at, but again, it\u2019s complex, no easy answers, and I think we probably need to have a much more in-depth discussion. Over. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I\u2019m sorry we weren\u2019t able to take every single call, but we really appreciate you calling in. And you can follow up with the \u2013 you can contact the press office if you have follow-ups. And with that, we\u2019ll end today\u2019s teleconference. And thanks, [Senior State Department Officials].</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</b> Yeah, and thank you very much. Thank you very much. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for being with us today for a very, very special presentation. I\u2019m honored to welcome our Secretary of State to George Mason, who, as you know, is on his way to a very important trip to Africa. And I\u2019m slightly biased, but I think his choice of George Mason for this presentation couldn\u2019t be any better.\n\n\n<p>\n\tGeorge Mason is the home to students and faculty from over 130 countries, and we have made it as part of our mission to make sure that we are educating students to engage in a very interconnected world. We sometimes define ourselves as wanting to be a university for the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Tillerson, who\u2019s now beginning his second year on the job, obviously, who was not a politician or a government person by training, and yet there are aspects of his career when you think about it make him absolutely perfect for this job assignment. You know that he ran ExxonMobil for a number of years, since 2006 until 2017. You know that Exxon is one of the largest publicly-held companies in the world and one of the most global companies. So yeah, it is pretty intimidating to run the State Department with over 44,000 employees, plus another 44,000 local employees all over the world, and a $50-plus billion budget. But that\u2019s actually smaller than what he used to run when he was at the helm of ExxonMobil. Plus he has spent a lot of time around the world running operations in the Middle East and in many other parts of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMost importantly, I think for this job, is that he was an Eagle Scout. And being a Boy Scout not only prepared him very well, but it marked him so much that he decided to serve the organization. And his \u2013 he served as president of the Boy Scouts of America for a number of years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo again, on behalf of the Mason community and without much more to say, just please join me in welcoming our Secretary of State, Mr. Rex Tillerson. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Thank you. Thank you so much, Dr. Cabrera, for the warm welcome. And it is a pleasure to be here at George Mason, and I\u2019m pleased always to meet a Fulbright alum, as well as a fellow engineer. And we appreciate George Mason University hosting the African and African American Studies program here and for the work it does on many, many important topics that we\u2019ll be discussing this morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLater today I will be leaving on my first official visit to Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 not my first visit to Africa, as I made many, many trips and many visits during my past career, but it\u2019s a trip that really began its planning and originated back in November following a ministerial of 37 African nations and the African Union hosted at the State Department. Our conversation during that summit focused on counterterrorism, democracy and governance issues, and strengthening trade and investment ties with the continent \u2013 and these are all themes that I\u2019ll address in a moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I said, in my previous life, I spent quite a bit of time in Africa. And my firm belief is that there is ample opportunity on the continent \u2013 for economic growth, for greater prosperity, and for responding to global challenges through mutually respectful partnerships. I do look forward to returning and building on a strong foundation of U.S.-Africa relations. And that includes visiting Chad, a country that has never before welcomed a visit by the Secretary of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver the past century, as African nations emerged from their colonial past, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in America\u2019s engagement with Africa. The State Department created the Africa Bureau in 1958 \u2013 a year following then-Vice President Richard Nixon\u2019s trip to the continent. Ghana had invited the Vice President and Martin Luther King, Jr. to attend their independence day celebration \u2013 an event that took place exactly 61 years ago today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few years later, President John F. Kennedy established USAID with an eye toward African development, and our first Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Ghana and Tanzania. Forty years ago this month, President Jimmy Carter visited Liberia and Nigeria, where he announced that \u201cour nation has now turned in an unprecedented way toward Africa.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday that turning continues. Our country\u2019s security and economic prosperity are linked with Africa\u2019s like never before. That will only intensify in the coming decades for the following reasons:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst: A major demographic shift. By the year 2030, Africa will represent about one quarter of the world\u2019s workforce. And by the year 2050, the population of the continent is expected to double to more than 2.5 billion people \u2013 with 70 percent of them under the age of 30.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second: Africa is experiencing significant economic growth. The World Bank estimates that six of the ten fastest growing economies in the world this year will be African.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor context, by the year 2050, Nigeria will have a population larger than the United States and an economy larger than Australia\u2019s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo understand where the world is going, one must understand that Africa is a significant part of the future. African countries will factor more and more into numerous global security and development challenges, as well as expansive opportunities for economic growth and influence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile Africa contains a wealth of diversity \u2013 among its peoples, its cultures, and its governments \u2013 there are common challenges and opportunities. Africa\u2019s vitality is reflected in its youth, but a growing population of young people means a requirement for more jobs. As more Africans move out of poverty, nations will require more infrastructure and development. The growing population of young people, if left without jobs and a hope for the future, will create new ways for terrorists to exploit the next generation, subverting stability and derailing democratic governments. Leaders will be challenged to innovate and to manage the limited financial resources they have.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we look ahead, this administration seeks to deepen our partnership with Africa, with an aim of making African countries more resilient and more self-sufficient. That serves our partners, and it serves the United States as well by creating a stable future for all of our children and our grandchildren.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe future of stability is dependent on security \u2013 the condition that is necessary for economic prosperity and strong institutions. Without it, none of the other pieces can be put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the long reach of terrorism threatens to steal the future of countless individuals. This August, we will remember the hundreds of lives lost 20 years ago in the U.S. embassy attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam \u2013 where hundreds of lives ended.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSince that day, thousands more have died at the hands of terrorists in Africa. Terrorist attacks rose from less than 300 in 2009, to more than 1,500 in each of the years 2015, 2016, and \u201917. And more recently, we witnessed again the heartbreak of the abduction of more than 100 Nigerian schoolgirls \u2013 ripped from their families, forever changing their future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast week, in response to this growing threat, I designated and the United States sanctioned seven ISIS-affiliated groups, including ISIS-West Africa and ISIS-Somalia and their leaders in an effort to cut off the resources that these groups use to carry out attacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo prevail against such evil forces, the United States has committed to working with African partners to rid the continent and the world of terrorism by addressing the drivers of conflict that lead to radicalization and recruitment in the first place, and building the institutional law enforcement capacity of African nations. We want to help Africa states provide security for their citizens in a lawful manner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday African nations are stepping up to take action, including the sacrifices that go with such commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTerrorism knows no borders. In the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram, ISIS-West Africa, al-Qaida in the Maghreb and other groups are adaptable, they\u2019re resilient, and capable of launching attacks throughout the area. Regional cooperation is crucial to disrupting those attacks and denying them the capability to plan and carry them out in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Multinational Joint Task Force \u2013 created by Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Benin, and Cameroon \u2013 along with the Group of Five Sahel nations, or the G5 \u2013 Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger \u2013 are pooling expertise and resources. Their work is instrumental in achieving African-led solutions to terrorism and instability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast October, I announced that the United States would contribute more to these regional efforts. We committed up to $60 million toward the G5\u2019s counterterrorism efforts \u2013 to enable them to train and equip members of the Joint Force and counter terrorist propaganda throughout these communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition, for more than a decade, the United States has supported the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership to provide training and promote cooperation between military, law enforcement, and civil actors across North and West Africa. We have deployed a similar approach in East Africa, with the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism, or PREACT. Since 2016, the United States has contributed more than $140 million to help partners prevent terrorist safe havens and the recruitment through these partnerships.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is grateful for the African Union\u2019s leadership in a growing, multilateral role. The AU Mission in Somalia \u2013 or AMISOM \u2013 includes troops from five African countries, stabilizing areas under attack from al-Shabaab and permitting much needed aid to reach the Somali people. I look forward to meeting with AU Commission Chairperson Faki on my upcoming trip to explore more ways in which we can work together to counter terrorism on the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States\u2019 role in these and other regional and multilateral efforts is to build capacity \u2013 not dependency \u2013 so our partners can provide for their own security. That\u2019s true of our approach to peacekeeping on the continent as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the largest contributor of peacekeeping capacity-building in Africa, the United States trains, deploys, and sustains forces that provide counterterrorism support, remove landmines, and facilitate peaceful transitions of power. This creates security, allows health \u2013 excuse me \u2013 allows health, food, and other services to reach areas of need.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast year, the United States supported more than 27,000 African peacekeepers from over 20 African countries. Here too more African countries have taken ownership of their future. A decade ago, Africans made up only about 20 percent of peacekeeping forces on the continent. Today that number exceeds 50 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we support important security efforts, we must work to find long-term diplomatic solutions to conflicts that cause so much human suffering. Until we do, the United States, as the world\u2019s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, will continue to stand with those most vulnerable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a testament to that commitment, today I\u2019m announcing $533 million in additional humanitarian assistance to fight famine and food insecurity and address other needs resulting from conflicts in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Lake Chad Basin. The alarming levels of hunger in these areas are largely man-made, as conflicts erupt and people flee their homes. Under these conditions, people cannot produce crops and often lose access altogether to food, education, and health care. Many lose everything. And regrettably, Mother Nature can still be cruel, such as in the Horn of Africa, where a prolonged drought is contributing to grave food insecurity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese additional funds will provide emergency food, nutrition assistance, and other aid, including safe drinking water, thousands of tons of food, and deliver health programs to prevent the spread of deadly diseases like cholera to millions of people. This will save lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe American people, as we always have been, are there to partner with African countries to ensure their most vulnerable populations receive life-saving assistance. We also call upon others to join us in meeting the growing humanitarian needs in Africa. We hope these initial contributions will encourage others to contribute aid to increase burden sharing and meet the growing humanitarian needs in Africa. However, this assistance will not solve these ongoing conflicts, but only buy us time \u2013 time to pursue diplomatic solutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs many African countries assume greater responsibility to address their needs at home, the United States needs our partners in Africa to take an active role on the global stage as well. One area where we seek greater cooperation is our peaceful pressure campaign to bring the DPRK to the negotiating table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNorth Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, including its arms exports to Africa. It doesn\u2019t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia. It doesn\u2019t just include countries with longstanding ties to the DPRK, like China and Russia. This is and must be a global effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast month, during my trip to South America, I spoke candidly with my counterparts about ways they are actively working to contribute to this pressure campaign. Nations in Africa need to do more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAngola and Senegal have taken steps to exert some diplomatic and economic pressure. The Ethiopian Government has made public commitments of support as well. But many African nations are holding back. We hope they will add their voices to that of the international community and end these diplomatic, economic, or weapons programs with the regime in North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecurity on the continent is a prerequisite for greater prosperity. And greater stability will, of course, attract greater United States trade and investment with African nations, leading to further development, building on what we have accomplished through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAGOA has been the cornerstone of U.S. trade policy in Africa for almost two decades now. And with AGOA, we\u2019ve seen a lot of progress. Total non-oil goods trade has more than doubled from $13 billion a year to almost $30 billion a year. In fact, last year, total U.S. trade climbed to $38.5 billion, up from $33 billion in 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re encouraged by the actions of many of our African partners who are seeking ways to expand trade with the United States. On his trip to the United States last week, President Akufo-Addo of Ghana addressed the National Governors Association, the first African president to do so. He talked about his desire \u2013 his people\u2019s desire \u2013 to transition from poverty to prosperity in a generation. The United States wants to help enable the public and private sectors in Africa and here at home to make that a reality.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfrica still has vast, undeveloped natural resources. Private sector expertise in the United States can facilitate the responsible development of those resources, helping bring more Africans out of poverty to share in the economic values of those resources. But significant transcontinental infrastructure is necessary to support the development, spur economic growth, and boost intraregional trade on the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday only about 12 percent of total African exports are delivered to their neighboring countries on the continent. Compare that to 25 percent among ASEAN countries and more than 60 percent in Europe, and the potential for more economic prosperity through trade on the continent itself is quite evident. As African nations achieve greater regional integration through lowering tariff barriers and improving transport, energy, and infrastructure links, that will create more opportunities for U.S. businesses, investment, and transatlantic trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd importing American business practices and expertise provides the best combination for Africa\u2019s future by contributing to economic prosperity, equipping African nations with new capabilities, and doing so in an open, transparent framework. That is why we want to create the new development finance institution. DFIs are specialized government banks designed to support private sector development to improve development effectiveness. We\u2019re working with Congress to give the United States the ability to compete with countries that already utilize finance to achieve their goals in the developing world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPower Africa, a USAID-led program, is one of the largest public-private partnerships in the continent\u2019s development history. Established five years ago, Power Africa was created to provide African countries access to one of the most basic needs for development: electricity. Today tens of millions of Africans \u2013 across Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 have access to electricity in part because of commitments from more than 140 private sector partners. Our aim is to provide 30,000 megawatts of power by the year 2030 \u2013 or 60 million new connections \u2013 to reach 300 million Africans. Administrator Green announced Power Africa 2.0 just last week to expand even more power opportunities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is eager to reduce barriers to trade and investment with our African partners, helping African countries transition from dependency toward self-sufficiency, growing their middle class, and better integrating African economies with the rest of the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo prepare for the future and realize the continent\u2019s potential requires an educated and a healthy workforce. This is true all over the world, but it takes on even more urgency, given Africa\u2019s expanding youth population.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Young Africans Leaders Initiative is one way the State Department and USAID are investing in the next generation of African leaders. YALI provides leadership and professional development training to up-and-coming African leaders on the importance of a free press, how to build more resilient institutions, and even how to start a business. Today, YALI has over 500,000 members and representatives from every Sub-Saharan country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThrough the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, better known as PEPFAR, the United States has transformed the global HIV/AIDS response. And nowhere is this more evident than in Africa.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen PEPFAR began 15 years ago, an HIV diagnosis was a death sentence. In the hardest-hit parts of Africa, infant mortality had doubled, child mortality had tripled, and life expectancy had dropped by 20 years. One in three adults were living with HIV. Millions of orphans were left behind. And only 50,000 people were receiving HIV treatments. Today, the American people, through PEPFAR, have provided lifesaving treatments to over 13.3 million men, women, and children. It has allowed more than 2.2 million babies to be born HIV-free and continues to support more than 6.4 million orphans, vulnerable children, and their caregivers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis administration is committed to saving lives in Africa. Last September, I announced the PEPFAR Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control for 2017 to 2020. The strategy is a roadmap to achieve epidemic control in more than 50 countries within three years. It outlines a path to accelerate our work in 12 high-HIV-burden countries in Africa who are poised to achieve epidemic control by 2020. We can actually now see a future free of HIV/AIDS. It\u2019s just ahead of us, and that\u2019s critical to Africa\u2019s future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor security, trade and investment, and economic development to sustain itself requires effective and accountable government institutions that earn the trust and support of their citizens. Peace and prosperity are only possible in a democratic society. Media freedom, open communications, religious freedom, and a vibrant civil society foster creativity, ideas, and the human energy for economic growth. Today, Africa has much to gain by creating stronger, more transparent, democratic institutions that reflect their citizens\u2019 voices, that reject corruption, and protect and promote human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe African Union estimates that Africa has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to corruption \u2013 hundreds of billions that was not invested in education, infrastructure, or security. Bribes and corruption keep people in poverty. They encourage inequality and they undercut the citizens\u2019 faith in their own government. Legitimate investment stays away, and insecurity and instability grows, creating conditions ripe for terrorism and conflict. We strongly support the African Union\u2019s summit\u2019s highlighting and encouraging efforts on \u201cWinning the Fight Against Corruption.\u201d We hope this year\u2019s theme is only the beginning of a more sustained, long-term focus on anti-corruption.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn support of this theme, the United States will continue its work with African countries to strengthen their democratic institutions. Last month, the State Department requested $137 million from Congress to support democracy, human rights, and government programs to create more transparent, less corrupt institutions that value consensus building over conflict.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDemocracy requires transitions of power through free and fair elections. It also needs a vibrant civil society and independent media to help inform citizens and keep them connected to their government. Last year, the United States helped support free and peaceful elections in Liberia, a country that hadn\u2019t experienced a peaceful transition of power in decades. That included civic and voter education programs with a focus on youth, women, and other hard-to-reach, first-time voters, and working with media to promote responsible reporting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the Fiscal Transparency Initiative Fund<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> helps governments create more transparent, publicly available budgets, and equips civil society to advocate for areas of improvement. The United States is currently working on 31 projects \u2013 and is about to award nine more \u2013 throughout Africa. Already, the Financial Transparency Initiative Fund<a name=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> has helped Kenya, Chad, and Malawi develop measures to fight bribery and better serve their own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also keep good governance initiatives in mind when it comes to development. As Secretary of State, I am chairman of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, or MCC. Through this agency designed to reduce poverty, the United States is able to incentivize good governance \u2013 including greater transparency \u2013 by tying it to development assistance. And about 60 percent of MCC\u2019s funding goes to Africa. Last November, we signed a $524 million compact with Cote d\u2019Ivoire to improve its education and transportation sectors. This was only possible after the country had implemented policies to strengthen economic freedom, democratic principles, human rights, and to fight corruption. Spurring reforms before a dollar of U.S. taxpayer money is even spent is the MCC\u2019s model.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s an American model of development that has proven itself to work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States pursues, develops sustainable growth that bolsters institutions, strengthens rule of law, and builds the capacity of African countries to stand on their own two feet. We partner with African countries by incentivizing good governance to meet long term security and development goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis stands in stark contrast to China\u2019s approach, which encourages dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them their long-term, self-sustaining growth. Chinese investment does have the potential to address Africa\u2019s infrastructure gap, but its approach has led to mounting debt and few, if any, jobs in most countries. When coupled with the political and fiscal pressure, this endangers Africa\u2019s natural resources and its long-term economic political stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe welcome other countries\u2019 involvement in the development of Africa; in fact, it is needed. That\u2019s what the free market is all about, competition leading to more opportunities. But we want to see responsible development and transparent free market practices that foster greater political stability on the continent. We hope China will join us in this effort as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States sees a bright future in Africa. We have an opportunity to be part of Africa\u2019s journey to a stable, prosperous future for its people. Each of these priorities \u2013 trade and investment, good governments \u2013 governance, respect for human rights, combatting terrorism and instability \u2013 have the same guiding principle in mind: to help African countries build the capacity to take care of their own people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are no quick fixes to these challenges, but the United States is committed to meeting them in partnership with nations of Africa so that the continent can increasingly become a place of prosperity and freedom in the 21st century. Thank you for your very kind attention. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I\u2019ve been collecting a few questions from the audience, some from the faculty, some from students, so I\u2019m going to maybe follow a little bit of a --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Go to the hard ones from the students.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: -- </strong>(inaudible). Since you insist, here\u2019s one. So the first one is maybe more of a personal nature, which is the reasons that led you to accept this position. As I mentioned earlier, you were leading one of the \u2013 really the largest companies that the world has ever seen, and not only that, you were CEO. You were your own boss. I mean, you had a board, but you were your own boss, and all of a sudden, why do this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I was within three months of mandatory retirement. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>That helps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>But I had \u2013 this was not in my retirement plans. I thought I was going to the ranch to spend more time with the life that I love and with my grandchildren. But the President-elect asked me to do this, and as I thought about it, this is \u2013 I\u2019ve told this story to a few other audiences, and it is how I got to the decision. When I was 18 years old, at that time we still had a mandatory military draft. It was the Vietnam War. And I registered for the draft, and they had a lottery system whereby people were selected. You got a number, and they pulled numbers until they met their draft quotas. And they got within three of my number my freshman year of college, and the year came and went, and my number was 89, they got to 86. And so I stayed in college, got a great education, got hired by a great company, had 41 and a half wonderful years, a dream career I never could have hoped for. My father is a veteran, World War II, fought in the war in the Pacific. My uncle is a retired major in the Army, did three tours of duty in Vietnam. And as I reflected on things at that point, I said I hadn\u2019t really done anything yet. It\u2019s my time to serve, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>Thank you for that. Now, you went to Texas at Austin, joined Exxon, and you may or may not have anticipated how incredibly global your own career would end up being. I\u2019m guessing if you had known what was going to \u2013 what your life was going to be like, you would have maybe prepped yourself a little better. Some of the folks in the audience still have the chance to make choices --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>(Laughter.) Right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>-- about what they do with their years in college, and this is a favor I\u2019m asking you, because I\u2019m pushing our students to go abroad, and some of them still don\u2019t believe why they should. So help me \u2013 what is the best plug that you can make for why should students go abroad? And then the follow up to that is: When they go abroad, they decide to go, for reasons still surprise me, to the UK, to Italy \u2013 well, Spain is not surprising, it\u2019s an awesome place to visit. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA: </strong>So, why they should go to Africa, for example? So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </strong>Well, I think \u2013 in my first trip abroad I was a freshman in college, and I had an opportunity to travel to Peru. There had been a terrible earthquake, a big humanitarian disaster, two cities had been literally buried under thirty meters of a mountain that collapsed. And it led to a big flow of people out of the mountains into the edges of Lima and a terrible refugee camp was set up. So I went down to Peru on a five-day mission during the Christmas holiday to bring awareness to that situation, so that was my first opportunity. It had a tremendous impact on me because I hadn\u2019t \u2013 in fact, it was only the second time I had ever flown on an airplane. It was the first time I got a passport. And it was really the first time I had a connection to the world outside and realized how interconnected we are and how we\u2019re just all human beings trying to get through life, no matter where you are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think today the case for going abroad is even more compelling than at that time in my life, because all of you know the world has transformed so dramatically. The global \u2013 our economies have transformed so dramatically. Our own security has transformed so dramatically. And today, it is \u2013 it is all interconnected, and you simply cannot think about economic issues, you cannot think about security issues without thinking about them in a global context. And so, whether you\u2019re just continuing your journey and your education to expand your understanding of why you\u2019re spending the time hitting those books every night and writing those papers, it will completely change your perspective and understanding to go abroad and spend time in someone else\u2019s nation as the person that\u2019s not a citizen and see the life from their perspective, but also hear their perspective of how they look back at us. And it\u2019s \u2013 it will be probably the most valuable component of your education that you can put into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then beyond that, this is going to continue, this interconnectedness of the world. The world is \u2013 really is \u2013 while physically it\u2019s the same size as it was the day God created it, for us, the people who occupy the planet, it is getting smaller and smaller and it is getting smaller at an exponential rate. And your generation is going to have to deal with that, and it brings with it an entire new dimension of challenges my generation is only seeing the front edge of. And it\u2019s important \u2013 the earlier you begin to understand that and how to interact with it, the better prepared you\u2019ll be for that in the future. And besides all of that, I promise you it\u2019ll be exciting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd go to the hard places. Don\u2019t go to the easy places. Like I said, I went to Lima, Peru. I went out into the mountains and the jungles. It was quite an experience to see how people exist around the world. Go to the hard places. It\u2019ll change you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> Thank you, by the way. Appreciate that. We\u2019ll take that and use it. (Laughter.) The \u2013 so now you\u2019re \u2013 in preparing for this trip to Africa, you\u2019ve picked five countries. How much of that is your own choice and based on your own experience in those countries? How much of that is sort of kind of technical decisions from your team? And at the end, why? Why those five countries out of all the many choices?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it\u2019s \u2013 obviously, I wished I had two or three weeks, because there are many African nations that are important to us that I think a visit would be beneficial to the relationship. But we picked these five. We\u2019re going to Ethiopia. Ethiopia is the home of the African Union; that\u2019s where it is located, their headquarters. Ethiopia also a very longstanding, important partner with the U.S. We have a relationship with Ethiopia that spans more than a century now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to stop in on Djibouti, the Horn of Africa. Djibouti is that country that sticks out right into the narrow straits between Yemen, leading into the Red Sea up to the Suez Canal, a very critical trading route for the world\u2019s economy and a critical partner in securing that trading route.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to Kenya, a large, thriving country. It\u2019s really where PEPFAR has seen its greatest success, and it\u2019s also been an incubator for how we expanded PEPFAR over the years. So we have a longstanding partnership with Kenya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThen we\u2019re going to Chad \u2013 N\u2019Djamena, Chad \u2013 because Chad contributes the largest fighting force to the G5 Sahel and they have been crucial to our fight against terrorism in the Sahel and the success of what they\u2019re doing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then finally to Nigeria, the most populous nation on the African continent. Tremendous natural resources and tremendous capabilities to succeed as a nation. They\u2019re still on their journey to succeed, and they are going to be critical to not just the relationship the U.S. has with Africa, but Nigeria is going to be critical to how Africa succeeds as a continent. And I spoke about the need to integrate African economies more, trade more with the neighbors. I think too often the U.S. in its approach \u2013 it\u2019s all been about trading across the transatlantic corridor. We really need to promote African intercontinental trade. That\u2019s actually going to open more opportunities for American investment and participation. So Nigeria, big country, very important country to the future of the continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there \u2013 I\u2019d love \u2013 there are others I\u2019d love to go to. I\u2019ve traveled to North Africa, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be aware, but a lot of important countries in East Africa, South Africa, clearly, so obviously this won\u2019t be my last trip. I\u2019ll have to go back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> So you \u2013 as a CEO of ExxonMobil, of course you\u2019ve engaged, and I\u2019ve seen some of this. I\u2019ve been a partner in an earlier life in some of the work of how private companies can play significant role in development of the economies where you do business. Now, when I look at the proposed budget for \u201919, State Department is getting a pretty significant haircut, maybe a 25 percent cut, which I imagine is going to have to \u2013 it will force you to have to rely much more heavily on the private sector to achieve the diplomatic goals that you have. What are your thoughts about \u2013 are we going to see a bigger role in the private sector? And how do you bring them along?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Right. Well, first, on the budget itself \u2013 and that reduction\u2019s relative to 2017\u2019s budget because we\u2019re still waiting on an \u201918 final budget \u2013 but it also is a return to levels that are more historic for the State Department before the big run-up in the war against ISIS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut yes, what we will be doing \u2013 and I mentioned that, touched on it in my remarks \u2013 is we want to facilitate more public-private partnerships. And we have mechanisms to do that and we have procedures and we\u2019re putting in place some new financing ideas where we can help countries have access to financing so they can participate themselves in private sector investments as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is \u2013 I mean, our role really, I think the U.S. Government\u2019s role, are the things that I stressed in there: one, to help with stability and security because if you don\u2019t have stability and security, it\u2019s tough to attract investment, it\u2019s tough to educate people, it\u2019s tough to feed people, to provide the bridging assistance in food security, on health areas, because again, as I touched on, the future is the young people. We got to have healthy young people, educated young people coming up. And then help with rules-based systems, so work with governments to put better laws in place, promote good courts and justice systems, and that\u2019s what will lead to the eradication of corruption which has drained the continent of so much capacity in the past.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\u2019s our role. The direct investments, we\u2019re there to facilitate and we\u2019re there to help companies understand what the opportunities are. If they need our help navigating through the local rules and whatnot, we\u2019re there to help guide them through that. But it\u2019s really to create the conditions in these countries where U.S. businesses and others \u2013 European businesses, Chinese, others to the extent they\u2019re ready to participate under a rules-based system, they\u2019re attracted because they see the conditions are there to be successful or at least have the opportunity to be successful. There\u2019s no guarantees in life, and I learned that in the private sector. All I ever wanted was to understand the rules, that the rules weren\u2019t going to change, and I had an opportunity to be successful. If we failed at it, we\u2019ll accept that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> One last question. I\u2019m reading some nonverbal messages \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 from your team. But the role of women in the future of Africa and my hope that you carry a very, very strong message \u2013 I know this is not new to you. I am aware of the investments that ExxonMobil made in women entrepreneurship. We know the impact that it has when women are kept in school instead of given into marriage. We know the impact that women have in improving health and the quality of life in communities. Let us \u2013 help us understand what our message is going to be in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, it is something that I gained an appreciation for more than 20 years ago in the private sector, and largely because of investments and business activities that my previous life had in Africa, but also in emerging economies and emerging government systems, including Russia and \u2013 which I spent a lot of time in as well. And what I learned through studies, academic studies, but also my own experience is so much about creating these conditions that I\u2019ve talked about and so much about creating the conditions for people to thrive the way \u2013 and have a life like we enjoy is about breaking the cycle. And I was speaking earlier with the president of your student body about breaking the cycle and that we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re a generation away from breaking that cycle in Africa, but we have to stay at it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAn important element of that starts with women because it starts with mothers, and what we learned through our studies is that mothers \u2013 and probably this is true even here in this country, it was for me \u2013 mothers are the greatest influencers on how children are going to grow up \u2013 the values they hold, how they conduct themselves, and what they aspire to. And so first it\u2019s important that we support women\u2019s health first and their capacity to participate in the economic well-being of the country because too often we have women that are raising families without a lot of help from fathers. And so it starts with giving them capacity because they will raise better families.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut then secondly, putting women into not just the workforce, but the governance. They bring a very different perspective \u2013 and I see this in my private sector life, I saw it and I experienced it in the government sector as well \u2013 having a perspective brought that women bring, it\u2019s different from ours. I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not that we\u2019re bad, but we have gaps and we have blind spots and women fill those in for us. But I think it\u2019s as much about anything \u2013 this is how we break the generational cycle is by really empowering women to fully participate in all aspects of our human life as mothers, as participants in the economy, as entrepreneurs, as participants in government. That is what will ultimately transform the next generation of leaders. Both men and women will be transformed by that and it\u2019s particularly important in Africa. And part of this is the history and culture of Africa. We know it works because we\u2019ve seen it work. We\u2019ve seen it work in very distinct areas. We just have to grow it out now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it is crucial to, I think, the success of Africa creating a quality of life that we all want for people in the African continent. We want them to have the quality of life we have, and it\u2019s an important element of how we\u2019ll achieve that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR CABRERA:</strong> Mr. Secretary, we thank you again for coming to share that message with us, and most importantly for recognizing the huge importance that the African continent has for the rest of us, for carrying that message of economic development and opportunity, and for making Africa a priority. We wish you a productive and safe trip to Africa. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Thank you, and all the best to George Mason.

May we rise, please? I thank you very much. <i>Ameseginalehu</i>. Your Excellency Dr. Workneh Gebeyehu, foreign minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; Your Excellency Rex Wayne Tillerson, U.S. Secretary of State; ambassadors, ministers, all protocol observed, welcome to Addis Ababa, the political and diplomatic hub of Africa.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs His Excellency Minister Tillerson said during his speech at George Mason University, Africa is part of the future. It\u2019s a continent in which 70 percent of its population is youth. This population, Your Excellency, is an opportunity and, again, a challenge. Ethiopia, as a UN-U.S. partner and longer in the continent, I believe this extraordinary visit will further deepen the ties of Ethiopia and the United States, one of the oldest diplomatic ties.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAccording to our program, His Excellency Dr. Workneh and His Excellency Rex Tillerson will highlight the gist of their discussions to the media, and that will be followed by questions from media houses. Media houses, make sure that you have one questions. If it is more than one, the two principals will ask \u2013 will respond to one question only.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI thank you very much. Excellency Dr. Workneh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER WORKNEH: </b>Thank you very much. Thank you. Good afternoon. The house is full. Your Excellency Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State of the United States of America, we are delighted to have you here in your visit to Africa as a first stop here in Addis Ababa. United States and Ethiopia have a century-old relationship, a relationship which, time-tested, always a relationship.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Your Excellency, your coming here is a testament for this strong relationship. I and Excellency Secretary discussed extensive issues bilaterally. We discussed about our regional issues \u2013 the regional security, international issues, international politics \u2013 at the same time, how to boost our economic ties and investment between the United States of America and Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe touched about the issue of South Sudan and Somalia, which we are working very closely together. And also, we discussed other very important security concerns that we have in common. And also, I explained to Excellency about our situation, the country\u2019s situation, the transition that we are in the process, and we are very thankful that the United States of America is a close friend, which \u2013 working with us in all aspects, especially in economic areas. So it was very cordial, candid, and very fruitful discussion. And thank you so much, Your Excellency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, thank you as well, Excellency, for the warm welcome and hospitality. And we just had a very enjoyable lunch where we were able to continue our discussion with a number of members of both of our delegations, which is always useful to gain a greater understanding of each other. I also want to welcome both the local press and the foreign media as well to this event. And we do appreciate our partnership, and particularly at such a critical time for Ethiopia. I also look forward to my meeting later today with the prime minister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m quite excited to be in Ethiopia. This is my first visit, and certainly this was an important place to start my trip as Secretary of State to the continent, in large measure because of the more than 100-year diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and the United States. And it\u2019s been an enduring relationship; as the foreign minister described it, an all-weather relationship, that even when storm clouds gather we remain friends and have always worked through challenges together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also want to acknowledge again today this being International Women\u2019s Day and an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women across the world, and note the role of women in Ethiopia in promoting economic growth as well. It\u2019s quite evident the prominence that women already occupy in government, but in economics as well, strengthening the rule of law, the important role they play in human rights and building and strengthening a civil society that will thrive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs I indicated, the United States and Ethiopia are longstanding partners. I was glad to have the opportunity to exchange views with the foreign minister on many areas of mutual interest that we share. We recognize and share concerns expressed by the government about incidents of violence and loss of life. We do firmly believe the answer is greater freedom for people, not less. We recognize the transition that is underway in Ethiopia, the first-ever voluntary transfer of power. And I view this as a very positive symbol of the strength of this very young democracy in Ethiopia, a peaceful transition of power.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGiven recent events, the United States has expressed our concerns with the government\u2019s decision to impose another state of emergency, because it does put restrictions on fundamental rights like assembly and expression. We also discussed in our exchange the importance of ensuring that security forces remain disciplined in maintaining law and order, preventing violence. They have a very difficult challenge on their hand. This is \u2013 this tests their own discipline as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe firmly believe that democratic reform, economic growth, and lasting stability are best addressed through an inclusive political process, rather than through the imposition of restrictions. And we encourage the Ethiopian people as well to maintain patience, maintain support for your government through this change, through this transition, but also in pursuing this journey of democracy, which takes time and effort. Democracy is not easy. It takes a lot of work. But staying with it, lasting change will come about, and to not resort to violence. Violence is simply never a solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI was able to raise these concerns because of this very, very strong relationship that exists between Ethiopia and the United States, and we share so many values as partners. We want Ethiopia as a country to succeed and prosper, and we\u2019re confident that they will succeed and prosper, providing many, many economic benefits not just for the Ethiopian people, but for the neighboring countries in Africa, and ultimately for U.S. business interest as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe welcome the proactive steps that have already been taken with the release of thousands of prisoners, including journalists and political leaders, and we encourage additional concrete measures to allow greater political freedom of expression. As the seat of the African Union, Ethiopia plays a critical and significant role in leadership in the region throughout the continent and the world, and we appreciate its efforts for \u2013 to further our mutual goals of peace and prosperity on the continent. This is especially true of our shared security interests. As the largest contributor \u2013 Ethiopia is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations \u2013 they play a vital role in AMISOM in Somalia, as well as peacekeeping efforts in Sudan and South Sudan. We have shared treasure together in trying to advance the cause of peace, and we have shared blood together in this advance for the cause of peace, and we acknowledge that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEthiopia\u2019s influence in supporting the security of Somalia and Djibouti are particularly important at this time to keep global commerce routes open. These routes through the Red Sea affect billions of people around the world in terms of their economic stability. And we discussed the United States is eager to help Ethiopia liberalize its economy. We think it\u2019s going to bring great opportunity and attract many business interests as they continue the process of reform and liberalization, strengthen its judicial and commercial institutions, and assist in humanitarian emergencies here and throughout the region, including the almost one million refugees that currently reside in Ethiopia. And we need to reside \u2013 recognize Ethiopia\u2019s generosity in hosting those refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is a long-term friend and partner of Ethiopia. We look forward to working with you as the people of Ethiopia seek greater peace, democracy and prosperity, all of which we know you will succeed at achieving. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you so much, excellencies. Now, back to the media. Tibebu Yared from EBC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you very much. I am Tibebu from EBC. My question goes to Your Excellency Mr. Tillerson. What is the purpose and, of course, the implication of your visit to Ethiopia at this particular time? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>Well, as I indicated, this is a very, very longstanding relationship, more than 100 years. Ethiopia is a large-population country, they are an important security partner in areas that I\u2019ve already touched upon, and we also see Ethiopia\u2019s journey towards democracy \u2013 I think 27 years now, which is a long time, but it\u2019s a young democracy, and as I indicated, democracies are challenging. It\u2019s not easy to take a country forward as a democracy. And so we\u2019re here also to support Ethiopia\u2019s journey towards a democratic society and institutions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut importantly, also, to have an exchange on additional steps that could be taken, what else can the U.S. do to be supportive and helpful of Ethiopia\u2019s economic development. Ethiopia has a vibrant economy, but there\u2019s a lot of potential that has yet to be realized in Ethiopia\u2019s economy, and we think there are great opportunities for U.S. private sector engagement in supporting economic growth, creating jobs for these many, many millions of young people who are working hard at getting an education in school; now they want to have their opportunity for a future themselves. And so we would like \u2013 we want to be a part of that and hope to be a part of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there are so many touch points where we share a common interest of security, stability for the region, which affects our security but also affects global security, and then opportunities for economic prosperity. And that\u2019s the purpose of the trip, is to \u2013 for us to better understand how do we work together as partners to achieve what are really common aspirations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Next question, Sisay Woubeshet, Afro FM. I am trying to meet gender parity. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. My question also goes to Secretary Tillerson. You came during the time of the second state of emergency here in Ethiopia, and what is your opinion towards the state of emergency, as many nations are opining on that? And how is the U.S. following the current political situation in Ethiopia and what role does it want to play? Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Well, as I indicated, first and foremost, I want to acknowledge this voluntary transfer of power. We think that\u2019s a very powerful symbol to the strength of the democratic process here in Ethiopia, and we think it\u2019s important that the parliament, which has been elected by the Ethiopian people, decide who the next leadership be. That\u2019s the way democracies should perform.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I want to first acknowledge the very positive aspects of what is happening. I know it\u2019s challenging for the country. It creates uncertainty. And that is the hard part of democracy. But we support this peaceful transfer of power.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs to the state of emergency, as I indicated, we believe ultimately giving people greater freedom gives them a greater investment in this democracy as well. And so while we appreciate the government\u2019s responsibility to maintain control and not allow violence to break out and harm innocent people as well who may become victims of violence, it is important that that \u2013 that the country move on past the state of emergency as quickly as possible. We hope that that can occur. As I said, we\u2019re encouraged that a number of steps have been taken to release large numbers of people who have been detained. That\u2019s an important step. But the citizens of Ethiopia have a responsibility as well to behave in a nonviolent way, and we hope the government allows that nonviolent expression to take place. This is all part of understanding how to best serve the citizens of Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you very much. Girum Chala from CGTN, international correspondent based in Addis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. I\u2019m from CGTN. Mr. Minister, thank you very much, as well as Mr. Secretary. Ethiopian Airlines over the past few years has spent about $20 billion \u2013 that\u2019s Ethiopian money \u2013 invested in the United States, in Boeing Company, to be particularly straightforward. Now, when it comes to those \u2013 the money spent, 100,000-plus jobs were created in the United States. When it comes to the investments of the United States to Africa, Ethiopia particularly, we don\u2019t see much. Policy-wise, what\u2019s the next move in this country and particularly also in the African continent to expedite investment? And how do you view, Mr. Minister, the expectation from Ethiopia\u2019s side, the U.S. involvement in helping the country industrialize and even more trade internationally? Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</b> Well, we had a very robust discussion of economic opportunities and the potential economic opportunities that we see within Ethiopia. And because you mentioned the aviation connection, Ethiopia is becoming a critical hub for intercontinental traffic for people traveling from the United States, with more and more nonstop connections for Americans to travel to Addis Ababa and then make connections to other parts of the continent. I think this is going to promote a great deal of interest in Africa and in Ethiopia. There are still economic reform measures that are necessary, not just in Ethiopia, but in other parts of Africa as well, to lower some of the barriers to investment, create greater certainty to outside business investors, strong rule of law, good regulatory processes. The more privatization of holdings as possible creates opportunities. But we understand this is all part of governments in transitions, economies in transitions, but that\u2019s what we encourage, is what are the areas of opportunity where we believe there will be strong interest in U.S. companies to participate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI commented on, in our discussions, the what we understand soon-to-be-completed continental free trade agreement, and we believe stimulating intra-continental economic activity and trade from countries on the continent is actually going to create even more opportunity for inbound foreign investment, and certainly U.S. business interest, in wanting to be a part of the intra-continental trading system as well. Similarly, with the civil aviation agreement that\u2019s being negotiated through the African Union. That once again is going to just tie the continent more closely together, more efficiently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these are very positive conditions for outside businesses to want to participate and be a part of. So I think a number of very positive steps are being taken, and I think it\u2019s really ensuring that American businessmen and investors understand what are the opportunities here. And we had discussions about how to do that as well. Recently creating an American Chamber of Commerce-Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce partnership is going to be very important to exposing American businesses to the opportunities here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think there\u2019s a lot of it in front of us yet to come, and as the conditions are created and some of these pieces come into place, I think American business and private sector interest is going to grow in Ethiopia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>FOREIGN MINISTER WORKNEH: </b>Yeah. As Secretary has said, the issue of investment and trade is also one of the agendas that we have discussed with Secretary Tillerson. Africa is a future continent, as Secretary said, and Africa is a population who have more than 70 percent of users and skilled labor. So coming to Africa is, by all measurements, will benefit the business, the investment of America. So we are expecting more investors to come to Ethiopia and Africa; we are expecting more business from here to United States of America and from America to Ethiopia. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest airline who have the largest passengers from here, from Africa to United States of America and vice versa. This trade relationship will continue, and we hope that this visit also assists a lot to this \u2013 boosting this investment in trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Last question. Kylie Atwood, CBS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you. Secretary Tillerson, I want to pivot to North Korea for a minute with you. South Korea now says that Kim Jong-un is willing to negotiate with the U.S. on abandoning his nuclear program. You\u2019ve said that you are listening to North Korea, and you said that the message from them will come very explicitly. Is this the message that you needed to hear? And are you worried that the South Koreans are overeager? Can the U.S. now commit to negotiations with North Korea? And I have to ask you one more question about Russia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Only one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I got cut off last time. Can I ask one more? Thank you. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is said to be here in Ethiopia at the same time as you, and the Russian embassy says he\u2019s actually staying at this same hotel. He says there have been talks of you and he meeting. Do you plan to meet with him while you\u2019re here? And if not, what does that say about U.S. diplomacy, that you refuse an opportunity to meet face to face to express U.S. frustrations over Russia\u2019s continued military campaign in Syria? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>I think there\u2019s five or six questions in there. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m sorry, but we had to do it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY TILLERSON: </b>First, with respect to North Korea, I think, as President Trump has indicated, potentially positive signals coming from North Korea by way of their intra-Korean dialogue with South Korea. We maintain very, very close communication with President Moon of the Republic of Korea. They are keeping us well informed of their meetings, the content of those meetings and the nature of those meetings, and we\u2019re providing them input as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of direct talks with the United States \u2013 and you asked negotiations, and we\u2019re a long ways from negotiations. I think it\u2019s \u2013 we just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it. I think the first step \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this before \u2013 is to have talks, have some kind of talks about talks, because I don\u2019t know yet, until we are able to meet ourselves face to face with representatives of North Korea, whether the conditions are right to even begin thinking about negotiations. And that\u2019s kind of the current state of play.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to my meeting Foreign Minister Lavrov, I\u2019ve lost track of how many meetings he and I had last year. So any notion of us rejecting diplomatic engagement is really silly. That\u2019s just silly. We have had extensive negotiations, contact, dialogue. We have strategic dialogues. We have a number of mechanisms by which we talk to one another. I was unaware Foreign Minister Lavrov was going to be here at the same time I was until a couple of days ago, and I\u2019m unaware of any outreach to want to meet until I was on my way over here. My schedule\u2019s largely set, so if it doesn\u2019t work out here, he and I see each other often around the world, and we have each other\u2019s telephone numbers, and we do use them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you. I thank you, excellencies. Thank you, media houses. Your Excellency Tillerson said that this is his first visit, but I hope this will not be his last visit to Ethiopia. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

We will continue to implement measures to strengthen the economic empowerment of women and girls through policies and programs that promote entrepreneurship as well as broaden equal access to finance, decent work, training, and learning opportunities. We will build upon the success of women who have paved the way for more equality in the fields of defense, peacebuilding, and good governance, and work to solidify gains in these areas. We want to see more girls able to aspire to their full potential and to ensure they live in safe, healthy, and secure environments. Thus, we strive to create and invest in opportunities to enable girls to attain the education and freedoms they deserve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States is committed to working with governments and partners around the globe to ensure that countries everywhere enable women to thrive and realize their rights. In the 21st century, it is unconscionable that about one in three women has experienced some form of physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Far too many societies still deprive women of their human rights, discriminate based upon sex, pose obstacles to women\u2019s ability to contribute to economic development, or fail to uphold the laws intended to protect them. Such conditions deprive individuals, families, and communities of the contributions that empowered women can provide. As the U.S. National Security Strategy has asserted, governments that fail to treat women equally do not allow their societies to reach their full potential.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the spirit of International Women\u2019s Day, we recognize the leadership, contributions, and courage of women who have made sacrifices in the past, over many generations, to make the world a more safe, prosperous, and peaceful place.

Excellency Mr. Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State, United States of America, Excellency Ambassador Godec, colleagues from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, members of the Fourth Estate: I am delighted to welcome and host His Excellency Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State of the United States, to Nairobi today. The Secretary is in Kenya for three days as part of his official visit that began at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa and that is heading to a number of African countries, namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Chad, and Nigeria.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOn behalf of His Excellency the President, the government, and the people of Republic of Kenya, and indeed on my own behalf, I take this opportunity to express our utmost gratitude to Secretary Tillerson for his historic visit. Visiting Kenya as part of his first official tour of Africa is not only a great testament to, but a timely reaffirmation of, our deep historical and strategic relationship between Kenya and the United States of America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLate this afternoon, Secretary Tillerson had the opportunity to meet and hold bilateral talks with Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta, during which a range of issues were discussed and modalities of follow-up of agenda agreed upon. During their meeting, President Kenyatta expressed his satisfaction at the existing strong bilateral cooperation on a wide range of issues and areas. He reaffirmed his commitment to continue working closely with the administration of the United States on matters of mutual interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe discussion focused on priority areas of cooperation, including their shared conviction in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, other transnational crimes, as well as regional peace and security, and more importantly, our economic partnership.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the bilateral front, President Kenyatta shared his focus on the Big Four agenda, which aims at improving livelihoods, creating jobs, and growing the economy of Kenya by focusing on critical areas of our economy in the next five years. He urged the Government of the United States of America to support the implementation of the Big Four and observed with delight the steps taken by a number of American companies, including Bechtel International, to set their African headquarters in Nairobi and their readiness to commence investment in construction of a number of our infrastructure projects. The president also expressed his appreciation that all processes are now complete in readiness for the inaugural direct flight between Nairobi and New York and expressed his optimism in the \u2013 that this flight \u2013 this flight \u2013 direct flight between our countries will boost people-to-people contacts and trade between our countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our exchange of views with Secretary Tillerson, I have reaffirmed and the president as well has reaffirmed Kenya\u2019s commitment to the values of democratic governance, constitutionalism, the rule of law, and human rights. We underscored the importance of respecting established democratic institutions as the basis for entrenching democratic governance across the globe. We noted the exponential growth of trade between our countries and we hope that we can begin to negotiate towards concluding a framework that will succeed AGOA when it comes to an end in 2025.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt the regional front, Kenya sits in a fragile region with numerous security threats. We commend the Government of the United States of America for their existing robust partnership and support to us in the area of security, military, and intelligence cooperation. In this area, the president urged and Secretary Tillerson reaffirmed the commitment of the two countries to continue working together in the fight against terrorism, in countering violent extremism, and other security threats. We especially welcome the continued support of the USA to AMISOM. We in Kenya, like other troop-contributing countries, believe in the need for sustained engagement in order to sustain the gains made and to create an enabling environment to turn Somalia around. On South Sudan, we noted the slow progress in the IGAD high-level revitalization process, and we share very deep concerns about this crisis that has impact on large numbers of people. But President Kenyatta reaffirmed Kenya\u2019s continued demonstrated commitment towards our efforts to restore South Sudan to normalcy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn reference to environmental and wildlife conservation, we appreciate the longtime support from the U.S., especially against illegal poaching and trade of wildlife trophies obtained from endangered species, and we continue to urge further U.S. support in this endeavor in order that we can sustain and preserve our common humanity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI wish at this point to thank Secretary Tillerson for this historic visit. We hope he\u2019ll come back again to enjoy the fauna and beauty of our country that we hold in trust for humanity, and we hope that this time he will also take some time to enjoy a little bit of that menu. It is now my honor and pleasure to invite the Secretary of State of the United States to make his remark. Secretary Tillerson, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, thank you so much, Secretary Juma, for the welcome, and congratulations on your recent confirmation to your new position. And I truly enjoyed coming to Kenya and to continuing the work of the United States in this enduring partnership between our two countries. I do want to congratulate President Kenyatta and opposition leader Odinga on their meeting this morning and their joint announcement. This is a very positive step, in our view, and while we know addressing Kenya\u2019s ethnic and political divisions will take some time and effort, today both of these men showed great leadership in coming together in the agreement that they signed today. The United States looks forward to supporting the process that was announced this morning to bring the country together and to address the various national divisions. Kenya is a leader in Africa and a longtime partner of the United States, and we are steadfast in our support for Kenya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTomorrow, on behalf of the American people, I will pay my respects to those who died 20 years ago in the U.S. embassy attacks here and in Dar es Salaam. Tragically, we still are confronted with the face of terrorism. During our meeting today, we discussed threats facing Kenya, Africa, and the global community. The United States appreciates our security partnership with Kenya and our shared fight against terrorism. We recognize the 4,000 Kenyan troops serving in Somalia as part of AMISOM to counter al-Shabaab and bring stability to that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKenya is a country of tremendous opportunity. With a fast-growing GDP at more than 5 percent, a vibrant culture of entrepreneurship, and a regional economic \u2013 and a regional economic leader, we are eager to find more ways to work with you to grow our economic cooperation. In 2016, total trade between our countries was just under $1 billion. I know we can do much more, and we look forward to growing our trading relations. We commend the government\u2019s Big Four economic growth initiative, and look forward to deepening the ties between American and Kenyan business communities to support this effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the secretary already commented on, we shared our concerns during our discussions with the president about the importance of democratic institutions and Kenya as a leading democracy in Africa. We believe that there are actions that need to be taken in Kenya and that they need to correct certain actions, like shutting down TV stations and threatening the independence of the courts. I know Kenya takes these matters seriously. A free and independent media is essential to safeguarding democracy and giving all Kenyans confidence in their government.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States looks forward to growing our comprehensive relationship with Kenya. Our commitment is not to one party, but to all of the Kenyan people. We stand ready to assist Kenyan \u2013 Kenya and the Kenyan people as they move forward on what we know will be a very bright future. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Your Excellencies will take a few questions. I want to ask (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Karibu Kenya, Secretary Tillerson. Given the timing of the commitment to unity by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga \u2013 (inaudible) preceded your arrival \u2013 did the U.S. have anything to do with that mediation? And as mentioned by Secretary Monica Juma, the U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to Kenya\u2019s security \u2013 sorry, to collaborating with Kenya in the area of security, as well as growing trade. But what about the other programs, such as PEPFAR, Power Africa, YALI, and AGOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think the U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period. And we were very, very encouraged and pleased to see the two leaders come together today. But I think we really want to give them the credit. This was a very important, I think, action on their part to show that they\u2019re ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans regardless of party and begin to really take this long journey that\u2019s necessary to restore the country, eliminate these divisions that are creating obstacles to Kenya\u2019s future. And so I really \u2013 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning that came together in a very important agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We have another question from AP. (Inaudible.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Madame Cabinet Secretary \u2013 (inaudible) microphone? Madame Cabinet Secretary, could you respond to the Secretary\u2019s remarks, and can Kenya truly call itself a democracy in light of the severe restrictions imposed on free media in the country, starting with the silencing of television outlets, the firing of editors, and pressure on news outlets to stifle criticism of the government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Mr. Secretary, can you talk a little bit about the fact that your administration has been running the government for more than a year now and we still see vacancies in key administration posts, including assistant and under secretaries, also including the North Korean envoy? What\u2019s taking so long to fill these posts and what\u2019s your response to allegations that some posts are being left unfilled intentionally? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JUMA</strong>: Let me respond to the question around the media, because I think this has been played up significantly. First of all, I think the definition of democracy goes way beyond the media, but also the provision of free press in this country is secured within our constitution. And the incident that is being referenced here is a one-off incident. It\u2019s an incident that affected three of more than tens of TV stations in this country. It is a matter that involved investigation of the police, and you will know, if you operate in this environment, that we have perhaps the largest media corps anywhere on this African continent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the notion that there is a restriction of the media in Kenya is actually not backed by fact and reality. In this country, I think it is important for me to emphasize that we bestowed upon ourselves a progressive constitution because we believed that only that constitution, only those liberties, only those privileges guaranteed by the constitution would help us to realize our full potential as a country. And that involves a whole range of rights and protection of institutions beyond the media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have to say this, that since this process began, the start of that new constitution, which was three decades ago, up and until 2010, when we promulgated the 2010 constitution, and from 2010 to today, including in the event that Secretary of State was referencing this morning, are all indications of our fidelity to our aspiration to deepen our democratic credentials. And therefore, I want to put it to everyone here that the democratic project in this country is on the right trajectory, and it is not under any form of threat whatsoever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON:</strong> Well, I think this is a question you\u2019re probably going to be asking the day the end of the first term of this administration ends. We have a number of nominees in the system, as you well know. We have \u2013 we\u2019ve had a number that have been confirmed this year. There are several waiting on their hearings to be scheduled before the relevant committees. But as you well know, the process is a fairly rigorous one, from the time we select an individual, they agree to serve, to go through their clearance processes, to go through the clearance both from a standpoint of security but also the clearance with the White House process, and then make their way over to be nominated directly for consideration by the confirmation by the Senate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd along that way, not surprisingly, sometimes things come up and people decide they want to proceed any further, or things come up that disqualify individuals. That\u2019s why we have a clearance process. It\u2019s an important element of the whole process of naming and confirming people so that when they are confirmed and they\u2019re ready to serve, there\u2019s no question that they meet all the qualifications as well. And when that happens, we have to start the process over, and that\u2019s happened to us on a number of occasions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think with respect to the open positions \u2013 I\u2019ve said this many, many times; I\u2019m going to stick with what I\u2019ve said and stand by it \u2013 I think if you look at the results that we\u2019re getting in very important policy areas, and you mentioned North Korea, and the open positions we have there, I think as we\u2019ve seen in the last 24 hours, the policy that was put in place and has been executed by the State Department over the past year has succeeded. And we\u2019ve done that in spite of the fact that we have people serving in acting positions in some cases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo as I\u2019ve said many times, I don\u2019t lose a wink of sleep over the fact that we may not have our nominees in the position because we have very capable, skilled, career diplomats ready to step up and serve in those positions. And they are serving superbly, and we are moving the policies forward, and nothing is being held up because the positions are open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWould I like to have them filled? Of course I would like to have them filled, because it\u2019s easier on everyone, including our career people, and some of the career people that are waiting for confirmation. It\u2019s a very different matter to be Senate-confirmed versus in an acting role, and we know that. But having said that, I am very, very proud of the State Department and the work that we\u2019re getting done.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>One final question from Ferdinand Omondi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. It\u2019s Ferdinand from the BBC. The United Nations accuses Kenya and Uganda of aiding the conflict in South Sudan by supplying arms at a time when the U.S. is pushing South Sudan\u2019s neighbors to enforce an arms embargo. What is the U.S. position in this, and what actions, if any, are being taken?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY TILLERSON</strong>: Well, the U.S. believes that the arms embargo should be enforced, and that\u2019s \u2013 our position has been very clear on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JUMA:</strong> I also have to state here that Kenya is not involved in any supply of arms to any of the parties. For the longest period of time, Kenya has been involved in the search for peace in South Sudan, and it would be foolhardy that we would invest in the search for peace while at the same time arming parties to that conflict. We take the first unintended consequences, including large numbers of refugees that are already flowing into our territories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I have to make it abundantly clear that Kenya has no intention of exacerbating that conflict, that Kenya is engaged in terms of efforts to normalize South Sudan, and it is not in our policy or our intention to get involved in supplying arms to either South Sudan or any other country for that matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MODERATOR: </strong>Thank you, Your Excellencies. And that concludes \u2013 that\u2019s the end of this press briefing. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us, and apologies for the slight delay in getting started. Brian Hook is joining us. As you all know, Brian was just in Europe with a delegation from the State Department and also the NSC, where Brian was meeting\u2014 and our colleagues\u2014 meeting with members of the E3 in Berlin, and then he went to Vienna \u2013 they all went to Vienna \u2013 for the quarterly meeting with the JCPOA. Brian met with press last week and overseas, and would like to provide you all not only with an update but a \u2013 just sort of an analysis and readout of where we are in the overall discussions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Brian will make some comments and then we\u2019ll have time to take several of your questions. We ask that you wait until the end of the call to start writing about this and tweeting, as we normally do, and embargoed. That\u2019s a simple way of putting it: embargoed until the conclusion of the call.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Director of Policy Planning Brian Hook for his comments and your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thank you, Heather, and thank you for organizing this call, and thanks to everybody who\u2019s joined the call. As Heather mentioned, there was an American delegation that first went to Berlin and then we went to Vienna for the Joint Commission meeting, and let me say just a little bit about both meetings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Berlin, this is the third meeting with our European allies since the President delivered his statement on January 12th. As you know, on January 12th, the President set forth the conditions that would need to be met in order for the \u2013 for him to continue waving sanctions as part of America\u2019s commitments in the JCPOA. And what the President asked for on January 12th was a new supplemental agreement with European allies that (inaudible) impose new multilateral sanctions if Iran develops or tests long-range missiles, thwarts inspections, or makes progress toward a nuclear weapon. And he has given his negotiating team until May 12th to reach a supplemental agreement to fix the deficiencies of the Iran nuclear deal. And so we have been operating under that guidance since then. We have had three meetings with our European allies \u2013 one in London, one in Paris, and then the last one was in Berlin \u2013 and at these meetings we are negotiating a new supplemental agreement and we are also \u2013 and the focus there is around the sunsets, the sunsetting of restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the omission of ICBMs from the original Iran nuclear agreement, and a stronger inspections regime so that we can support the work of the IAEA so they can verify that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 in all of these meetings, half of our day is spent negotiating a supplemental agreement. The other half of the day we spend on making progress on the six areas that the President identified on January 12th. He called on our allies to take stronger steps with the United States to confront Iran\u2019s other malign activities, and that includes cutting off funding to the IRGC and constraining Iran\u2019s missile development program, countering Iran\u2019s cyber aggression, its maritime aggression, asking other countries to pressure Iran for all of its human rights violations. So we spend half of these meetings working on steps that we need to take collectively against Iran\u2019s other activities, and this is consistent with the policy shift that this administration effected, which is addressing the totality of Iranian threats and not having (inaudible) on the nuclear deal at the exclusion of all of the other threats that Iran presents. And I would refer you to the President\u2019s statement on January 12th for more detail on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe then went to Vienna for a meeting of the Joint Commission. I think as many of you know, the Joint Commission is part of the JCPOA and it oversees the implementation of the Plan of Action that was reached in 2015 with the previous administration, and it meets on a regular basis to review Iran\u2019s compliance with the JCPOA and to address concerns raised by member states. They were productive meetings and we fulfilled what we set out to do. We are meeting our commitments under the JCPOA, and we will \u2013 we continue to hold Iran strictly accountable for its commitments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that we did in that meeting was to take stock of one of the key provisions of the JCPOA, which is that the Iran deal will, quote, \u201cpositively contribute to regional and international peace and security.\u201d That is mentioned in the deal, and since it took over two years to negotiate and every word was weighed carefully, we take all of these provisions seriously. And when you look at Iran\u2019s foreign and domestic policies, it\u2019s impossible to argue that they have \u2013 that they are behaving constructively or with greater moderation in the last two years. In fact, quite the reverse. They are aggressively destabilizing the Middle East and present a range of threats to peace and security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this was an opportunity for us in Vienna to listen to any concerns that the Iranians had about us meeting our end of the deal. The Iranians complained that this administration is warning other nations about the dangers of doing business in Iran and that this is hurting their economy. And what I said in response was that Iran\u2019s opaque economy makes it hard for investors to know whether they are supporting commerce or supporting terrorism, and I said that Iran needs to stop sponsoring terrorism, stop destabilizing the Middle East, and overhaul its banking and business sectors. It\u2019s not America\u2019s job to make up for the shortcomings of Iranian policies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also requested a meeting with the Iranian delegation to demand the release of the American citizens that they have arbitrarily and unjustly detained.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the summary of the meetings in Berlin and Vienna. I\u2019m happy to take questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll go ahead and take your questions. And Nicole has a list of who\u2019s on the call, so I\u2019ll just defer to my colleague, Nicole, who will handle that. Nicole, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press * then 1.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur first question comes from the line of Josh Lederman, AP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I was wondering if you have spoken to Director Pompeo in the last week about this deal. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that Secretary Tillerson was more enthusiastic about trying to salvage this deal than perhaps Pompeo will be. So can you tell us how that transition may affect the work that you\u2019re doing on this. And then if you can give us any details about your separate meeting with the Iranians; did you make any progress on those detained Americans? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks, Josh. On the first question, I don\u2019t want to comment on internal discussions. What I can say is that a number of us are providing assistance to Secretary-designate Pompeo\u2019s confirmation process, and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the Senate confirmation process, but if he is confirmed, and we certainly hope he will be, he will then be, I think, well equipped to do all of the work that we\u2019re currently working on, the range of activities that he\u2019s been working on as CIA Director. And so I think he\u2019s got such a deep familiarity with so many of these issues from his current position that it will be a very easy transition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn your other question, can you remind me, Josh? I couldn\u2019t \u2013 what was the second part of the question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, the other question was about your bilat with the Iranians. Did you make any progress?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Oh yeah, the bilat with the \u2013 yeah, the bilat with the Iranians, as I said, the only purpose in requesting it was to demand the release of the Americans that they\u2019ve detained. Given the sensitivity of that subject, I don\u2019t want to go beyond what I said, that I requested the meeting and I did have a discussion with them, and that\u2019s as much as I can say on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And can you tell us whether you expect to stay at S/P?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK: </strong>Everyone in the Executive Branch serves at the pleasure of the President, and I am continuing to advance the administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And that question comes from the line of Karen DeYoung, <em>Washington Post.</em> Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Karen, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello? Oh, hi. Thank you. You said that the United States is complying with all of its commitments under the JCPOA, although you mentioned the part that says that they need to pay attention to certain other things. Would you say that they are or are not complying with their commitments under the JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> I would say that they are in \u2013 that they are in technical \u2013 we have not heard \u2013 we go over sanctions and we go over nuclear \u2013 we talked about the nuclear issues, civil nuclear on the agenda for the Joint Commission, and they are in technical \u2013 my understanding is that they are in technical compliance with their commitments under the JCPOA. The Iranians had a number of complaints about licenses, especially around civil aviation licenses to Iran Air and other airlines. And what I said to them was: You use your commercial airlines to move terrorists and weapons around the Middle East, including to Syria, and we will not issue licenses at the expense of our national security. And so I encouraged them to make the kind of reforms to their civil aviation and to their economy that would then put us in a better position. But we are not going to be issuing licenses at the expense of our national security or at the expense of our allies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> That comes from the line of Elise Labott, CNN. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the idea that you just said, that you see that the Iranians are in technical compliance \u2013 and obviously, the Europeans have said the same thing and they don\u2019t want to do a kind of additional supplement to the agreement, but have clearly said to you that they\u2019re willing to work with you on some of these other issues such as the sunset, the ICBM, inspections outside of the contours of a deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering, like, what \u2013 I think this is the basic question that everyone is asking, like what is the point of even withdrawing from the deal if you can deal with these concerns with the Europeans outside of the confines of it? Whereas if you push and you pull out of the deal that they\u2019re not going to work with you on it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd then a second part of that is if Iran is in technical compliance of the deal and you\u2019re working towards possible discussions with North Korea on a nuclear deal, what kind of confidence does it give the North Koreans if you\u2019re willing to kind of change the goalposts and say technical compliance is one thing but the spirit of the agreement is another? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks, Elise. I think on the second part, in the context of nonproliferation agreements or treaties, it is very common to add supplemental agreements. START \u2013 New START does not violate START. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a very common practice in arms control to be making adjustments to a nonproliferation agreement as you go along.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat\u2019s unique about the JCPOA is that it\u2019s not an arms control treaty. It\u2019s not even an agreement. It\u2019s a plan of action that was agreed to by the prior administration and it doesn\u2019t have the same standing as a treaty would. And so this is a \u2013 I think a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s <em>sui generis</em> nonproliferation plan of action that\u2019s a political document. And this is an agreement that has many deficiencies. We think that these deficiencies are of such threats to national security that we can\u2019t allow the deal to remain in place without a supplemental agreement to address its deficiencies. And so that\u2019s our focus there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of North Korea, when you look at the history of negotiations with North Korea, no one has moved the goalposts or negotiated in more bad faith than North Korea. They have a history of noncompliance, but with the United States, we then stick to the terms of the deal, and we have not had a partner \u2013 we have not had somebody on the other the side of the table in (inaudible) with the Kim family over three generations now who negotiate in good faith. And so we are determined not to make some of the past mistakes again in the context of North Korea, and the maximum pressure campaign continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Our next question comes from the line of Michele Kelemen, NPR. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, hi. One quick question about the negotiations with the Europeans: Do you think that whatever supplemental deal is really going to be enough to keep the President inside the JCPOA? And then on this question of the Americans, are you proposing kind of a separate humanitarian channel, is this going to be something more regular, or was this a one-off meeting?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> What we have is the President\u2019s guidance on January 12th where he has explained the conditions that would have to be met to continue waiving sanctions, and those are the instructions we\u2019re operating under. He will have to reach an \u2013 he will have to reach a decision as to \u2013 are we able to \u2013 first we have to reach an agreement with the Europeans, and if we can\u2019t reach an agreement with the Europeans, then we will report that to the President. If we can reach an agreement, then that will be presented to the President by the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor, and then he will make a decision on whether he wants to remain in the deal or stop waiving sanctions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> That comes from the line of Arshad Mohammed of Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for doing this. Has \u2013 have you made any progress in the talks so far with the three European partners on the specific question of the sunsets under the JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: I appreciate you asking the question, but I don\u2019t want to get into the substance of our negotiations. We \u2013 where we have agreement, we are capturing the agreement, and where we have differences, we are working to narrow them to see if we can reach an agreement. And so that\u2019s been the nature of the process. As I\u2019ve said before, we have had very constructive meetings and we are (inaudible) toward reaching an agreement, and we\u2019ll see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Okay. Our next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR</strong>: The next question is from Felicia Schwartz, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Hey, Brian, thanks for doing this. First, should we take your comments earlier on the airline licenses to mean that the Boeing deal is on hold, or perhaps in danger? And then are you discussing contingencies with the Europeans in these meetings at this point if the President does pull out of the deal, since May is not too far away? And what is the status of the legislative fix?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: On the first part about the civil aviation, most of that was related to \u2013 I think that\u2019s related mostly to parts. What I said earlier is not meant to make any commentary or opinion on the other part that you raised. I was just saying that with respect to civil aviation, we are meeting our obligations under the deal in terms of aviation licenses. They have acknowledged that we have not issued any new civil aviation licenses in this administration. The previously issued licenses remain in place, but we never intended to let licensed aircraft contribute to Iran\u2019s regional destabilization effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Felicia, what was the second?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Just \u2013 are you discussing contingencies at this point if the President does decide to pull out, since May is only a few months away? And also, the legislative fix, where does that stand?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: I will defer to Congress on the legislative fix. The President set forth a plan. What the President wants to do is to give Congress a role to address the range of threats that Iran presents. The prior administration did not submit this nonproliferation plan of action to the Senate and bypass the Congress. In this administration, the President is working with the Congress to \u2013 we think one aspect of fixing the Iran deal is giving the role to Congress. The other aspect of it is securing an agreement with our European allies to address its deficiencies. And so those are the \u2013 sort of the two key lines of effort. So that\u2019s really where our focus is.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Okay. We have time for just a couple extra questions. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR</strong>: The next question is from the line of Dave Clark, AFP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Hello, can you hear me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yep.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: Yep, sure can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: Yeah. Hi, Dave Clark here from AFP. I know that our Israeli colleague Barak Ravid is reporting that Israeli officials are saying that President Trump told them that a supplemental agreement would be insufficient, and that he wants the deal itself to be torn up otherwise. He\u2019s thinking of \u2013 he\u2019s thinking of pulling out. I wouldn\u2019t ask you to comment on leaks from another government, but are you clear yourself and are you able to articulate to our European allies what exactly the President\u2019s redlines are? And do you \u2013 are you clear yourself as to what it would take to convince him to stay in the deal? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR</strong> <strong>HOOK</strong>: Well, I also \u2013 before I answer that, let me just go back to what Felicia asked about contingency planning. The President has, as I said earlier, given us negotiating guidance in his January 12th statement. And so he has asked if we can reach agreement with the Europeans. We always have to prepare for any eventuality, and so we are engaged in contingency planning because it would not be responsible not to engage in it. We are \u2013 we\u2019re kind of dual-tracking this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so on the other question about the meeting with the President, I wouldn\u2019t comment on any sort of discussion that the President had privately with another country. So I don\u2019t really have anything to add there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: And I would --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: No, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS</strong> <strong>NAUERT</strong>: I would just confirm \u2013 excuse me, I would just highlight, Dave, that we haven\u2019t seen that report ourselves from Israel, and so just can\u2019t confirm that that is what anybody from the administration said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION</strong>: No, but I didn\u2019t ask you to comment on that report, but I just wanted to know if Mr. Hook is himself clear on exactly what the agreement with the Europeans would have to involve for the President to sign off on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK</strong>: The President has identified sunsets, inspections and ICBMs. And so those are the three areas of focus for us, and we have a delegation, a team that is working on this with representatives from the State Department and the White House. We have a very good interagency team that\u2019s working on this to be faithful to the President\u2019s instructions on negotiations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. And we\u2019re going to have to do the last question. Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. I know you had a question, if we can pull you in there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And Nick Wadhams, Bloomberg News, please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks. Can you hear me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Yeah, we can hear you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Okay. Can I just ask Brian two quick things? One, how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to reach a deal with the Europeans? Are you hopeful that there is \u2013 that you can cross the finish line on this, or are you skeptical that you\u2019ll be able to reach something?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd also you mentioned that you would need to come to some agreement with the Europeans to present to the President in May. What about Russia, China, and Iran? What if you don\u2019t secure agreement from them before May? Or is the strategy that you would get the European agreement and then take that to the President, and then work on those other parties to the plan of action? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> We have had constructive talks with the Europeans toward a supplemental agreement, but I can\u2019t predict whether we will reach an agreement with them or not. We have a goal in mind, and we either will reach agreement or we won\u2019t.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the second part of the question, the only guidance that we \u2013 that the President gave is to reach an agreement with the E3. And that is the first phase of this, which is through May 12th. And I won\u2019t speculate beyond May 12th, because that is \u2013 that\u2019s as much as our negotiating instructions allow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Thanks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and Brian, thank you for your time. We\u2019ll let you get back to shoveling snow or whatever one does in the suburbs. (Laughter.) The embargo on the call has now been lifted. If anyone has any follow-up questions, PA is staffed, we\u2019re all working, so let us know if you need anything. Brian, thank you, and thank you everybody for your time today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Okay, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay, bye.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR HOOK:</strong> Thanks so much, everybody. Bye.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "date": "March 23, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\tAt the 37<sup>th</sup> Human Rights Council session in Geneva, February 26-March 23, the U.S. addressed urgent human rights situations around the world. This session brought attention to human rights issues in Iran, Syria, North Korea, Burma, Cambodia and South Sudan, among others. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee delivered our national statement on February 28, underscoring the U.S. commitment to human rights, as well as our continued concerns about the Council\u2019s disproportionate focus on Israel and our commitment to reforming the Council. The United States introduced a resolution on South Sudan that the Council adopted with broad cross-regional support. Our active engagement on all other Council actions allowed the U.S. to protect critical legal and policy equities and achieve successful outcomes. In addition, through national and joint statements, the United States addressed human rights situations in China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, the DRC, Egypt, Turkey, Burundi, Azerbaijan, the Maldives, Vietnam, and Bahrain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Supporting Israel:</b> The United States worked closely with Israel and other partners to combat the institutionalized bias against Israel both by opposing Agenda Item 7, the only Council agenda item focused on a single country, and by voting against every resolution introduced under Item 7. Australia joined in voting against all Item 7 resolutions, while many other partners changed votes to either vote no or abstain. This session demonstrated the largest shift in votes towards more abstentions and no votes on Israel related resolutions since the creation of the HRC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Standing up for the Integrity of UN Human Rights Mechanisms:</b> The United States voted against a China-led resolution on <b>mutually beneficial cooperation</b>, which sought to weaken international human rights frameworks by demanding that governments be \u201crespected\u201d (i.e. not have their human rights records criticized) and suggesting that governments could agree on \u201cwin-win\u201d exceptions to human rights concerns. In a strong explanation of vote, the United States underscored that \u201cfeel good\u201d language about mutually beneficial cooperation is intended to benefit autocratic states at the expense of individuals whose human rights and fundamental freedoms we should all respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Iran</b>: The United States played a key role in garnering support for the resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The United States also read, on behalf of a group of 27 countries, a joint statement addressing the recent crackdown in Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>North Korea:</b> The United States supported a resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, condemned the ongoing systematic and widespread human rights violations and abuses, called for accountability, and voiced ongoing support for monitoring and documentation efforts by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Syria: </b>The United States supported an urgent debate on the dire situation in eastern Ghouta, which culminated in a resolution condemning the violations of the ceasefire. The United States also co-sponsored the resolution renewing the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which condemned the violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law throughout Syria, primarily by the Assad regime, including the use of chemical weapons, abuse of detainees, and denial of humanitarian aid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>South Sudan:</b> The United States led a resolution to renew the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for another year to collect and preserve evidence that can be used in future judicial efforts, including the AU Hybrid Court for South Sudan. We worked closely with South Sudan, members of the African Group, and other member states to ensure the text was adopted by consensus. South Sudan\u2019s support for the resolution reaffirmed its commitment to continue cooperating with the Commission and UN bodies and mechanisms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Burma: </b>The United States co-sponsored an EU-led resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and support the work of other special procedures, including the Fact Finding Mission, which are invaluable in investigating and highlighting the human rights situation in Burma. The resolution was adopted following a vote called by China.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Cambodia</b>: The United States joined 44 other countries in supporting New Zealand\u2019s joint statement highlighting the decline in civil and political rights in Cambodia in the run up to national elections scheduled for July 29. The joint statement noted that an electoral process from which the main democratic opposition party is arbitrarily excluded cannot be considered genuine or legitimate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Other Country Situations:</b> The United States co-sponsored priority resolutions that renewed mandates on <b>Burma</b> and <b>North Korea</b>, as well as a resolution drawing attention to the human rights situations in <b>Georgia</b>, including the Russian-occupied territories of Georgia. We supported cooperative resolutions on <b>Libya</b> and <b>Mali.</b> The United States also delivered a statement supporting the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 engagement in <b>Yemen</b>, <b>Georgia</b>, <b>Afghanistan</b>, and <b>Haiti</b>. Additionally, the United States joined joint statements highlighting serious concerns regarding the human rights situations in <b>Cambodia</b>, <b>Maldives</b>, and <b>Sri Lanka</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Development Resolutions: </b>The United States worked actively to remove trade-related language from resolutions on development, and to ensure that all resolutions that touch on development make clear that states may not use their lack of development or related concerns to excuse a failure to uphold their human rights obligations or commitments. We re-stated our long-standing opposition to recognizing a \u201cright to development.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Thematic Issues:</b> The United States co-sponsored resolutions on <b>freedom of religion or belief</b>, <b>good governance</b>, the prevention of <b>genocide</b>, the rights of <b>minorities</b> and of persons with <b>disabilities</b>, and the impact of corruption on <b>torture</b>, among others. The United States also opposed a cynical Russia-led resolution on \u201cintegrity of the judicial system,\u201d which failed to address issues of judicial independence, and inaccurately reflected aspects of international law.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients. You can applause. (Laughter.) (Applause.) We would like to welcome them into the room. (Applause.) And they have come a long, long way to get here to meet you in Washington. (Applause.)</span></span>\n\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to welcome First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump. Melania, Mrs. Trump, welcome. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Thank you, everyone, and welcome to the State Department. I am honored to welcome you to the 12th Annual Secretary of State\u2019s International Women of Courage Awards, which have recognized more than 120 remarkable women from dozens of countries since the award\u2019s inception. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In addition to the privilege of being joined by the First Lady, I would also like to extend a special welcome to the members of the diplomatic corps in the audience, including Ambassador Callista Gingrich. Where is she? She\u2019s here somewhere. Thank you, there she is. Ambassador Gingrich, welcome. (Applause.) She joins us from the Vatican today and has been in Washington this week. It\u2019s wonderful to have you back here with us.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We know that women\u2019s voices are critical to global security, prosperity, and peace, which is why the Department of State annually presents the International Women of Courage Awards. Each awardee\u2019s story is an inspiring reminder of how individuals can make a difference. Taken together, they provide a powerful message of courage and leadership. And you can read some of their profiles in your pamphlets that you have with you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This year we have recognized 10 extraordinary women who have demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight day in and day out for what they believe. The formidable leaders include a former slave and anti-slavery activist, a human rights lawyer documenting abuse under the junta rule, a nun sheltering internally displaced people from violence, a writer, director, and producer who wrote scripts under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and a courageous advocate for the families of forcibly disappeared persons. We are so happy to have them here today.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States is proud to honors these leaders as part of our commitment to advancing the status of women and girls around the world. I want to take a moment to thank my colleagues in the Secretary\u2019s Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues for the work that they do to ensure that women\u2019s equality and empowerment are integrated into our U.S. foreign policy. Our GWI folks, thank you so much for bringing them all together. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>I\u2019d also like to recognize the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, whose people-to-people programs are a critical element of our diplomacy, including the International Visitor Leadership Program these women are about to embark on for the next two weeks, I believe, as they share their stories with audiences around the United States.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This commitment to women\u2019s empowerment is the reason that President Trump signed the Women, Peace, and Security Act into law last October. The new law affirms the United States commitment to expanding women\u2019s leadership on the issues of international peace and security, especially efforts to prevent conflict and atrocities, promote peace and counterterrorism, and also violent extremism. We know that when women are empowered, communities are safer and countries are more stable. We see that around the world every day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Another way to ensure that women are empowered is by expanding economic access and opportunity. Reports show that if the world closed the gender gap in workforce participation, global GDP would increase by $28 trillion by the year 2025. That is precisely why President Trump galvanized the creation of the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Finance Initiative through a U.S. contribution of $50 million at the G20 Leaders Summit last summer. Along with contributions from international partners, the initiative has leveraged more than 340 million in support to help advance women\u2019s entrepreneurship around the globe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>From day one, the Trump administration has been committed to empowering women. Women\u2019s empowerment is not only a basic fulfilment of human rights, but a strategic investment in our collective future. Women and girls must have the tools they need to succeed and the pathways that they seek opened. That includes a safe environment that promotes their health and also their education. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Whether at home or abroad, expanding opportunities for women and girls is a priority of this President for this administration. And today I\u2019m honored to introduce someone who plays a central role in this critical initiative. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>As a philanthropist and a humanitarian, the First Lady has been a driving force behind the administration\u2019s efforts to promote the empowerment of women and children in our society. Mrs. Trump has been an Honorary Chairwoman for the Boys\u2019 Club of New York for five consecutive years and in 2005 was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador for the American Red Cross. She helped launch the National Child Abuse Prevention Month in April of 2008 and has been a champion for the American Heart Association. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Her deep concern for issues affecting children continues. As First Lady she is focused on the challenges of what children are exposed to online through technology. And as a mom whose children are always trying to sneak her electronic devices, I thank you for your work on that. (Laughter.) A lot of us can relate to that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump works tirelessly to raise awareness of the damaging effects of opioids and the harmful effects that drugs can have on pregnant women, particularly on newborns who develop neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS. Mrs. Trump, the State Department has watched with a great deal of pride as you visited hospitals and women\u2019s groups around the country to draw attention to this. Thank you for that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump is a powerful voice promoting women\u2019s equality and improving the lives of women and girls around the world. Now please join me in welcoming the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Melania Trump. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The First Lady gives remarks.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Mrs. Trump. Thanks to all of you. As Mrs. Trump just discussed, courage takes many, many forms. This year, we are honored to recognize 10 extraordinary women who have dedicated and demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight for what they believe in day in and day out. I\u2019d like to introduce you to these women.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>First, we have Roya Sadat. She\u2019s from Afghanistan. She is a writer, a producer, a film director. Ms. Sadat, she\u2019s over here. She is being honored for refusing to be silenced in her home country. She uses the arts to raise awareness of the brutal challenges facing women and girls, and despite threats to herself, her cast, and her crew, she\u2019s served as a pioneer for Afghanistan\u2019s cultural reawakening. In fact, she wrote her film, \u201cThree Dots,\u201d while keeping it a secret from the Taliban, and many of you will recall that entertainment was not allowed \u2013 music, films, all of that was not allowed under the Taliban. Congratulations to you. Thank you for your bravery. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next, from Honduras, we have Dr. Julissa Villanueva.

Welcome and thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aliyah Khalaf Saleh. She\u2019s from Iraq. A humanitarian volunteer working to resist sectarian and radical ideology, Ms. Saleh is being honored for her bravery, her heroism, and her compassion in the wake of ISIS terror. She selflessly risked her own life to save others. In fact, she is credited with rescuing 58 young Iraqi military cadets who were ambushed by ISIS back in 2014. Imagine the bravery that takes for a woman in that country. It\u2019s really incredible. She risked her own life to save others, and working with all Iraqi communities as well as security forces. Congratulations. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Such tremendous bravery in this room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Sister Maria Elena Berini.

Sister Maria Elena is being honored for her service to counter hatred, injustice, and war-related horrors. She has provided refuge to those internally displaced people by conflict; and her tireless work to bring peace in the Central African Republic. Thank you, Sister. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aiman Umarova. She\u2019s from Kazakhstan. She is a lawyer, a human rights defender, a promoter of justice and other reforms. Ms. Umarova is being honored for improving laws to address violence against women and children, delivering justice in a number of landmark cases for rape victims, and her efforts in countering violent extremism despite the grave risks that she faces in Kazakhstan. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Dr. Feride Rushiti is from Kosovo. She\u2019s the founder and executive director of the Kosovo Center for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims. Dr. Rushiti is being honored for decades of advocacy on behalf of civilian victims of Kosovo\u2019s war, including rape survivors, and she\u2019s laid the groundwork for a legislative victory to support survivors of wartime sexual violence. Thank you, Doctor. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To Mauritania now. I would like to introduce you to L\u2019Malouma Said from Mauritania. She\u2019s a former slave and now a deputy member of parliament in Mauritania\u2019s National Assembly. That is incredible. (Applause.) Mrs. Said is being honored \u2013 wait here, Mrs. Said. (Laughter.) You can stay here. We\u2019re not done yet. Stay right there. Thank you. Mrs. Said is being honored for her relentless activism in the fight against slavery, including work in the country\u2019s most effective anti-slavery organization; perseverance and promotion of human rights and equality; and resolve in addressing a failing prison system in Mauritania. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Godelive Mukasarasi is from Rwanda. She\u2019s the founder and coordinator of an NGO dedicated to helping widows and orphans of the Rwandan genocide, and she is herself a survivor of that trauma. She is being honored for her instrumental role in bringing women\u2019s voices to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, leading to the first historic conviction of rape as a war crime. Thank you, ma\u2019am, for your courage. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next, Sirikan Charoensiri is from Thailand. She is a lawyer and human rights defender and is being honored for fiercely standing up for human rights. She includes \u2013 this includes the rights to peaceful assembly and expression. During Thailand\u2019s military rule, she co-founded an organization to provide pro bono legal services to those who are facing politically motivated charges and overcoming unprecedented harassment and persecution. As a result of her advocacy, she now faces three sets of criminal charges for her work as a lawyer, and those charges include sedition. What a brave woman. Thank you.

She has been an activist since her brother disappeared back in 1984. Since then, she\u2019s received death threats, and has even been kidnapped by armed assailants in her country. We recognize Ms. Farfan in absentia today, as she is not able to travel to Washington from Guatemala due to a current medical condition that she suffers.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So please join me in thanking these women, welcoming these women to the United States, and I would like to introduce you to our next speaker. Please join me in giving a round of applause for this remarkable group of leaders, and it is my pleasure to introduce one of our women of courage, who will give remarks on behalf of the group, Godelive Mukasarasi from Rwanda. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS MUKASARASI:</b> Mrs. Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to stand here to tell you my joy and my gratitude for this acknowledgement of my work in Rwanda. As a committed activist, I have been fighting for the rights of women, victims of rape, and their children born of such rapes during the genocide against the Tutsis in 1993 and \u201994. Through an extensive therapy process to help heal them of their trauma and through active advocacy, the rape victims have become models of self-development and resilient citizens.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>During the genocide, one million innocent lives were lost and millions of survivors were affected by the trauma, left with physical and emotional wounds. Rape has been used as a war weapon. Tutsi women and girls raped, raped en masse, and some of them became pregnant or by the militia and soldiers of the former regime. A number of these women were infected with HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Some underwent genital mutilation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Others were forced to marry the perpetrators as a price to escape death, therefore becoming sexual servants and captives. When the militias were defeated, the women returned to their families but were rejected and stigmatized by relatives for having been the spouse of a militia member or for being pregnant by them. They were told to abort or to walk away with their cursed pregnancy. Some of these women decided to abort or they have left their families to hide far away, protecting those babies who today are beautiful 24 year-old women and the men.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Even too, the Government of Rwanda has done everything to address the effect of the genocide, the cases of rape were kept silent, because speaking of sexual issues is taboo in Rwanda culture. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Breaking the silence of this crime, I started the SEVOTA organization in Taba in December 1994. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Before meeting SEVOTA organization, every woman thought she was alone and would remain humiliated. But when sharing their stories, they find out that they could decided to accept themselves and accept their children. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>After experiencing the SEVOTA healing session and receiving assistance, these Rwandan women decide to speak out against the rape and stood up to testify about them in the international criminal court of Rwanda. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These women \u2013 these women\u2019s advocacy persuaded the international community make rape punishable as a crime against humanity. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These resilient women and young people are fully integrated in the community, undertaking income-producing activities, sustaining themselves, and preventing renewed trauma. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>However, there is the need for more attention, as many of them are living with post-traumatic effects such as HIV/AIDS, poverty, and a fragilized and wounded memory.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This is why SEVOTA continues to advocate, to heal, and to participate in self-development program using different channel \u2013 different channel, such as the recent film \u201cThe Uncondemned,\u201d where Seraphine, Victoria, and Cecile played a key role in speaking out. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my profound gratitude toward those who have encouraged me, including the Government of Rwanda, which appoint me as one of the guardians of the social pacts, and the institution who have selected me for this prize. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Finally, I would like to extend many thank you who have attended this ceremony, and most of all, my sincerest thanks to First Lady Mrs. Melania Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, the Secretary Office for Global Women\u2019s Issues, and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you. Godelive, thank you so much. Please join me in a final round of applause for this remarkable group of women leaders. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States will continue to work the advance \u2013 the rights of women and girls globally, well aware that when women do better, countries do better, families do better, we all do better. Mrs. Trump, thank you for your inspiring words and for being part of today\u2019s ceremony and our ceremony last year as well. This is certainly your passion, and we are so grateful to have you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees, thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do. Thank you for your bravery, for your commitment, especially in the face of adversity. We honor you and your work.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At this time, I\u2019d like to ask the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients to please stand for a group photo together, and we\u2019ll get a picture together, and then we\u2019ll conclude our ceremonies.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Awardees then depart. Let\u2019s take a picture first.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The picture is taken.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees depart. Thank you, ladies. (Applause.) And thanks to all of you for coming today. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>For those of us who are joining us in our reception, you are now invited to proceed to the Ben Franklin room, and that is on the eighth floor. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, our First Lady, and thank you to these wonderful ladies. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Flintlock exercises have taken place regularly since 2005 with partner nations from the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) and are planned by African partner nation special operations forces; Special Operations Command, Africa (SOCAFRICA); and the U.S. Department of State. Approximately 1,900 service members from 20 African and Western partner nations will participate in Flintlock at multiple locations in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Senegal from April 9-20, 2018.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe largest civilian component to Flintlock 2018 is the law enforcement training and equipment provided under the Department of State\u2019s Antiterrorism Assistance (ATA) program. Through a partnership with the ATA program, this year\u2019s exercise marks the most thorough integration of civilian equities into Flintlock yet. The law enforcement component will build upon the cross-border counterterrorism communication, coordination, and response at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels between military and civilian law enforcement to counter terrorist threats and attacks. In general, the law enforcement integration into Flintlock provides a series of training sessions focusing on tactical rural patrol and crisis response capabilities, counterterrorism investigations, command and communication management, post blast and crime scene investigations, community engagement, and human rights. The State Department will also integrate rule of law engagement and humanitarian border management training into components of the exercise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe State Department is proud to be part of this exercise and values this opportunity for information sharing and integration of civilian law enforcement with the military to increase security sector and multinational interoperability and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and terrorist organizations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tParticipating African nations include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal.

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you, Shaun. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for this on-the-record conference call. We have with us Dr. Peter Navarro, who\u2019s the assistant to the President for trade and manufacturing policy and director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. He is joined by Ambassador Tina Kaidanow. She is the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs here at the Department of State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe call today will be on the updated Conventional Arms Transfer policy and Unmanned Aerial Systems export policy. This call is on the record, but I\u2019d note that the contents of the call will be embargoed until the Conventional Arms Transfer policy is posted on the White House website at approximately 12:00 p.m. today, Thursday, April 19.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019d also like to note that we have with us on the phone Mr. Gregory Kausner. He\u2019s the deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. He\u2019s able to participate with us today. He will be happy to field any questions that are addressed to the DSCA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dr. Navarro. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Thank you. I want to start by thanking the Department of State and the National Security Council for all their tremendous work leading this process over the past year, along with all our interagency partners. This collaboration underscores the President\u2019s vision that economic security is national security. The fact is our allies and partners want to buy American. They know American industries produce the most technologically sophisticated, accurate, and effective defense systems in the world. When we enable our allies and partners to more easily obtain appropriate American defense articles and services, we improve our national security. Partners who procure American weaponry are more capable of fighting alongside us and ultimately more capable of protecting themselves with fewer American boots on the ground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tProviding our allies and partners with greater access to American arms will also reduce their reliance not just on Chinese knockoffs, but also on Russian systems, consistent with the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. For too long we have hamstrung ourselves and limited our ability to provide our allies and partners with the defensive capabilities they require, even when in the U.S. interest. President Trump\u2019s new CAT policy, which reforms the myopic 2014 policy of his predecessor, will ensure that American interests are put first in our own decision making.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe administration\u2019s UAS export policy will level the playing field by enabling U.S. firms to increase their direct sales to authorized allies and partners. By expanding international sales opportunities, U.S. industry will be further incentivized to do what they do best: invest and innovate. This will keep our defense industrial base in the vanguard of emerging defense technologies while creating thousands of additional jobs with good wages and generating substantial export revenues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. aerospace and defense industries contribute almost a trillion dollars annually to our economy and support about 2.5 million jobs while maintaining a significant global trade surplus. As President Trump works to balance our trade with the rest of the world, further strengthening a critical part of our export economy and defense industrial base is a logical and critical step.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019ll now turn it over to Ambassador Kaidanow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Thanks very much. Actually, I\u2019m going to leave that statement because I think it speaks volumes, and maybe just open it up for any further questions. We\u2019re very, very pleased that we now have the opportunity to engage in this conversation. As Dr. Navarro said, it\u2019s been a process that\u2019s taken some time to put together thoughtfully, and we want to be able to talk about it with all of you. So thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> All right, thank you. With that, we\u2019ll turn to our questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do wish to ask a question, please press *1. Our first question is going to come from the line of Matthew Lee from the Associated Press. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi there. Good morning. I just \u2013 I have two brief ones. Number one: What exactly is changing about \u2013 how is it now or going to be easier for allies and partners to buy these drone systems and the other things?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd secondly: Didn\u2019t \u2013 you refer, Dr. Navarro, to the myopic policy of the previous administration. Didn\u2019t this begin, this review with an eye toward easing these restrictions, begin during the previous administration? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Okay, well, I\u2019ll start, and then if Dr. Navarro wants to chime in, he\u2019s welcome to. What I would say is as follows: Let\u2019s remember, again, first of all, there\u2019s the discussion of sort of the wider array of things that fall under the conventional arms treaty \u2013 Conventional Arms Transfer initiative. That is a wider set of things than simply just the UAS policy; we should bear that in mind. And in that instance, or with that regard, what we are explicitly doing there is inserting a definition of economic security, right \u2013 consideration, I should say, of economic security into our broader national security considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo in other words, it\u2019s not that we are necessarily doing one thing. You\u2019re doing a number of things, and I hope that we will be able to talk interactively with industry associations \u2013 that\u2019s part of this effort \u2013 to hear what they have to say about how we can more strategically address some of their concerns and enable them to make sales overseas. That will be done within the very near future. In fact, we\u2019re \u2013 as part of the explicit element here, you\u2019ll see some of this when it comes out in the new NSPM so-called. But at any rate, we will be talking to them within the next 60 days so we can put together a specific work plan to actually implement all of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut \u2013 so in other words, it is efforts to do things a little more strategically. We need to do, as the U.S. Government, a better job of strategic advocacy for some of our companies. We need to think about those areas where we can really enable sales overseas. We need to think about how might they sell things that are a little bit harder to sell. We recognize that because the quality of our product is so high, sometimes, for example, it\u2019s more expensive than others. Well, just because of that, we don\u2019t want to disadvantage them. We\u2019d like to find ways to help enable countries to buy our product even when it may be slightly more expensive and so forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we need to be working with our companies to find the ways for strategic advocacy to do all of these things that will enable them, and we are specifically looking, again, as Dr. Navarro said, at the question of how do we enable these companies, how do we provide economic security for the United States, how do we make sure we\u2019re creating American jobs and American prosperity as part of the larger picture, the balance and responsible policy that we have with regard to all the things we consider when we look at any particular arms sale.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I\u2019m going to leave it there and then Dr. Navarro, if you want to chime in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Again, the fact of the matter here is, although the U.S. leads the way in UAS technology, overly restrictive policies enacted by the previous administration have accelerated an undesirable outcome. Strategic competitors like China are aggressively marketing to and making sales in international markets that are forecast to be worth more than $50 billion a year within the next decade. Already, we are seeing Chinese replicas of American UAS technology deployed on the runways in the Middle East. In June, at the Paris Air Show, China\u2019s Chengdu Aircraft Group featured its Wing Loong II medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS, a clear knockoff of General Atomics Reaper.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBottom line, the policies of the previous administration enabled that, and this administration, consistent with its national security strategy and national defense strategy, is changing that policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Let me \u2013 sorry, just let me add one more thing specific to the UAS policy itself because I mentioned that\u2019s it\u2019s a part of, but it\u2019s an important part of the overall changes under the new CAT policy. We are enabling not just some additional sales of MTCR Category 1; we are actually looking at allowing these companies \u2013 Dr. Navarro mentioned we\u2019re allowing them to go forward and make a function of what we call direct commercial sales \u2013 in other words, to directly make sales to the countries rather than via the U.S. Government. That\u2019s a major change. And we will give them additional space for marketing of these systems and for the eventual sale, assuming that they meet all the other criteria, the sale meets all the other criteria that we would normally consider.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are other things the new policy will do. It\u2019ll eliminate the special scrutiny of laser designators on UAS. That\u2019s one of the things that has hampered the sale of these particular systems. So there\u2019s a number of things within the policy itself that will help enable and widen the space, if you want to call it that, for the sales.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you very much. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question, then, comes from the line of Aaron Mehta from Defense News. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this, guys. A couple of things just to make it clear: So is there any change in the presumption of denial and \u2013 with the unmanned systems? And if so, how is it actually \u2013 if there\u2019s no change, how is it actually different from what the Obama administration set up in 2015 with that standard? And then can you just go into why the laser designator decision was made and what that actually means in terms of being able to sell these things to different countries?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW:</strong> Let me be clear, first of all, that the presumption of denial is not a feature of a particular administration. The presumption of denial comes as a feature of the MTCR regime itself. And the rationale behind it is one that I think is understandable and it still pertains, and that is it is supposed to prevent the proliferation of systems that may indeed cause \u2013 of weapons of mass destruction, in essence, and those systems in particular that might, for example, endanger U.S. troops.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we have to have those considerations in mind and that\u2019s why I say this is a balance policy. It does not change the presumption of denial under the MTCR, okay? It\u2019s \u2013 again, this is a regime that is a multilateral regime and it\u2019s existed for some time. The point is that what we are looking to do is take that presumption of denial, assess it against other factors \u2013 and these are important factors, the ones that I mentioned before, and there will be others \u2013 but the point is that we will work to update the MCTR. That\u2019s another issue. We are looking to ensure that the MTCR keeps pace with the dynamic quality of all of this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s remember that the things that, for example, two or three years ago may have been, again, endangering our troops may have been of concern to us with regard to the spread of weapons of mass destruction, now may have commercial applications. There may be things that, again, over time, do not concern us in quite the same way. So we are looking together with our partners to update the MTCR. That\u2019s an ongoing process. But the existing presumption of denial \u2013 that doesn\u2019t change. What we are doing is \u2013 again, we are widening the space for the companies to do their sales and marketing via direct commercial sales. We\u2019re eliminating some of the specific factors that in the past we looked at when we approved these sales or we didn\u2019t. And what we are doing is ensuring that, again, that the MTCR itself keeps pace with the changes over time that we think are salient and need to be considered.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roxana Tiron from Bloomberg. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. Hi. Thank you for doing this. Two questions, actually: Is there \u2013 are there any considerations given to make sure that some of these arm sales don\u2019t end up to countries that violate human rights? And also, President Trump yesterday said that this could allow sales of weapons to go through in just days, but Congress still has about 30 days to block a proposed sale. Does that change? Is there any change in that as well?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Okay. So let me be very clear. Nothing in the \u2013 this new NSPM that will be issued changes either the existing legal or the regulatory requirements. And we are very respectful of Congress\u2019s role in all of this. Again, we consider them to be our partners and they are the ones that ultimately will authorize a number of these sales, in so far as \u2013 again, we have good consultation with them. There is a process by which all this flows. I won\u2019t get into all the mechanics of that here. I\u2019m happy offline to talk about it, or we can give you a lot more detail on how that all works. But the point is Congress retains its role. Again, no change to the legal or regulatory framework.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the important thing again here to remember \u2013 you asked about human rights. The real question for us \u2013 again, this is a balanced policy. We absolutely look at human rights as one of a set of considerations that we look at. It\u2019s all done \u2013 every sale we do is done on a case-by-case basis. In other words, we look at a whole range of U.S. national security objectives. Dr. Navarro talked about some of them. We are looking, again, at the \u2013 we are looking at the \u2013 again, the entire range. And let\u2019s remember, U.S. national security make \u2013 is comprised \u2013 may be comprised of a whole set of things. We look at democracy, at governance, at human rights, at economic development, at security, at the creation of U.S. national \u2013 or U.S. jobs and American prosperity. We look at all those things, with an emphasis on making sure that, again, companies can operate in that space, that they have every opportunity to do their business within that set of considerations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn human rights specifically, let me just mention we have been very, very focused, especially in this administration and in tandem with Congress, on trying to give our partners, our strategic partners overseas, the ability to avoid civilian causalities especially where we can. I know that\u2019s the focus of \u2013 in Congress and the wider array of public opinion. This is really important. We need to give them an understanding \u2013 using some of our experience, give them an understanding of how to minimize civilian causalities to the extent possible when they are doing their operations overseas. That\u2019s critically important to us. I really want to emphasize that, because, again, we have focused on it so very hard over the last little while, especially with Congress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> Yeah. Let me echo what Ambassador Kaidanow said, because it\u2019s so important. The new policy clearly and strongly recognizes the need for responsible balance. And just some of the key issues include human rights, nonproliferation, as well as safeguards against the transfer of our technology, the theft of that, to bad actors. And the safeguards that are put in place include things like prescreening, principles of proper use, training and support, and a continuation of stringent end-use monitoring. So this is a key part of President Trump\u2019s new policies. And again, as Ambassador Kaidanow said, they require enhanced end-use monitoring, directing the federal government to work with partners in reducing civilian causalities in conflict, and championing principles of human rights and international law, including the law of armed conflict. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Let me \u2013 sorry, just to add one thing, and again, to emphasize \u2013 this is so salient and Dr. Navarro just mentioned it again, but this is the first time that minimizing civilian casualties indeed will be an affirmative part of our conventional arms policy. So that really is a change, and it\u2019s an important change, and is one that I think we\u2019re incredibly focused on as we do our work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Stone from Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks for doing this. What is the number of jobs that will be created by this? And what is the estimated dollar amount that defense exports will go up, making them go from X to Y?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN:</strong> Dr. Navarro?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO:</strong> So we\u2019re going to say at the general 30,000-foot level. This will all be a function of how the sales go forward and through the review process. So that would merely be speculation at this point. What we do know is that this will provide the American industry with expanded opportunities, and that\u2019s the signature of President Trump\u2019s administration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Your next question\u2019s coming from the line of Charles Forrester from Jane\u2019s. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Good afternoon, or morning rather. Thank you very much for doing this. Question for you is regarding offset technology transfer. Now some of the markets that you\u2019ve mentioned here, in the Middle East and India for example, very strong on technology transfer and getting some of that work done out there as part of a package deal. How do you see that reconciling with the new policy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>Well, what I would say is with regard to \u2013 first of all, I think you know that in certain particular instances, we are \u2013 we allow the companies to do the actual negotiations with regard to offsets and other requirements and so forth. The U.S. Government itself doesn\u2019t get in the middle of that set of negotiations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut again, let\u2019s remember that what the NSPM will call for is within 60 days we are apt to produce a work plan. And that work plan, again, will be done and created in conjunction with a number of these companies and with some of the industry associations. In putting it together, we will be looking at a whole array of things, not just coproduction but, again, things that will enable sales overseas: strategic efforts to create an environment in which our companies can push back against foreign competitors, make our products as competitive as possible, advance sales, all those things that we want to be doing. Financing advocacy \u2013 in other words, looking at ways that we might, again, if our product ends up being slightly more expensive because it is better, then how do we enable countries to really do that so that they can purchase those systems. So there\u2019s a whole array of things that may come. We\u2019re going to have that conversation with companies, but it\u2019s important that we look at that whole array of things in order to give us a better understanding of where we can be most effective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our last --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR NAVARRO: </strong>I would just add to that the organizational culture of the Trump administration is: buy American, hire American. These are the two simple rules that President Trump has repeatedly stressed, and be assured that this administration will be encouraging private defense industry to embrace those principles as it goes forward with its expanded opportunities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>Okay. We\u2019ll take our last question now, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>OPERATOR: </strong>Thank you. Then our final question will come from Aaron Mehta from Defense News. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi, you guys. Sorry. I just wanted to follow up on the laser designation question from earlier. What is actually being changed about that? Why does that change matter? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KAIDANOW: </strong>So basically what it means is that we\u2019ll be reducing the complications to how we classify UAS. Because under the previous policy, UAS equipped with so-called strike-enabling technology, like laser target designators, were classified under a specific, discrete category. And the criteria for transferring that category of UAS was equivalent to the criteria for transferring an armed UAS. So we placed the proposed transfer of UASs equipped with strike-enabling technologies under significant scrutiny in the past, and we limited their transfer to occur only through the Foreign Military Sale system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat approach caused a lot of confusion within industry and our partners, so the new policy does away with this category of quote-un-quote striking-enabling, and those technologies that were previously classified as such are now treated as unarmed, essentially. So eliminating that kind of distinction makes it easier, or makes it so that U.S. industry faces fewer barriers and less confusion when they\u2019re attempting to compete against other countries in marketing and selling those similar systems to our partners. So what it does is it allows them effectively to sell you UAS with laser target designators via direct commercial sale, which, as I mentioned previously, can potentially allow for faster procurement by those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>And before we close, I just want to offer Mr. Kausner from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency an opportunity to comment on any of the topics raised, if he has any comments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR KAUSNER: </strong>Nothing to add. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MR GREENAN: </strong>All right. Terrific. Well with that then, we\u2019ll conclude the call. I remind everyone that the contents of the call is on the record, but embargoed until the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy is posted on the White House website. That link was provided in the advisory sent out for this call, and we expect that will be around 12:00 p.m. noon today, Thursday April 19th. Thank you everyone, and have an enjoyable day.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for coming, especially on a Friday. Today the State Department released the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Promoting freedom \u2013 promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms are central to who we are as a country, and the United States will continue to support those around the world struggling for human dignity and liberty.\n\n\n<p>\n\tThis is the 42nd annual Human Rights Report that the department has now released. We\u2019re delighted to have our Acting Secretary of State, John Sullivan, with us here today to say a few words about this report. After Acting Secretary Sullivan\u2019s remarks, we will invite Ambassador Michael Kozak to the podium to answer some of your questions. I will help facilitate, as we all know one another, and assist with that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak is a senior bureau official with the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and he\u2019s looking forward to speaking with you shortly. He has served this department under Republican and Democrat administrations for 46 years, which is incredible. Sir, thank you for your service to the State Department.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will hand over the podium to our Acting Secretary John Sullivan. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN: </strong>Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s an honor to be here to formally release the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Now in their 42nd year, these reports are a natural outgrowth of our values as Americans. The founding documents of our country speak to unalienable rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law \u2013 revolutionary concepts at the time of our founding that are now woven into the fabric of America and its interests both at home and abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPromoting human rights and the idea that every person has inherent dignity is a core element of this administration\u2019s foreign policy. It also strengthens U.S. national security by fostering greater peace, stability, and prosperity around the world. The Human Rights Reports are the most comprehensive and factual accounting of the global state of human rights. They help our government and others formulate policies and encourage both friends and foes to respect the dignity of all individuals without discrimination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, we have sharpened the focus of the report to be more responsive to statutory reporting requirements and more focused on government action or inaction with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights. For example, each executive summary includes a paragraph to note the most egregious abuses that occurred in a particular country, including those against women, LGBTI persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous persons, and members of religious minorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBefore I turn the podium over to Mike, I\u2019d like to discuss a few countries in particular, including some with the most egregious human rights records.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe entire world is aware of the horrendous human rights abuses in Syria, including barrel bombing of civilians, attacks on hospitals, widespread reports of rape and abuse by Syrian Government personnel. A week ago, the President took action, together with our French and British allies, to deter the use of chemical weapons and protect the human rights of Syrian civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe condemn the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Burma and the atrocities committed against them, and we are working with partners to address that crisis. More than 670,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in recent months. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been internally displaced. Those responsible for the violations, abuses, and attacks must be held accountable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe DPRK is one of the most repressive and abusive regimes in the world. As the report makes clear, the Kim regime systematically neglects the well-being of its people to underwrite and fund its illicit weapons programs via forced labor, child labor, and the export of North Korean workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina continues to spread the worst features of its authoritarian system, including restrictions on activists, civil society, freedom of expression, and the use of arbitrary surveillance. The absence of an independent judiciary, the government\u2019s crackdown in independent lawyers, and tight controls on information undermine the rule of law. We\u2019re particularly concerned about the efforts of Chinese authorities to eliminate the religious, linguistic, and cultural identities of Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists, as well as restrictions on the worship of Christians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian people continue to suffer at the hands of their leaders. The right of peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression are the legitimate expectation of all individuals worldwide. Unfortunately for the Iranian people, these human rights are under attack almost daily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Turkey, the detention of tens of thousands of individuals, including journalists and academics, under an ongoing state of emergency has undermined the rule of law there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Venezuela, the Maduro regime represses the human rights of its people and denies them the right to have a voice in their government. Thousands flee their homes daily in response to this growing humanitarian crisis. At the Summit of the Americas last week, Vice President Pence announced $16 million in humanitarian aid from the United States to help those who have fled Venezuela, are in \u2013 and are in desperate need of food, water, and medical help. We stand by the Venezuelan people even as their leaders refuse to allow aid into the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, the Russian Government continues to quash dissent and civil society, even while it invades its neighbors and undermines the sovereignty of Western nations. We once again urge Russia to end its brutal occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, to halt the abuses perpetrated by Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and to address impunity for the human rights violations and abuses in the Republic of Chechnya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat\u2019s a brief overview of the factual reports on countries of most concern. I know that Ambassador Kozak will be happy to answer any questions you may have, but before I turn the podium over to him, let me note at least a few bright spots.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUzbekistan \u2013 although there\u2019s still much progress to be made, the country has pursued a strategic reform agenda with positive effects on human rights, including the release of eight high-profile prisoners last year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Liberia, the recent presidential election represents a milestone marking the first peaceful transition from one democratically elected leader to another in more than 70 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Mexico, the general law on forced disappearances established criminal penalties for persons convicted of forced disappearance and a national framework to find victims.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese represent a few of the more positive examples noted in the reports which are released today. We hope to see many more positive accounts of countries taking serious action to improve the human rights record in the reports next year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn conclusion, let me say America leads the way globally to promote human rights. We will also continue to impose consequences on those who abuse human rights. Over the past year, through the Russia Magnitsky and Global Magnitsky sanctions programs, we have undertaken some of our most aggressive measures yet. No human rights abuser, no matter where in the world, is out of our reach. The Human Rights Reports are a significant part of that overall effort. Creating them is an enormous undertaking and not for the fainthearted. I\u2019m grateful to so many of my colleagues in the State Department, including those here in Washington and many others in embassies and consulates around the world, who\u2019ve made these reports possible and contribute to America\u2019s longstanding leadership in promoting human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019d like to turn the podium over to Acting Under Secretary Nauert and to my friend and colleague, Ambassador Mike Kozak. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

So thank you very much. One second. Sir, come on up. Thank you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s start our first question with the Associated Press\u2019s Matt Lee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. I realize that this report doesn\u2019t cover the United States and \u2013 but in this preface and in his comments just now, Acting Secretary Sullivan talked about how the U.S. is promoting \u2013 promotes and defends rights, and that that\u2019s central to us as a country, and that the United States will lead other nations by example in promoting rule of law and respect for human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering how effective you think that you can be in leading by example when you take \u2013 you accuse numerous \u2013 there \u2013 a lot of countries of, say, assaults on press freedom when here, in this country, we have a President who routinely excoriates the press, calling individual media outlets \u2013 and individual reporters sometimes \u2013 fake news. I\u2019m wondering how you can criticize countries for discrimination against LGBT people when this administration\u2019s stated policy is to exclude transgender people from serving in the military. I\u2019m wondering about discrimination of \u2013 criticism of other countries for discriminating against religious minorities when courts and a lot of critics see the travel ban as, in fact, a ban on one particular religion. And lastly, you criticize countries for the mistreatment and refoulement of refugees, which I suppose this administration is not in that great of a position to do because it doesn\u2019t accept hardly any refugees, or at least far fewer than it ever did before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how is this not \u2013 how do you not open yourself up to charges of hypocrisy, and how effective do you think you can be at leading by example? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s see if I can remember each one of those. But I think as you go through the report, you\u2019ll see the countries that we criticize for limiting press freedom, it\u2019s for things like having criminal libel laws where you can be put in jail for what you say. It\u2019s for things like yanking the licenses of media outlets you don\u2019t like or, in many cases, killing the journalists. So I think we make quite a distinction between political leaders being able to speak out and say that that story was not accurate or using even stronger words sometimes, and using state power to prevent the journalists from continuing to do their work. So I think there\u2019s an example there, and we\u2019ve used that with many of our colleagues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe other end of your stream was refoulement, which is a legal term. It\u2019s sending somebody back to a place where they are \u2013 where you know they\u2019re going to be persecuted or where they have a well-founded fear of persecution without going through due process to assess the risk to them. And of course, our law provides that people have rights of appeal through the immigration courts system and into the federal courts if they think they\u2019re going to be. So it doesn\u2019t go to the quantity of refugees; it goes to whether you\u2019re --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, I understand. But you\u2019re not in a position if you even wanted to refoule a refugee, you don\u2019t have many to do it to. But it\u2019s also mistreatment of refugees. It\u2019s not just that. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah, and that usually involves, as you\u2019ll find documented in many countries in the report, physical mistreatment of refugees and that kind of thing. Your --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> LGBT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> LGBT. As we are very clear in the reports, and this has been U.S. policy for some time, the things we\u2019re focused on are is: Has the government in question criminalized same-sex sexual activity, and that\u2019s highlighted now right up front in the reports; have they failed to prevent violence against people because of their LGBT status, or the same applies to ethnic groups and religious and so on; and then, third, discrimination in housing, employment, and government services. Usually, military and police are a slightly different form of government employment. So you can have a debate about that one, but most of the other countries where we\u2019re criticizing them, I think we would be very happy if they were following the procedures we are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of policy decisions in these areas that governments make that aren\u2019t internationally recognized human rights, so that\u2019s where we try to distinguish. And that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s nothing new. That\u2019s been the case in the last couple of administrations as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michelle from CNN.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I\u2019d like to know if you think that such statements in the United States weaken the impact of this report, because the American President has called the press an enemy of the people. And I think at one point he called for a closer look at libel laws or something like that. Do you think in the eyes of people that are looking at this report, as an example and as a resource, do statements like that currently weaken its impact?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think the report is very clear about the kinds of things that we consider to be inappropriate restrictions on freedom of the media \u2013 as I mentioned, using the legal system to go after members of the press, using physical force and so on. It doesn\u2019t go to the nature of discourse in a country. And you can have your own judgments as to how \u2013 how strong a statement might or might not be, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have a hard time explaining that in a lot of places. When you talk to some of my friends in Cuba, for example, who try to be independent journalists there and are routinely slapped around, they also get called names, but they \u2013 I think if it were limited to that they\u2019d be pretty happy as compared to the situation now. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when the State Department is talking about this represents our values as Americans, the removal of sections on women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 why is that not included in values as Americans?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> There\u2019s still a long section on women. And by the way, if you look elsewhere in the report, I mean, women are also activists, are also journalists. There are \u2013 yeah, now --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Understood. But it\u2019s so conspicuous that it\u2019s removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Let me \u2013 now, it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to explain why it was removed. It was introduced six years ago into the report. It hadn\u2019t been there before. The \u2013 it\u2019s one of the few terms that are used in the report that isn\u2019t derived from an international treaty that has a definition or derived from U.S. law, where there\u2019s a clear definition to the term.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in this case, the previous administration intended it to mean look at the availability of contraception, at the \u2013 whether the government tried to impose or coerce people in making decisions about reproduction. In the statements that were made \u2013 this was derived from the Beijing Declaration that was done in the \u201890s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt that time, it was very clear and our delegation made a very clear statement that this has nothing to do with abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion. Unfortunately, over the last few years, groups on both sides of that issue domestically have started to use the term, and both seem to think it does include abortion and then argue about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo our thought was let\u2019s just not use a term that has the opposite meaning from the one we intend. We went back to the term that\u2019s used in the U.S. statute that requires the Human Rights Report, which is coerced family planning, namely coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI might mention too, because I went back and looked at last year\u2019s report, the question being asked was, \u201cWere there obstacles opposed to getting contraception information and means?\u201d The answer in virtually every country was no, there were no obstacles other than, in almost every country, including our own, the availability in rural areas is less than it is in urban areas. But we were taking a lot of space to explain that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve kept that information in there. We\u2019ve done it now by a hyperlink. We used to take that information from the WHO report and put it in. We said let\u2019s just use a hyperlink, and then there\u2019s actually more information available that way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the rationale behind that. It\u2019s not a diminishment of women\u2019s rights or a desire to get away from it; it was to stop using a term that has several different meanings that are not all the ones we intend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Dave Clark from AFP.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you very much. When countries around the world are looking at the U.S. for leadership on human rights, should they be looking at this report, or should they be looking at President Trump\u2019s embrace of Rodrigo Duterte, of meeting with Sisi, and with the very warm relations with Mohammed bin Salman, who runs a country where women have no rights at all? Is \u2013 what sends the stronger signal, the President\u2019s close personal friendship with Xi Jinping and his golf tours at Mar-a-Lago or you at that podium decrying human rights abuses?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, this is a official report, and by the way, I think it\u2019s one of the most widely read U.S. Government documents in the world when we do the hit counts on the internet. It\u2019s put out in the name of the Secretary of State, who was just here to deliver it, and he certainly is reflecting the President in this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think this is showing what we assess to be the human rights situation in all of the countries you\u2019ve just mentioned, including \u2013 now even more so \u2013 the responsibility of the government for the abuses that are occurring there. They\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not just saying there are these societal problems in the country; we\u2019re saying the government either has done these bad deeds or not. And I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Russia we highlighted the fact \u2013 their response to an increase in domestic violence there \u2013 and they have a terrible problem, I mean tens of thousands of deaths of women being killed in domestic disputes every year. But since it went up, the government spokesman who went into the State Duma said, \u201cWell, we have to decriminalize this, because it\u2019s better that our women be beaten than that our men be humiliated by their behavior.\u201d So \u2013 and this was Putin\u2019s party, they decriminalized spousal beating. So not a very good thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, does that mean that the President should never speak to these people? This is what \u2013 we\u2019re trying to keep the report as the factual baseline for what we\u2019re going to do in policy terms or sanctions as the secretary was mentioning. So we can learn a lot from this, and we can use it to formulate a policy. But usually part of your policy is engaging with the people whose behavior you\u2019re trying to change at some level. And I don\u2019t think those two things are in distinction. The fact is, these other governments and their populations do read the report, and I don\u2019t think they discount it because the President speaks with their leader or otherwise. And when the President speaks to their leader, often he\u2019s talking about these issues, so it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s complementary, it\u2019s not a \u2013 two things that are in conflict\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Since we\u2019re citing examples, what does Saudi law say about spousal abuse?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Saudi law is very, very restrictive on women. We\u2019ve tried to encourage changes in that, we\u2019ve seen the minor changes that are reflected in the report, that they\u2019ve started to say they\u2019re going to allow women to drive cars and so on. That isn\u2019t very much, but it is a baby step in the right direction, and we\u2019re trying to encourage more of that kind of reform at the same time that we\u2019re calling out the areas in which they\u2019re deficient, which are many.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>All right, Rich Hudson from Fox News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks, Heather. Ambassador, I want to follow up a little bit on Saudi Arabia, the conversation you were just having with Dave. You note in the report \u2013 and a lot has happened on the government level in Saudi Arabia in just the past year, and you note in the report the jailing or hoteling of 200 officials there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Yep. Hoteling, that\u2019s a good \u2013 (laughter).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are you \u2013 overall, in Saudi Arabia, are you encouraged by some of the things that are happening? Are you discouraged by what\u2019s happened over the last year? Where do you see the trend going in Saudi Arabia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, of course it\u2019s always hard to predict trends, but I think \u2013 I\u2019m always encouraged when you start to see things break out of a static holding pattern. When you see a little bit of change as we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia, and the hoteling was connected to \u2013 ostensibly anyway \u2013 to more of concern about corruption, which is not \u2013 another one of our issues, insofar as corruption and human rights abuse seem to \u2013 tend to go together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re trying to encourage that kind of movement on the part of the Saudis. At the same time, you can look at that and say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t do this with sufficient due process,\u201d and I think that\u2019s also well spelled-out here. So it\u2019s trying to get that right balance of, hey here\u2019s where we think you\u2019re deficient, but we\u2019re seeing some movement and we\u2019re trying to encourage the movement in the positive direction and see more. But I\u2019m usually more encouraged when I see some movement going on than when things are just stuck in the same rut for years and years and years. So in that sense, at least there\u2019s an opportunity there. We\u2019ll see if it comes to anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>So is hoteling now going to be standard language in --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>I think your colleague just came up with a new term with --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Cindy with Voice of America. We have a few minutes left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, thank you. We were talking about press freedoms, and you\u2019re probably aware that in Nicaragua, the Ortega Government ordered at least five television stations off the air for their coverage of massive protests. What is the U.S. Government prepared to do to stem this new wave of repression?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, Nicaragua is \u2013 and I think if you looked at the report \u2013 is going to wrong direction on many fronts and that is one of them, of media freedom. But also on all the basics, I mean, it\u2019s a long litany of torture, extrajudicial killing, the elections were a sham. And so we\u2019ve put more and more pressure on \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see some of the sanctions programs will start to affect some people in that country. But it\u2019s a tough one; the Ortega Government has basically shut down a lot of the opposition, a lot of the independent civil society organizations as well as the free media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I mean, in our policy everywhere, and certainly in Nicaragua, is to try to provide both moral \u2013 and to the extent we can support NGOs and so on that are working to keep \u2013 to help them keep working, help free media keep working, and bring about a change in that dimension. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s tough, but we can\u2019t do it ourselves. We have to be in a position of supporting the people in those countries that are trying to bring about change, and we try to do that through a variety of means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he met with any Nicaraguans \u2013 but at the Summit of the Americas had meetings with civil society activists from Cuba, Venezuela \u2013 same camp as Nicaragua \u2013 and it was in part just to give them that \u2013 show that we stand with them and that we\u2019re trying to be supportive of what they\u2019re trying to do to bring about change in their own country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question about Gaza and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Janne. Janne, go right \u2013 excuse me, Janne, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korean human rights issues, as the North Korean nuclear issue is an important issue and the North Korean human rights is also serious issues, unless the regime of the North Korean Kim Jong-un changes, the North Korean human rights abuse against the North Korean people will continue. What is the U.S. solutions on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay. We have \u2013 I mean, we are concerned about the nuclear issue in North Korea, but we\u2019re equally concerned about the human rights issues, and they both derive from the same problem. And I think you see in the report we\u2019ve laid out pretty starkly the kinds of abuses, and over the last year or two, we\u2019ve supported, like, a commission of inquiry on North Korea, we support NGOs that are working on North Korea and exposing the human rights abuses that occur in the camps there and so on. But some of the stories that are contained in the report are just overwhelming. There\u2019s one about 11 people who were arrested for supposedly making a pornographic film and they were executed by shooting anti-artillery weapons at them, and then they brought out tanks and ran over the bodies, and this is supposed to be a civilized country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t think you will see a diminishment in our concern about that issue even as we try to work the nuclear issue. It\u2019s not a trade-off. I think the President\u2019s laid out a vision there that North Korea can get on a much better path, but it needs to make progress across the board, not just on one issue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, thank you. Sir, you \u2013 the report considers China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea forces of instability. What do you mean by that? And will there be any consequences?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve called them as forces of instability in the report. Perhaps --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, in the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> In the preface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> In the preface. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, exactly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think that has to do with their international behavior as well as their internal behavior. I mean, sometimes, internal behavior \u2013 you can\u2019t really separate them because when you start oppressing your own people, you generate refugee flows, you generate humanitarian crises like you\u2019re seeing in Venezuela, for example. So \u2013 but there\u2019s not \u2013 saying something is a force of instability is saying or characterizing a set of facts. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a prescribed policy flow. None of this does.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis report doesn\u2019t say countries that reach a certain level we\u2019re going to cut off aid or something like that. It\u2019s the factual predicate for making those decisions, but those are policy decisions where the President and his advisors will have to weigh a whole number of factors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> And our final question --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask \u2013 can I ask a question on the Gaza and the West Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> -- Kylie from CBS News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because, I mean, he pointed to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just go back to the reproductive rights for a second? So you said there are no obstacles for women to get contraception in any country except for if there\u2019s a remote issue, right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> I said with some exceptions, and the exceptions were and still are \u2013 and we\u2019ve really gotten at it by flipping back to the original U.S. statutory language. It\u2019s in places like China, where in order to enforce their two \u2013 now two-child policy, that there are reports of coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization. In North Korea, where the government also coerces or forces abortion \u2013 although sometimes that\u2019s for political punishment rather than family planning. And we uncovered it \u2013 so as we were digging through trying to reduce the bulk of some of this report, I found in the old country I served in, in Belarus, that it turns out that the doctors in the state hospitals, and particularly in the institutions there, if they have a woman who is pregnant and who is a woman with disabilities, the doctors insist on an abortion. Or if they believe the fetus has a disability, they\u2019ll insist on an abortion. So we\u2019ve called that out too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not \u2013 those were the cases, though, in the \u2013 under the previous formula where you would say there was a restriction on family planning, freedom of family planning. For most countries, it said, there isn\u2019t any restriction except for the ones imposed by economics and rural-urban type thing. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So just to be clear just on that, so taking out the language about those cases therefore means that the U.S. doesn\u2019t believe that the inability for women to get an abortion physically or by law is an abuse of human rights?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> That \u2013 correct under the previous administration and this one and the one before that. We have never taken the position that abortion was a right under \u2013 a human right under international law. This is supposed to be internationally recognized human rights, and it\u2019s an issue on which \u2013 some countries prohibit abortion, some countries, like our own, pretty much no restriction on it, and we don\u2019t say one of those is right and one of those is wrong. We don\u2019t report on it because it\u2019s not a human right. It\u2019s an issue of great policy debate, you can have a good discussion, but there\u2019s no internationally recognized standard as to what\u2019s the right treatment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the other, yes. The \u2013 it is internationally recognized that somebody shouldn\u2019t coerce you to have an abortion or force you to be sterilized, so that\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Thank you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question on the Palestinian --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We \u2013 the ambassador has to go. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, one quick question on the Palestinian (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We have to go. Sir, thank you. Thank you. We\u2019ll get you another time.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "official_title": "Acting\u00a0Secretary of State",
        "date": "April 23, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here in Toronto for the G7 ministerial meeting. Toronto is a beautiful city (inaudible) and lovely weather, beautiful facilities here at the university. Very grateful for our hosts here. The Government of Canada and Foreign Minister Freeland has put together a terrific program for us. So on behalf of the United States and President Trump, I want to extend our sincerest appreciation to Canada and to Prime Minister Trudeau and Foreign Minister Freeland for their active leadership of the G7.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States wholeheartedly supports the emphasis of our Canadian host on building a more peaceful and secure world for all. We also applaud Canada\u2019s efforts to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through strategic partnerships that seek to tackle challenges faced by women across the globe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur conversations over the past few days have been very productive, and the U.S. remains committed to working closely with our G7 partners on all of the critical issues that we discussed, and we look forward to our leaders building upon our conversations when they gather in Charlevoix in June for the G7 leaders\u2019 conference.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmong the number of shared priorities discussed is our collective commitment to counter transnational terrorists and the criminal networks supporting them. While we have made significant gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in cyberspace and in other countries, we cannot stand idly by and assume that it is defeated. We must remain vigilant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also remain united in opposition to the DPRK\u2019s continued development of unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs. We call for all countries around the world to take action and reinforce this message to Pyongyang and to rigorously enforce the UN Security Council resolutions. International unity is essential as we continue to push diplomatic and economic pressure until the DPRK concedes to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe G7 countries reaffirm our message to Iran to adhere to international norms and strictly abide by its nuclear-rated \u2013 nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA. The United States calls on all of our partners to continue working alongside us as we counter Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and hold the Iranian Government accountable for their actions: supporting terrorist organizations, launching cyber attacks, threatening international shipping interests, and committing unconscionable human rights abuses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSyria was another prominent topic of discussion. On April 13th, the United States, France, and the UK launched strikes on three targets in Syria. These military actions taken together with our allies were a response to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons to kill and injure hundreds of its own people. The images of dead and dying children following the Syrian regime\u2019s most recent chemical attack represented a call to action among the world\u2019s civilized nations. The response of the United States and our key partners was not simply to hold Assad and other Syrian regime officials accountable for the atrocities committed, but also to degrade the regime\u2019s capability to commit them and to deter the use of chemical weapons in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe want to ensure that malicious regimes and terrorists understand this message of deterrence. We\u2019re committed to completing the fight against ISIS and rooting out its remaining havens. The U.S. will remain committed in Syria until ISIS is defeated and the so-called caliphate completely eliminated. We will work to ensure local\u00a0forces enabled by our regional partners and allies will consolidate these gains, stabilize liberated territories, and prevent the return of ISIS. We will not leave a vacuum that can be exploited by the Assad regime and its supporters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn parallel, we will work with our partners to invigorate the Geneva political process pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and to mobilize the resources needed to address Syria\u2019s urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs. We will seek further contributions in forces, materiel, and money from regional partners and allies in order to sustain the effort in Syria and stabilize liberated territories.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs we work to advance the political process, the United States is committed to ensuring that all Syrians, including the Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Christians, Turkmen, and other minorities in northeast Syria, have a full seat at the table and an appropriate say in their future pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe G7 countries agree that Russia must stop creating impediments to peace and abide by the commitments it entered into under UN Security Council Resolution 2401 and compel the Assad regime to do the same. Russia must be a constructive partner in Syria or will be held accountable. We also stand united in our commitment to hold Russia accountable for its activities in Ukraine. Together, the G7 call on Russia to honor its Minsk commitments, to de-escalate violence, and to return control of Crimea to Ukraine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the issues of collective concern I\u2019ve just outlined, over the past few days we also discussed our solidarity on Venezuela, Libya, and many other critical issues on the forefront of the international agenda, including the humanitarian crisis in Burma. Nearly 700,000 people, mostly Rohingya women and children, have fled violence in Burma since August, bringing the total number of refugees hosted in Bangladesh to approximately one million.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn response to this dire situation, I am announcing today that we are providing an additional $50 million in humanitarian assistance from our Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration to support a UN-led joint response plan in Bangladesh. This brings the United States response to the Rakhine State crisis in Burma and Bangladesh to more than $163 million since August 2017 and total humanitarian assistance for displaced people in and from Burma to more than $255 million since October 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis assistance will support refugees in Bangladeshi host communities to provide protection, emergency shelter, water, sanitation, health care, and psychological support for people affected by the conflict, as well as to prepare for the impending monsoon and cyclone season, which has the potential to bring significant loss of life, shelter, and access to critical services. We urge other donors to join us in providing additional humanitarian assistance for those affected by this crisis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith those observations on the topics we\u2019ve covered here at the G7 ministerial meeting, I look forward to taking your questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. And with that, we\u2019ll start with Dave Clark from AFP. Dave, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you. Thank you very much. You mentioned in your comments that the G7 members agreed on the importance of holding Iran to its commitments under the JCPOA. Were you able to give a commitment to your allies here that the United States will live up to its commitments under the JCPOA, and in particular to maintain the sanctions waiver on the nuclear-related sanctions after May the 12th? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Thank you. Well, as you know, this has been a topic of discussion with our E3 partners. The United States has significant concerns with Iran and its ballistic missiles program, its destabilizing and malign influence in the region \u2013 in Yemen, in Syria, and elsewhere \u2013 and concerns we have with the JCPOA itself, including its sunset clauses.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump is concerned, very concerned, about Iran\u2019s behavior, malign behavior. His ultimate concern with the JCPOA is the concern for nonproliferation. We \u2013 no one wants to see a nuclear-armed Iran. President Trump\u2019s goal in this entire process is to strengthen the JCPOA if it can be strengthened and to protect America and American interests which have been threatened for over 40 years by the regime in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve lived through my family with. My uncle was the last U.S. ambassador to Iran. He left Tehran \u2013 fortunately for him and my family \u2013 in the summer of 1979 before his staff was taken hostage on November 4th, 1979 and held in violation of all international norms and basic, basic human dignity, for 444 days by that regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re well aware of the problems and the destabilizing and malign influence of Iran, and the President is committed to addressing it. We have discussed that at length with our partners here at the G7 ministerial.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you. And our next question goes to Mike Blanchfield from the Canadian Press. Hi, Mike.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Mr. Secretary, we heard earlier today from Boris Johnson and Chrystia Freeland on the G7 efforts on \u2013 to call out Russia for its interference in democratic institutions. They\u2019ve talked about a working group that is going to report to the leaders and going to urge them to speak out against the influence of Russia. Russia is a politically charged topic in your country, obviously, especially with the Mueller investigation. How \u2013 how committed is your government to this G7 endeavor, and how likely is it that we\u2019ll see President Trump here in Charlevoix standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these G8 \u2013 the G7 leaders in calling out Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Well, you made a reference there \u2013 you caught yourself when referring to the G8. It\u2019s no longer the G8 for a reason. It\u2019s the G7. We\u2019re committed to addressing all of the abhorrent behavior that we have witnessed particularly recently by Russia, whether it\u2019s at Salisbury, its support for the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has not just undertaken with its \u2013 with its allies and partners in the G7 to make statements about this behavior; we have undertaken significant actions in response. As you know, we expelled a large number of undeclared Russian intelligence agents from the United States, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russian oligarchs and Russian institutions, enterprises. So we have taken action. We stand with our G7 allies in confronting Russian malign behavior where \u2013 wherever we see it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, we also want to work with Russia in areas where we can and need to work with Russia, whether it\u2019s on stability, New START talks, INF Treaty \u2013 treaty violation, actually, by the Russians which we need to \u2013 need to address, counterterrorism. There are any number of areas where we still need to have a dialogue with Russia, but that will not prevent us from standing up and confronting and taking action against Russian behavior that\u2019s contrary to international norms and all that we stand for in the G7. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Sir, thank you. Thank you, everyone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN:</strong> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "date": "May 13, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And joining us now, the new and very busy Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Good morning, Chris. It\u2019s great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let\u2019s start with breaking news. First of all, that savage attack last night in Paris, a Chechen knifing killing one person, wounding four others. What can you tell us about a possible link to terror?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, we don\u2019t know much more. We know that the caliphate ISIS has claimed responsibility. They said he was one of their soldiers. We can\u2019t verify that yet. The French authorities, with all the intelligence help the United States can provide, we\u2019ll do our best to unpack this in the coming hours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s talk about some other breaking news. The North Koreans announced yesterday that they are going to blow up their nuclear site in 10 to 12 days. How big a development is this, and is that, do we believe, their only nuclear test site?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, it\u2019s good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world. And so this is one step along the way. I had a good set of meetings this past week aimed at heading in exactly this direction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to go back to the comment \u2013 and Kevin just played it \u2013 your comment on Friday that if Kim chooses the, quote, \u201cright path,\u201d the U.S. is prepared to work with North Korea to, quote, \u201cachieve prosperity.\u201d What does that mean in terms of direct U.S. investment in North Korea? And are we, as part of this, willing, in effect, to guarantee Kim\u2019s security, that regime change will be off the table?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, here\u2019s what this will look like. This will be Americans coming in \u2013 private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer \u2013 private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid \u2013 they need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. Those are the kind of things that, if we get what it is the President has demanded \u2013 the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea \u2013 that the American people will offer in spades.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And as part of that, are we, in effect, saying to Kim, \u201cIf you give us what we want, you can stay on in power?\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> We will have to provide security assurances to be sure. This has been a tradeoff that has been pending for 25 years. No president has ever put America in a position where the North Korean leadership thought that this was truly possible, that the Americans would actually do this, would lead to the place where America was no longer held at risk by the North Korean regime. That\u2019s the objectives. When I said earlier this week that I think Chairman Kim shares the objectives with the American people, I am convinced of that. Now the task is for President Trump and he to meet to validate the process by which this would go forward, to set out those markers so that we can negotiate this outcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any problem, given Kim\u2019s history and the history of his family as an oppressive regime, any problems with the idea of the U.S., even if we get our deal, in effect, giving a security guarantee to the Kim regime?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, we\u2019ll have to see how the negotiations proceed, but make no mistake about it: America\u2019s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or into the very place we\u2019re sitting here this morning, Chris. That\u2019s our objective, that\u2019s the end state the President has laid out, and that\u2019s the mission that he sent me on this past week to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about denuclearization, the objective. Two weeks ago, National Security Advisor John Bolton sat in this very seat, and he told me that the U.S. negotiating position going in is that Kim has to ship out, has to dismantle and take out of the country all of his nuclear weapons, all of his nuclear infrastructure, all of his long-range missiles before the U.S. will grant any concessions. On the other hand, this week, Kim met with Chinese President Xi and he called for, quote, \u201cphased and synchronous measures,\u201d in other words, action for action. Have you and Kim agreed what the sequencing is? Is it all of the actions by him first, or is it step by step? And is that something, as I say, that you\u2019ve agreed with, or is it something that Kim and the President will have to work out at the summit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Chris, we\u2019ve had discussions on how this would proceed. There\u2019s still a great deal of detail to be worked on, and in the coming weeks we will continue to work on that so that we can be in a good spot on June 12th in Singapore for President Trump. But make no mistake about it: We\u2019ve done this before, right? We\u2019ve done trade for trade, moment for moment; you give me X, I give you Y; and it has failed repeatedly. I think Chairman Kim understands that. I think he appreciates the fact that this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before. If we\u2019re going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take truly historic measures to achieve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And how confident are you? Because you\u2019re going to be putting the President of the United States in a room with Kim in Singapore with the whole world watching. How confident are you that not only he understands it, but that he\u2019s going to have to \u2013 that he\u2019s going to deliver on our expectations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, to quote President Trump, we\u2019ll see, right? We are not to the place yet where we should be remotely close to declaring that we have achieved what it is we want. There\u2019s a great deal of work that remains. Our eyes are wide open with respect to the risks. But it is our fervent hope that Chairman Kim wants to make a strategic change, a strategic change in the direction for his country and his people; and if he\u2019s prepared to do that, President Trump is prepared to assure that this could be a successful transition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right, I want to talk about that. You\u2019ve said that we understand, and John Bolton talked about that nobody in the administration is starry-eyed. The President has been raising expectations for the summit, saying he thinks that they\u2019re going to make a great deal \u2013 his phrase. Your predecessor at the CIA, John Brennan, says he thinks that\u2019s playing into Kim\u2019s hands. Take a look:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP: \u201c</strong>I think that we\u2019re going to have a success. I think this will be a very big success.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>MR BRENNAN:</strong> \u201cI think he has been masterful in how he has manipulated perceptions and how he has manipulated and, quite frankly, duped Mr. Trump.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it a mistake for the President to predict a, quote, \u201cgreat success\u201d?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I think Former Director Brennan\u2019s remarks are silly on their face. We\u2019re going to enter into a set of discussions with two nations doing their best to achieve outcomes for their own people that are consistent with their objectives and goals. I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives, and our mission is to prepare the groundwork. And we\u2019re pretty far along the way in doing so, and we\u2019ll continue to work in the days ahead \u2013 30 left \u2013 to prepare for June 12th so the President can have a successful outcome, that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> After you brought the American hostages home and the whole world celebrated that, President Trump praised Kim for releasing them. And that praise \u2013 not the release of the hostages, but that praise \u2013 upset some critics. Take a look at this:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP:</strong> \u201cKim Jong-un did a great service to himself, to his country, by doing this.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<strong>SENATOR SCHUMER:</strong> \u201cWe can\u2019t be fooled into giving the North Korean regime credit for returning Americans that never should have been detained in the first place.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> According to your State Department\u2019s latest report, North Korea still holds at least 80,000 political prisoners in its labor camps and other facilities. Is human rights an issue in this summit, or is this just going to be about the nuclear issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yeah, Chris, this administration is always concerned about human rights. It\u2019s the case not only are there political prisoners that remain in North Korea, there are Americans held around the world by other rogue regimes too. I can assure you this administration \u2013 I saw it in my role as director of the CIA and I\u2019ve seen it now in my first two and a half weeks as Secretary of State \u2013 is intently focused on achieving the return of each of those as well. We had a success this week. We\u2019re happy for those families and for America that those three Americans returned home, but we recognize there\u2019s much work to do. We still have Americans held and we\u2019re working diligently on behalf of each and every one of them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> When people found out that you were going to be on the program today they all had the same question. I must say I did. What is Kim like? With the possible exception of Dennis Rodman, you have spent more time with him than any other Westerner, at least two and a half hours the way I figure it. What is he like? Give us any kind of personal insight. How aware is he of what President Trump has been saying? Was there any mention of Little Rocket Man?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve got a lot fewer rebounds than Dennis Rodman, but I did get to spend a great deal of time with Chairman Kim. The conversations are professional. He knows \u2013 he knows his brief. He knows what the \u2013 what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHe does follow the Western press. He\u2019ll probably watch this show at some point. He\u2019s paying attention to things that the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team will be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u2019s just possible we might pull off a historic undertaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was there any mention of the exchange of insults back and forth?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No, we didn\u2019t cover that, Chris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> That\u2019s probably wise. (Laughter.) I want to turn to \u2013 there\u2019s a lot on your brief. Iran and Israel got into an armed conflict across the Syrian border this week after President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. Do you think that there\u2019s any connection that Iran feels less constrained now that the U.S. no longer is part of this deal about Iran nukes?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s ludicrous. That\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that Iran feels less constrained when during the JCPOA they have now fired missiles into an airport where Americans travel each day in Riyadh, they\u2019ve now fired missiles into Israel; to suggest that somehow the withdrawal from the JCPOA is driving the Iranian conduct that\u2019s taken place during the JCPOA in Yemen, the rise of Hizballah \u2013 all of those things took place during the JCPOA. Indeed, I would argue that they felt they could act with impunity. They watched. They watched Europe put exactly zero sanctions on their missile program during the JCPOA. I think Rouhani and Zarif need to explain why it\u2019s the case that while this agreement was in place Iran continued its march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> President Trump made it clear that he\u2019s not only going after Iran but he\u2019s also prepared to sanction European companies that continue to do business in Tehran. Here is the President: \u201cWe will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the leaders of France, of Germany, of Britain all say that they\u2019re going to stay in the deal and they\u2019re going to look for a way to protect European companies that continue to do business. The question is: How hard is the Trump administration prepared to go after European companies that ignore the U.S. pulling out?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Two things, Chris. First, the wealth that was created in Iran as a result of the JCPOA drove Iranian malign activity. It fueled Qasem Soleimani. It fueled the IRGC. It provided resources for their work in Syria and Iraq. President Trump\u2019s withdrawal is aimed at denying them that wealth, denying them the resources to continue their bad behavior, to take the money away from them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe withdrawal wasn\u2019t aimed at the Europeans. I worked hard over the short time I\u2019ve been the Secretary of State to try and fix the deal. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement with our E3 partners. I am hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works, that really protects the world from Iranian bad behavior, not just their nuclear program but their missiles and their malign behavior as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> And I\u2019ll be working closely with the Europeans to try and achieve that, Chris.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what about if the European companies and the European countries say look, there\u2019s not going to be a renegotiation any more than there\u2019s going to be a renegotiation of the Paris Climate Accord? Is the U.S. prepared to go after companies in our allies like Britain, France, and Germany, if they try to continue to do business?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> The sanctions regime that is now in place is very clear about what the requirements are. My mission that I\u2019ve been given by President Trump is to work to strike a deal that achieves the outcomes that protect America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, and I\u2019ll be hard at it with the Europeans in the next several days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> A couple of final questions. Israel. The U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem tomorrow. The Palestinians are talking about a day of rage, violent mass protests, and the PLO won\u2019t even talk to the U.S. anymore as an interlocutor in terms of the Middle East. Is the peace process dead? And given the threat of violence, what are you as the Secretary of State saying to Americans in the Middle East in those parts of the world over the next few days?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the peace process is most decidedly not dead. We\u2019re hard at work on it. We hope we can achieve a successful outcome there as well. With respect to security, we are aware of the situation on the ground. The United States Government has taken a number of actions to ensure that not only our governmental interests but the American people in that region are secure as well, and we\u2019re comfortable we\u2019ve taken action that reduces that risk.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Finally \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty remarkable given all that\u2019s happened, all that\u2019s on your brief \u2013 you have been Secretary of State for barely two weeks now. What\u2019s your vision for the State Department?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, first, Chris, I hope I haven\u2019t peaked in my first two weeks. (Laughter.) But it\u2019s pretty clear: We\u2019ve got to go put the diplomatic team on the playing field. It should be the United States State Department that is at the front of American foreign policy, delivering solutions to solve America\u2019s problems without resort to military force. And so I\u2019m going to build the team, we\u2019re going to get our swagger back, and the State Department will be out in front in every corner of the world leading America\u2019s diplomatic policy, achieving great outcomes on behalf of President Trump and America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secretary Pompeo, thank you. Thanks for your time in a very busy schedule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Always good to talk with you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you, Chris.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s on-the-record conference call with our director of policy planning, Brian Hook. It\u2019s certainly been a busy week with calls and outreach to our allies and partners in which we\u2019ve been discussing our next steps on Iran. Following this, Secretary Pompeo will deliver a speech on Monday to outline the administration\u2019s overall strategy to counter Iran\u2019s malign influence. Director Hook is here to speak with us today in advance of that speech.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a reminder, this briefing is on the record. It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. Brian has just about 10 minutes to take your questions, so I would encourage you to be brief. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Director Hook for some brief opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks, Heather. Good to be with all of you. Just make a few points here. The Secretary \u2013 Secretary Pompeo will be giving a speech on Monday. It will be his first major foreign policy address as Secretary of State. It will be a very timely address because it is presenting the way forward post the Iran nuclear deal withdrawal. And he\u2019ll be essentially presenting a diplomatic roadmap to achieve a new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal, following the President\u2019s decision to end America\u2019s participation in the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary has had very good phone calls with the ministers, the foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We have been working closely with the Europeans over the last week at various levels of government \u2013 the President, the Secretary of State. I\u2019ve been in touch with the political directors of the E3. We\u2019ve had staff discussion. So we have been in very extensive and deep consultations with the Europeans on the way forward. Our broad approach now that we\u2019ve been emphasizing is that we need a new \u2013 a framework that\u2019s going to address the totality of Iran\u2019s threats. And this involves a range of things around its nuclear program \u2013 missiles, proliferating missiles and missile technology, its support for terrorists, and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we see an opportunity to counter and address Iran\u2019s nuclear and proliferation threats, its destabilizing activity, and to create a better nonproliferation and deterrence architecture for Iran and the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\u2019s broadly the way forward. I\u2019m happy to take some questions. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday; that\u2019s only three days away from now. And he looks forward to presenting a comprehensive strategy toward Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll start with our first question. That\u2019s with Josh Lederman from the Associated Press. Hi, Josh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I just wanted to ask you about the prospects of getting other countries, and particularly the Europeans, to join any kind of coalition. I mean, the Europeans are moving ahead with using the blocking statute; they\u2019re even considering direct transfers to Iran\u2019s central bank. So what makes you think they\u2019re going to join you? And if you don\u2019t get the Europeans or actually any of the P5+1 on board, can this coalition still have enough weight to succeed in bringing Iran back to the table? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that we agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on. During the negotiations with the E3, we made a lot of progress not only \u2013 I mean, just on the nuclear piece, on the \u2013 on sunsets, on ICBMs, on a stronger inspections regime, but also on the regional activities, human rights, the range of missiles that are destabilizing the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we, I think, have the very \u2013 I think we assess the situation very similarly in terms of the wanting to take a comprehensive approach. When President Macron was in the United States he talked about the four pillars, and his \u2013 what he was talking about is a very comprehensive approach. And I think for the last many years, the last three years or so, the JCPOA gave a lot of people a sort of false sense of security that by addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, that we were somehow then addressing the totality of Iranian threats. And it\u2019s important that we \u2013 that we change that dynamic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think that, again, we agree on more than we disagree, and we, as I said, have been working with the Europeans over the last week or two, and just in consultations with them, and we want to continue the momentum from our work with our European allies. And we see this, the coming months, as an opportunity to expand our efforts and to work with a lot of countries who share the same concerns about nonproliferation, about terrorism, about stoking civil wars around the region, and so we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re very hopeful about the \u2013 about the diplomacy ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Brian. Next question, Michael Gordon from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Hi, Michael.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Hook, the diplomats in Europe that I\u2019ve spoken with have said that it\u2019s clear the administration wants tough sanctions, but the administration has yet to spell out in any detail what it \u2013 the arrangements that it thinks should be put in place now that the JCPOA has been scrapped. What specific nuclear constraints do you think are necessary post-JCPOA in the sphere of enrichment or other nuclear activities? And if you can\u2019t say what you want in terms of nuclear constraints, how can you ask the Europeans to impose tough sanctions? You\u2019re asking them to impose tough sanctions but you\u2019ve not defined your goal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think, Michael, that\u2019s part of the reason why the Secretary is giving a speech on Monday. But Brian, I\u2019ll let you take it from here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, that is \u2013 this is \u2013 as I said, this will be the Secretary\u2019s first major foreign policy address. He has decided to make that on Iran. And we will be discussing our vision to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has had a definite military dimension to it, and the Iranians have yet to come clean on the military dimensions of their nuclear activities. That is going to be part \u2013 I mean, obviously with what Israel disclosed recently, that Iran has been protecting and preserving a vast atomic archive while it has been implementing the JCPOA, and of course that increases the relevance of the sunsets. We don\u2019t believe that Iran has earned the trust of the world to have restrictions on its nuclear program lifted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Carol \u2013 sorry, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, go ahead, Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Carol Morello from <i>The Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing this. Say, Donald Tusk said some pretty strong things a couple of days ago about the administration. Basically, I think he said: With friends like this, who needs enemies? But at least we now know if you need a helping hand, you don\u2019t have to go farther than the end of your arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I was wondering what, if anything, that Secretary Pompeo will be doing to address the lingering resentment over Iran. I realize that\u2019s not the only issue, but that\u2019s certainly one. And also, if you could address a little bit of what kind of negotiation do you see with Iran. You seem to be seeking a surrender on their part, not a negotiation. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah. The President expressed his appreciation to our European partners. And we have worked, tried to fix the significant flaws in the nuclear deal to counter Iranian aggression. He believes very strongly in supporting the Iranian people. We believe that our shared values and commitment to confront sort of the common security challenges will transcend any disagreements over the JCPOA. And we weren\u2019t able to bridge all the gaps between our respective views on the JCPOA. We think that we\u2019ve been able to make a lot of progress on the range of issues on the nuclear and security sort of objectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture, a new framework, and I think that, again, people, I think, are overstating the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Brian, thanks. Lesley Wroughton from Reuters is next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, hi, Brian. I kind of want to come back to what the others are trying to say, because at a time when \u2013 a sensitive time when you\u2019re actually trying to get Iran to be part of discussions, it seems that you\u2019re pushing them away. How does one convince them through this new architecture that it\u2019s to their benefit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Well, you\u2019ve seen the protests in Iran, and you\u2019ve seen their dissatisfaction with \u2013 I think the Iranian people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime which have not helped the Iranian people. The President has spoken very eloquently about the concerns of the Iranian people. And so we \u2013 the President has said \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if it was the President said it or \u2013 but we have said that we are ready to negotiate a better deal, and there are a range of nations that can be a part of that. We certainly have the folks within the JCPOA, but we think there are other countries that also share these concerns, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, last question is Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. Hey, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Brian, do you have a timeframe for how long the U.S. would like this next round of negotiations to occur? At what point would the U.S. just say this is not going to happen? And can you also draw a parallel to North Korea? One of the things the administration has said about why North Korea came to the table was this maximum pressure campaign that left it so isolated diplomatically and economically. Do you believe that you could obtain the same scenario with Iran, that you would be able to create a similarly sort of airtight sanctions regime again with them?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK: </b>With the \u2013 by reimposing the sanctions that were lifted under the JCPOA, that will bring economic pressure to bear on Iran. It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago. We very much want a diplomatic outcome, one that is going to increase the security of the American people. We thought that the JCPOA provided too much in return for too little, and we also thought that it had very strong deficiencies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are going to be very focused on trying to achieve the President\u2019s national security objectives, and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions is part of our diplomatic strategy to try to achieve a better security architecture. And so the goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be discussing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe very much want to be \u2013 have a very kind of up-tempo diplomacy, one that\u2019s very focused and very determined to achieve our national security objectives. And Secretary Pompeo is committed to spending as much time as necessary with his team to achieve our goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, everyone, we have to wrap it up. Brian, thank you so much for your time. Everyone, thanks for calling in. We look forward to having as many of you join us for the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday. I believe we\u2019ll be sending out a formal announcement if we haven\u2019t already. So we look forward to talking with you. The embargo has now been lifted. And have a great weekend, everyone. Brian, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

(Applause.) Welcome to the Heritage Foundation. My name is Kay James and I have the honor of being the president here. It is a pleasure and honor to welcome our distinguished guest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, back to Heritage. Yes, I said back. Some of you may remember that then-Congressman Pompeo spoke here on September 9th, 2015. His presence was appreciated, as his topic was timely. It was entitled \u201cA Pathway Forward: An Alternative to the Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal.\u201d And now we have the great pleasure of being with our friend in his new role as Secretary of State for the United States of America. It\u2019s not just a pleasure having him here; it\u2019s truly an honor that he chose Heritage as the site for his first public address as Secretary.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOur scholars here are dedicated to advancing individual freedom and national security, and his presence here is a wonderful affirmation of the positive impact that their work is having. And so to Secretary Pompeo, I\u2019d like to say thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, I imagine all who are in this room and watching online know a great deal about Secretary Pompeo, but please allow me to provide just a few highlights from his extraordinary career. Secretary Pompeo graduated first in his class at the United States military academy at West Point, and then served as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He also served with the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the U.S. Army\u2019s 4th Infantry Division. After leaving active duty, he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then had a successful private sector career, founding and serving as CEO of Thayer Aerospace and then becoming president of Sentry International.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo\u2019s public service began when he was elected representative of Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District, and his distinguished tenure on the Hill included service on the House Intelligence Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Select Benghazi Committee. Recognizing the Secretary\u2019s many talents, President Trump tapped him as director of the CIA, where he served from January 2017 to April 2018. And now, of course, he is our Secretary of State, having been sworn in just three and a half weeks ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast but, of course, never least, Secretary Pompeo is married to Susan Pompeo and has one son, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo, on behalf of the board of trustees, the staff, and all of the friends of the Heritage Foundation, welcome back to home. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the Heritage Foundation and its president, Kay Coles James. Thank you for hosting me today. First as a private citizen and then as a member of Congress, and even today, the Heritage Foundation has shaped my thinking on matters of the world and public policy issues. I\u2019m grateful for that excellent work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thanks for reminding me I can\u2019t talk about anything else but what we\u2019re talking about today. (Laughter.) Three years on. But it\u2019s an honor to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTwo weeks ago, President Trump terminated the United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump withdrew from the deal for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risk created by the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNo more. No more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats. No more acceptance of missiles landing in Riyadh and in the Golan Heights. No more cost-free expansions of Iranian power. No more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA put the world at risk because of its fatal flaws.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd they\u2019re worth recounting at some length today, if only for the purpose of ensuring that subsequent arrangements do not repeat them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, the weak sunset provisions of the JCPOA merely delayed the inevitable nuclear weapons capability of the Iranian regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfter the countdown clock ran out on the deal\u2019s sunset provisions, Iran would be free for a quick sprint to the bomb, setting off a potentially catastrophic arms race in the region. Indeed, the very brevity of the delay in the Iranian nuclear program itself incentivized Middle Eastern proliferation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMoreover, as we have seen from Israel\u2019s recent remarkable intelligence operation, Iran has lied for years about having had a nuclear weapons program. Iran entered into the JCPOA in bad faith. It is worth noting that even today, the regime continues to lie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told a Sunday morning news show, \u201cWe never wanted to produce a bomb.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis claim \u2013 this claim would be laughable if not for the willful deception behind it. Not only did the AMAD Program exist; the Iranians took great care \u2013 though, as we can see now, not enough care \u2013 to protect, hide, and preserve the work of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Mahabadi and his gang of nuclear scientists.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA had additional shortcomings as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal were simply not strong enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe deal did nothing to address Iran\u2019s continuing development of ballistic and cruise missiles, which could deliver nuclear warheads.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA permitted the Iranian regime to use the money from the JCPOA to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people, but the regime\u2019s leaders refused to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tInstead, the government spent its newfound treasure fueling proxy wars across the Middle East and lining the pockets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizballah, Hamas, and the Houthis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRemember: Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during the JCPOA. Qasem Soleimani has been playing with house money that has become blood money. Wealth created by the West has fueled his campaigns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrategically, the Obama administration made a bet that the deal would spur Iran to stop its rogue state actions and conform to international norms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat bet was a loser with massive repercussions for all of the people living in the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe idea of the JCPOA as a strategic pillar of stability in the Middle East was captured perfectly by John Kerry when he said, quote, \u201cI know the Middle East that is on fire \u2026 is going to be more manageable with this deal,\u201d end of quote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tQuery whether the Middle East is more manageable today than it was when they embarked on the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLebanon is an even more comfortable home for Hizballah today than it was when we embarked on the JCPOA. Hizballah is now armed to the teeth by Iran and has its sights set on Israel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to Iran, Hizballah provides the ground forces for the military expedition in Syria. The IRGC, too, has continued to pump thousands of fighters into Syria to prop up the murderous Assad regime and help make that country 71,000 square miles of kill zone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran perpetuates a conflict that has displaced more than 6 million Syrians inside the \u2013 6 million Syrians and caused over 5 million to seek refuge outside of its borders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese refugees include foreign fighters who have crossed into Europe and threatened terrorist attacks in those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, Iran sponsored Shia militia groups and terrorists to infiltrate and undermine the Iraqi Security Forces and jeopardize Iraq\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 all of this during the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Yemen, Iran\u2019s support for the Houthi militia fuels a conflict that continues to starve the Yemeni people and hold them under the threat of terror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe IRGC has also given Houthi missiles to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and to threaten international shipping in the Red Sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s support to the Taliban in the form of weapons and funding leads to further violence and hinders peace and stability for the Afghan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the Iranian Qods Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe should remember, too, that during the JCPOA Iran continues to hold Americans hostage: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and Bob Levinson, who has been missing for over 11 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI will note for the American people, you should know we are working diligently to bring each American missing wrongfully detained in Iran home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe list continues. Iran continues to be, during the JCPOA, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror. It continues to serve as sanctuary for al-Qaida, as it has done since 9/11, and remains unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members residing in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hizballah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaida? The United States believe you deserve better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have an additional point for the Iranian people to ponder. Here in the West, President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif are often held apart from the regime\u2019s unwise terrorist and malign behavior. They are treated somehow differently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe West says, \u201cBoy, if only they could control Ayatollah Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani then things would be great.\u201d Yet, Rouhani and Zarif are your elected leaders. Are they not the most responsible for your economic struggles? Are these two not responsible for wasting Iranian lives throughout the Middle East?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s worth the Iranian people considering, because instead of helping their own citizens, the regime continues to seek a corridor stretching from Iran\u2019s borders to the shores of the Mediterranean. Iran wants this corridor to transport fighters and an advanced weapons system to Israel\u2019s doorsteps. Indeed in recent months, the IRGC has flown an armed drone into Israeli airspace and launched salvos of rockets into the Golan Heights from Syria. Our steadfast ally has asserted the sovereign right of self-defense in response, a stance the United States will continue to unequivocally support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the bet \u2013 the bet that the JCPOA would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East, and indeed for the entire world. It is clear that the JCPOA has not ended Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, nor did it deter its quest for a regional hegemony. Iran\u2019s leaders saw the deal as the starting gun for the march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, the path forward. America\u2019s commitment to the Iran strategy President Trump laid down in October remains. It will now be executed outside of the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll continue to work with allies to counter the regime\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran\u2019s proliferation of missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten peace and stability. We will also ensure Iran has no path to a nuclear weapon \u2013 not now, not ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFollowing our withdrawal from the JCPOA, President Trump has asked me to achieve these goals on Iran. We\u2019ll pursue those goals along several lines of effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, we will apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime. The leaders in Tehran will have no doubt about our seriousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to our colleagues at the Department of Treasury, sanctions are going back in full effect and new ones are coming. Last week we imposed sanctions on the head of Iran\u2019s central bank and other entities that were funneling money to the IRGC Qods Force. They were also providing money to Hizballah and other terrorist organizations. The Iranian regime should know that this is just the beginning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis sting of sanctions will be painful if the regime does not change its course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen to one that rejoins the league of nations. These will indeed end up being the strongest sanctions in history when we are complete.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come in force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran will be forced to make a choice: either fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It will not have the resources to do both.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, I will work closely with the Department of Defense and our regional allies to deter Iranian aggression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe will ensure freedom of navigation on the waters in the region. We will work to prevent and counteract any Iranian malign cyber activity. We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hizballah proxies operating around the world and we will crush them. Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019d remind the leadership in Iran what President Trump said: If they restart their nuclear program, it will mean bigger problems \u2013 bigger problems than they\u2019d ever had before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, we will also advocate tirelessly for the Iranian people. The regime must improve how it treats its citizens. It must protect the human rights of every Iranian. It must cease wasting Iran\u2019s wealth abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe ask that our international partners continue to add their voice to ours in condemning Iran\u2019s treatment of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe protests \u2013 the protests of the past few months show that the Iranian people are deeply frustrated with their own government\u2019s failures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian economy is struggling as a result of bad Iranian decisions. Workers aren\u2019t getting paid, strikes are a daily occurrence, and the rial is plummeting. Youth unemployment is at a staggering 25 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGovernment mismanagement of Iran\u2019s natural resources has led to severe droughts and other environmental crises as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLook, these problems are compounded by enormous corruption inside of Iran, and the Iranian people can smell it. The protests last winter showed that many are angry at the regime that keeps for itself what the regime steals from its people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Iranians too are angry at a regime elite that commits hundreds of millions of dollars to military operations and terrorist groups abroad while the Iranian people cry out for a simple life with jobs and opportunity and with liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime\u2019s response to the protests has only exposed the country\u2019s leadership is running scared. Thousands have been jailed arbitrarily, and at least dozens have been killed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs seen from the hijab protests, the brutal men of the regime seem to be particularly terrified by Iranian women who are demanding their rights. As human beings with inherent dignity and inalienable rights, the women of Iran deserve the same freedoms that the men of Iran possess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut this is all on top of a well-documented terror and torture that the regime has inflicted for decades on those who dissent from the regime\u2019s ideology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime is going to ultimately have to look itself in the mirror. The Iranian people, especially its youth, are increasingly eager for economic, political, and social change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands with those longing for a country of economic opportunity, government transparency, fairness, and greater liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe hope, indeed we expect, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses and support \u2013 not suppress \u2013 the aspirations of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re open to new steps with not only our allies and partners, but with Iran as well. But only if Iran is willing to make major changes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs President Trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing, and able to negotiate a new deal. But the deal is not the objective. Our goal is to protect the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAny new agreement will make sure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and will deter the regime\u2019s malign behavior in a way that the JCPOA never could. We will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations, and we will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself. The Iranian wave of destruction in the region in just the last few years is proof that Iran\u2019s nuclear aspirations cannot be separated from the overall security picture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what should it be? We must begin to define what it is that we demand from Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, Iran must declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iran must also provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, each of them detained on spurious charges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must also end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring senior al-Qaida leaders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end the IRG Qods Force\u2019s support for terrorists and militant partners around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd too, Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors \u2013 many of whom are U.S. allies. This certainly includes its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also includes threats to international shipping and destructive \u2013 and destructive cyberattacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat list is pretty long, but if you take a look at it, these are 12 very basic requirements. The length of the list is simply a scope of the malign behavior of Iran. We didn\u2019t create the list, they did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom my conversations with European friends, I know that they broadly share these same views of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community. I ask that America\u2019s allies join us in calling for the Iranian Government to act more responsibly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn exchange for major changes in Iran, the United States is prepared to take actions which will benefit the Iranian people. These areas of action include a number of things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, once this is achieved, we\u2019re prepared to end the principal components of every one of our sanctions against the regime. We\u2019re happy at that point to re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relationships with Iran. And we\u2019re prepared to admit<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_edn1\" href=\"#_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Iran to have advanced technology. If Iran makes this fundamental strategic shift, we, too, are prepared to support the modernization and reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international economic system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut relief from our efforts will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran\u2019s policies. We acknowledge Iran\u2019s right to defend its people. But not its actions which jeopardize world\u2019s citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in contrast to the previous administration, we want to include Congress as a partner in this process. We want our efforts to have broad support with the American people and endure beyond the Trump Administration. A treaty would be our preferred way to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUnlike the JCPOA, which was broadly rejected across both sides of the aisle, an agreement that President Trump proposes would surely garner this type of widespread support from our elected leaders and the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the strategy we laid out today, we want the support of our most important allies and partners in the region and around the globe. Certainly our European friends, but much more than that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want the Australians, the Bahrainis, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Japanese, the Jordanians, the Kuwaitis, the Omanis, the Qataris, the Saudi Arabians, South Korea, the UAE, and many, many others worldwide to join in this effort against the Islamic Republic of Iran. I know that those countries share the same goals. They understand the challenge the same way that America does. Indeed, we welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation, and the brutality of a regime which is at odds with world peace, a country that continues to inflict chaos on innocent people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIndeed, while to some the changes in Iranian behavior we seek may seem unrealistic, we should recall that what we are pursuing was the global consensus before the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, in 2012, President Obama said, quote, \u201cThe deal we\u2019ll accept is [that] they end their nuclear program,\u201d end of quote. That didn\u2019t happen. In 2006, the P5 voted at the Security Council for Iran to immediately suspend all enrichment activities. That didn\u2019t happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2013, the French foreign minister said he was wary of being sucked into a, quote, \u201ccon game,\u201d end of quote, over allowing Iran to continue uranium enrichment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2015, John Kerry said, quote, \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize the right to enrich,\u201d end of quote. Yet the Iranians are enriching even as we sit here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re not asking anything other than that Iranian behavior be consistent with global norms, global norms widely recognized before the JCPOA. And we want to eliminate their capacity to threaten our world with those nuclear activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to its nuclear activities, why would we allow Iran more capability than we have permitted the United Arab Emirates and that we\u2019re asking for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? We understand that our reimposition of sanctions and the coming pressure campaign on the Iranian regime will pose financial and economic difficulties for a number of our friends. Indeed, it imposes economic challenges to America as well. These are markets our businesses would love to sell into as well. And we want to hear their concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account. Over the coming weeks, we will send teams of specialists to countries around the world to further explain administration policy, to discuss the implications of sanctions we imposition, and to listen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI know. I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time with our allies in my first three weeks. I know that they may decide to try and keep their old nuclear deal going with Tehran. That is certainly their decision to make. They know where we stand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNext year marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic \u2013 Revolution in Iran. At this milestone, we have to ask: What has the Iranian Revolution given to the Iranian people? The regime reaps a harvest of suffering and death in the Middle East at the expense of its own citizens. Iran\u2019s economy is stagnant and without direction and about to get worse. Its young people are withering under the weight of frustrated ambitions. They are longing to pursue the freedoms and opportunities of the 21st century.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran\u2019s leaders can change all of this if they choose to do so. Ali Khamenei has been supreme leader since 1989. He will not live forever, nor will the Iranian people abide the rigid rules of tyrants forever. For two generations, the Iranian regime has exacted a heavy toll on its own people and the world. The hard grip of repression is all that millions of Iranians have ever known.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow is the time for the supreme leader and the Iranian regime to summon the courage to do something historically beneficial for its own people, for this ancient and proud nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs for the United States, our eyes are clear as to the nature of this regime, but our ears are open to what may be possible. Unlike the previous administration, we are looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people, not just the regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf anyone, especially the leaders of Iran, doubts the President\u2019s sincerity or his vision, let them look at our diplomacy with North Korea. Our willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un underscores the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to diplomacy to help solve the greatest challenges, even with our staunchest adversaries. But that willingness, that willingness has been accompanied by a painful pressure campaign that reflects our commitment to resolve this challenge forever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo the ayatollah, to President Rouhani, and to other Iranian leaders: understand that your current activities will be met with steely resolve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy final message today is, in fact, to the Iranian people. I want to repeat President Trump\u2019s words from October. President Trump said that, \u201cWe stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime\u2019s longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. The Iranian people long to reclaim their country\u2019s proud history, its culture, its civilization, and its cooperation with its neighbors.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is America\u2019s hope that our labors toward peace and security will bear fruit for the long-suffering people of Iran. We long to see them prosper and flourish as in past decades and, indeed, as never before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the United States of America is proud to take a new course towards that objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES: </strong>Thank you so very much. Bold, concise, unambiguous. We appreciate you taking this forum here at the Heritage Foundation to deliver that message. Looking at \u2013 and you listed during your speech several of our allies and friends and partners, many of whom are angry, some disappointed. How are you going to bring them on board? How are you going to use your best diplomatic skills to bring them along with us?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> These strategic changes in the world come together when countries decide on an objective that is shared, and that always begins with a shared interest and values. I spent the first couple of weeks of my time as Secretary of State working to try to see if there wasn\u2019t a way to fix the deal. I spoke with my European counterparts. I traveled there. In my 13th hour as Secretary of State I was on the ground in Brussels speaking with my European counterparts. We couldn\u2019t get it done. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States intends to work hard at the diplomatic piece of working alongside all of our partners. We focus on the Europeans, but there are scores of countries around the world who share our concerns and are equally threatened by the Iranian regime. It\u2019s that shared interest, it\u2019s the value set which will ultimately drive, I believe, a global response to this \u2013 to the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror. I\u2019m convinced it can take place. My team is going to work diligently to do that. We\u2019re going to do so in the context of trying to address the concerns of all of our partners, and I am convinced that over a period of time there will be a broad recognition that the strategy that President Trump has laid out is the right one that will put Iran in a place where it will one day rejoin civilization in the way that we all hope that it will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> It\u2019s clear through your comments this morning that you truly want tough sanctions. And I think that there is some remaining concern about how are you going to deal with the nuclear concerns. Can you speak to that for just a bit? And let me say to our audience, by the way, that I wish we had more time with the Secretary this morning, and there will be an abrupt and a hard stop because we have to get him out to the CIA and \u2013 for the swearing-in ceremony, and we don\u2019t want you late for that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo talk to us about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I got to go back one more time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> One more time. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, the nuclear file is imperative. It presents the largest, most severe threat for sure. The JCPOA fell short. It was a delay. Our aim is to get that permanently fixed. I mentioned quickly, right, we ask our other Middle Eastern partners to do hard things. We put a 123 agreement in front of them and say, \u201cThis is what you have to do.\u201d And they say, \u201cHey, the Iranians enrich.\u201d That\u2019s reasonable. That seems to me a reasonable point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell, our demands on Iran aren\u2019t unreasonable. Give up your program. End it. Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we\u2019re fully prepared to respond to that as well. I\u2019m certainly not going to share with you today precisely what our response will be. But we watch them talk. We\u2019ve heard them say \u2013 I hope that they\u2019ll make a different decision, that they\u2019ll choose a different path. We welcome them taking a path that other nations in the region are beginning to take as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, can you explain for us the sanctions structure and how you intend to target the Iranian regime without hurting our European friends?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, any time sanctions are put in place, countries have to give up economic activity. So the Americans have given up economic activity now for an awfully long time, and I\u2019ll concede there are American companies who would love to do business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. There\u2019s a huge market there. It\u2019s a big, vibrant, wonderful peoples. But everyone is going to have to participate in this. Every country is going to have to understand that we cannot continue to create wealth for Qasem Soleimani.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRight, that\u2019s what this is. At the end of the day, this money has flowed to him. The economics have permitted them to run roughshod across the Middle East. Our effort is to strangle his economic capacity to do harm to the Middle East and to the world. Nuclear programs aren\u2019t cheap. To the extent we are effective at making it more difficult on the Iranian regime, we will reduce their capacity to continue to build out their nuclear weapon system as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> You\u2019ve laid out a very, very bold plan this morning. Do you have a timeframe for getting all this done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the sanctions are back in place and are winding down over the next 100 and what, 55 days? There are \u2013 there\u2019s lots more work in place. It is a effort across all of government. We are working certainly diplomatically in the lead, but Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, each of us has the same mission from President Trump. I can\u2019t put a timeline on it. But at the end of the day, the Iranian people will decide the timeline. At the end of the day, the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly, that would be wonderful. If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forward today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, Mr. Secretary, again, on behalf of the Heritage Foundation and the scholars here who have been working on these issues for a very long time, we want to thank you. Again, it was a bold vision \u2013 clear, concise, unambiguous \u2013 and we want to congratulate you and the President, and we wish you Godspeed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI am going to ask you to remain seated while the Secretary exits. I have about eight more questions here, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you all very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Thank you so much. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "official_title": "Secretary of State",
        "date": "May 24, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for doing this interview with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> It\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> As Secretary of State, you chose Iran as your first major foreign policy speech. Why Iran? Is it because of the urgency or the importance of it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I think it\u2019s both. It\u2019s something that the President has viewed as a serious threat to Middle East stability and therefore to American national security and also looks at the place that the Iranian people find themselves, and he thinks it\u2019s a place America can help make a difference. He has long thought that the agreement that the previous administration entered into didn\u2019t serve any of those interests \u2013 the interests of the Iranian people or Middle East stability or, frankly, for America. And so it was a priority for him and thus I wanted in the first weeks since the Secretary of State to have an opportunity to lay out how President Trump thinks we can make things better in each of those three situations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What is the ultimate goal of the proposed new security framework, and how is it differ \u2013 how does it differ from the initial JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so very different. Different in breadth and I think different in its goal. The first agreement was very narrow. It was an effort to say that the Iranian regime was spending a ton of money on its nuclear program and it wanted to halt that \u2013 a noble objective, a good goal, a worthy one. But the threat that Iran presents is so much greater than that, right. They\u2019re taking \u2013 they\u2019re launching missiles into Muslim countries. They\u2019re taking the human rights away from their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these things I think President Trump cares deeply about, and so his vision is that if we begin again to set out what we think are pretty basic ideas, right. So these 12 things that I listed are all pretty straightforward. We\u2019re not asking a lot from the Iranian leadership, just behave like normal leaders; don\u2019t loot your people, don\u2019t waste your people\u2019s money on these adventures in Syria and Yemen and in Lebanon and in Iraq, the list goes on; lead your people, build a great nation, use the resources you have for that. That\u2019s all we\u2019re simply looking for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that going to be part of the new proposed security framework that Iran would stop or should stop meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so we\u2019ve asked for that. Look, we\u2019ve asked them to stop spreading terror around the world, not to build out militias in Iraq, not to put Iranian dollars and Iranian citizens, who are losing their lives in Syria \u2013 it\u2019s inappropriate for Middle East security and it\u2019s bad for the country. So our aim is to set conditions where Iran will behave like a normal nation, right. And if they do that, if they \u2013 and this is not the Iranian people. This is the Iranian leaders who have taken control and done this damage. If we can create conditions where they\u2019ll stop that, the Iranian people will have great success, and we will have Americans visiting there, and we\u2019ll have all the great things that we do when there are friends and allies as opposed to folks who are presenting risk to our country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I\u2019m going to get to the human rights issue also, sir. But if I may, I want to continue on the security framework if possible. How about a requirement for Iran to let inspections in the military sites? Is that going to be part of also the framework?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> So it is. With respect to the use of nuclear material in Iran, just as we have in Saudi Arabia, just as we did with the United Arab Emirates, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for Iran to have the capacity to create fissile material, to enrich uranium or have a plutonium facility. If they want a peaceful nuclear energy program, fine, but they could import that material. And other countries do it; it works for many countries around the world. And in order for us to achieve that, to get comfortable that that\u2019s the case, there will have to be inspections. That would include inspections at military sites and research laboratories and all the places that had been participants in previous iterations of Iran\u2019s program.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you mentioned human rights. There are protests, anti-government protests, all around Iran. I wanted to get your take on that. What do you \u2013 how do you feel about these protests? And do you think that United States can maybe support the protestors?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We can certainly provide moral support. I think importantly, the Iranian people will make these decisions for themselves. These protests have been ongoing now for months and months \u2013 some of them very small, some of them larger \u2013 often very much in sync with what I laid out this past week, their \u2013 how this wealth gets distributed to Qasem Soleimani and not the ordinary citizen in southeast Iran or in Tehran or wherever it might be. This wealth is being squandered so that ordinary Iranian citizens are both sending their young men off to fight and die and living lives that aren\u2019t as secure and as wealthy as they could be if Iran would simply change its behavior.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not about \u2013 you asked about regime change. It\u2019s not about changing the regime. It\u2019s about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people really want them to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it is what earlier John Bolton had said, that the goal of the administration is not regime change in Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> That\u2019s correct. Yes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And how do you feel about the opposition groups in the United States and in Europe? Do you support their efforts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yes. They should be \u2013 so long as they\u2019re working towards the same goal that we are. I\u2019ve seen from time to time that wasn\u2019t always the case with some of the groups, some of the smaller groups, frankly. So long as they\u2019re working towards the same thing. We don\u2019t want them advocating for regime change either. We want them working on behalf of the Iranian people, ordinary Iranian citizens who want nothing more than to live their lives, to be able to take their hijab off, to be able to go to work and raise their families and worship in the way they want to worship. This is for the Iranian people to do, and so if there are those on the outside who are working towards that goal, we certainly welcome it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, two years ago as a congressman you personally wanted to go to Iran, you were prepared to go to Iran, and you wanted to press the leadership \u2013 Khamenei and Zarif \u2013 to give you access to the American hostages. As Secretary, are you going to press the Iranian leadership again to free the American hostages? And as you know, Bob Levinson has disappeared more than 11 years ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I know the story of Mr. Levinson well. I pray for his safe return, and our team works for it every day. As for the other Americans, we hope that the Iranian leadership \u2013 Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, Ayatollah \u2013 all would see that it\u2019s in their best interests to \u2013 and for nothing more than basic humanity, to allow these innocent Americans to return to their families. There are big, big issues out there, but it seems pretty basic to me that one ought not hold innocent people from returning to their loved ones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo yes, we\u2019ll work on it. We\u2019ll pray for it. And we hope that one day, in the same way that we were blessed to have three Americans return from North Korea a few weeks past, we have that same kind of day for those that are being held by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I wanted to ask you about the chants, the slogans that we still hear inside Iran: \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d Before any type of agreement that Iran or Tehran and the United States would have about Iran, don\u2019t you think that it should be a requirement for Iran to stop that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, their leaders most especially. In America, people say all kinds of things. We have a wide-open democracy. There are people who like President Trump and who don\u2019t. I find that just fine. I am untroubled by that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen you have senior leaders, when you have others fomenting these sort of fake gatherings to do nothing but come after and talk \u2013 chant, \u201cDeath to America\u201d or \u201cDeath to Israel,\u201d the Iranian leadership ought to stop. They ought to stop that because it\u2019s not the right thing for their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think most Iranians \u2013 I think most Iranians look at what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish here in America and how blessed we\u2019ve been, and think that that\u2019s a model that works in the sense of we\u2019ll certainly adopt a different form of democracy, and we\u2019ll have a different form of government, and we\u2019ll have different values and beliefs across a certain set of things, we\u2019ll have different religions, and that \u2013 that\u2019s all fine. But the basic common understanding of humanity, that you treat every human being with dignity and respect, that you don\u2019t export violence around the world, that you don\u2019t steal and plunder from your people, those core values that are civilizational, they\u2019re historical \u2013 I think the Iranian people share those in the same way that the American people do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, I want to go back to something that you said, part of your speech. You stressed that \u2013 stressed, and you just mentioned it, that \u201cno more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats.\u201d What is your take on congressional efforts to expose the hidden wealth of the corrupt leaders of Iran, from Ayatollah Khamenei to the president? And if there is such a bill that would pass Congress, would the administration support this exposure?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We would. We think it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s just as important as an informational matter. The Iranian people deserve the truth. You have senior leaders that are pocketing money, using businesses that are nominally fronts, and frankly, just stealing. To the extent we can prove that and demonstrate that, I\u2019d welcome the chance to expose it so the Iranian people can judge for themselves whether these are the individuals they want to lead their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Thank you very much, ma\u2019am. It was great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We appreciate it very, very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\tAt the 37<sup>th</sup> Human Rights Council session in Geneva, February 26-March 23, the U.S. addressed urgent human rights situations around the world. This session brought attention to human rights issues in Iran, Syria, North Korea, Burma, Cambodia and South Sudan, among others. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee delivered our national statement on February 28, underscoring the U.S. commitment to human rights, as well as our continued concerns about the Council\u2019s disproportionate focus on Israel and our commitment to reforming the Council. The United States introduced a resolution on South Sudan that the Council adopted with broad cross-regional support. Our active engagement on all other Council actions allowed the U.S. to protect critical legal and policy equities and achieve successful outcomes. In addition, through national and joint statements, the United States addressed human rights situations in China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, the DRC, Egypt, Turkey, Burundi, Azerbaijan, the Maldives, Vietnam, and Bahrain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Supporting Israel:</b> The United States worked closely with Israel and other partners to combat the institutionalized bias against Israel both by opposing Agenda Item 7, the only Council agenda item focused on a single country, and by voting against every resolution introduced under Item 7. Australia joined in voting against all Item 7 resolutions, while many other partners changed votes to either vote no or abstain. This session demonstrated the largest shift in votes towards more abstentions and no votes on Israel related resolutions since the creation of the HRC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Standing up for the Integrity of UN Human Rights Mechanisms:</b> The United States voted against a China-led resolution on <b>mutually beneficial cooperation</b>, which sought to weaken international human rights frameworks by demanding that governments be \u201crespected\u201d (i.e. not have their human rights records criticized) and suggesting that governments could agree on \u201cwin-win\u201d exceptions to human rights concerns. In a strong explanation of vote, the United States underscored that \u201cfeel good\u201d language about mutually beneficial cooperation is intended to benefit autocratic states at the expense of individuals whose human rights and fundamental freedoms we should all respect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Iran</b>: The United States played a key role in garnering support for the resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The United States also read, on behalf of a group of 27 countries, a joint statement addressing the recent crackdown in Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>North Korea:</b> The United States supported a resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, condemned the ongoing systematic and widespread human rights violations and abuses, called for accountability, and voiced ongoing support for monitoring and documentation efforts by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Syria: </b>The United States supported an urgent debate on the dire situation in eastern Ghouta, which culminated in a resolution condemning the violations of the ceasefire. The United States also co-sponsored the resolution renewing the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which condemned the violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law throughout Syria, primarily by the Assad regime, including the use of chemical weapons, abuse of detainees, and denial of humanitarian aid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>South Sudan:</b> The United States led a resolution to renew the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for another year to collect and preserve evidence that can be used in future judicial efforts, including the AU Hybrid Court for South Sudan. We worked closely with South Sudan, members of the African Group, and other member states to ensure the text was adopted by consensus. South Sudan\u2019s support for the resolution reaffirmed its commitment to continue cooperating with the Commission and UN bodies and mechanisms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Burma: </b>The United States co-sponsored an EU-led resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and support the work of other special procedures, including the Fact Finding Mission, which are invaluable in investigating and highlighting the human rights situation in Burma. The resolution was adopted following a vote called by China.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Cambodia</b>: The United States joined 44 other countries in supporting New Zealand\u2019s joint statement highlighting the decline in civil and political rights in Cambodia in the run up to national elections scheduled for July 29. The joint statement noted that an electoral process from which the main democratic opposition party is arbitrarily excluded cannot be considered genuine or legitimate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Other Country Situations:</b> The United States co-sponsored priority resolutions that renewed mandates on <b>Burma</b> and <b>North Korea</b>, as well as a resolution drawing attention to the human rights situations in <b>Georgia</b>, including the Russian-occupied territories of Georgia. We supported cooperative resolutions on <b>Libya</b> and <b>Mali.</b> The United States also delivered a statement supporting the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 engagement in <b>Yemen</b>, <b>Georgia</b>, <b>Afghanistan</b>, and <b>Haiti</b>. Additionally, the United States joined joint statements highlighting serious concerns regarding the human rights situations in <b>Cambodia</b>, <b>Maldives</b>, and <b>Sri Lanka</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Development Resolutions: </b>The United States worked actively to remove trade-related language from resolutions on development, and to ensure that all resolutions that touch on development make clear that states may not use their lack of development or related concerns to excuse a failure to uphold their human rights obligations or commitments. We re-stated our long-standing opposition to recognizing a \u201cright to development.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Thematic Issues:</b> The United States co-sponsored resolutions on <b>freedom of religion or belief</b>, <b>good governance</b>, the prevention of <b>genocide</b>, the rights of <b>minorities</b> and of persons with <b>disabilities</b>, and the impact of corruption on <b>torture</b>, among others. The United States also opposed a cynical Russia-led resolution on \u201cintegrity of the judicial system,\u201d which failed to address issues of judicial independence, and inaccurately reflected aspects of international law.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

On numerous resolutions and actions covering both country-specific and thematic topics, U.S. engagement protected critical equities of the United States, provided clarity on country-specific situations, and achieved successful outcomes on difficult issues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Yemen: </strong>The United States successfully brokered a significant consensus resolution to address the human rights situation in Yemen. The resolution creates a Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts -- the strongest mechanism to examine and report on the human rights situation in Yemen to date. The resolution also continues technical assistance and capacity building to the Republic of Yemen Government\u2019s National Commission of Inquiry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Venezuela:</strong> On September 11, High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein asserted that crimes against humanity may have been committed in Venezuela. In an address to the Council later that day, Venezuela\u2019s Foreign Minister attempted to shift attention away from the Maduro regime\u2019s continuing human rights violations. The United States denounced the address and echoed the Lima Group\u2019s September 12,\u00a0joint statement condemning the continued breakdown of democratic order and violations of human rights in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Burundi:</strong> The United States co-sponsored a resolution presented by the EU renewing the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Human Rights in Burundi, which passed by a vote of 22 to 11 with 14 abstentions. The United States voted against Burundi\u2019s competing, self-drafted resolution because it painted an incorrect picture of the human rights situation and did not renew the COI. Instead, the latter resolution sponsored by the African Group, which passed 23 to 14 with 9 abstentions, merely requested that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) appoint an expert to strengthen the work of the OHCHR office in Burundi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC):</strong> The United States voted against the DRC\u2019s self-drafted resolution, which passed despite inappropriately laudatory language describing DRC efforts to hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations and abuses, and weak calls for the DRC to respect its human rights obligations and commitments. The United States delivered a strong statement supporting the continued work of the Group of Experts operating in Kasais region and calling upon the government to fully cooperate with it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Sudan:</strong> The United States co-sponsored a resolution presented by the African Group renewing the mandate of the Independent Expert on Sudan for another year, which passed by consensus. While recognizing some positive developments in Sudan over the past year, the resolution also highlights serious remaining concerns. It also encourages Sudan to intensify its endeavors to address humanitarian needs in conflict-affected areas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Other Country Situations: </strong>The United States co-sponsored a resolution on the violations and abuses of human rights in <strong>Syria</strong>, particularly on the impact of the civil war on children. The United States supported renewing the mandates of the Independent Experts on <strong>Somalia</strong> and <strong>Central African Republic</strong> and extending the mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission for <strong>Burma</strong> for another year. The United States signed joint statements on the human rights situations in <strong>Crimea</strong> and the <strong>Philippines</strong>. We joined consensus on a resolution renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on <strong>Cambodia</strong> for another two years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>Thematic Resolutions:</strong> The United States co-sponsored a resolution to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteurs on <strong>truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence</strong>. The United States joined consensus on resolutions addressing reprisals against those who would cooperate with the UN, the human rights of <strong>indigenous persons, women, and the Sustainable Development Goals</strong> (SDGs) and renewing the mandate of the Working Group on <strong>enforced and involuntary disappearances</strong>.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you very much for joining us, and thanks to our colleagues in New York. My name is Benjamin Weber. I\u2019m the director of the Foreign Press Centers, and I\u2019m very pleased to welcome our senior official for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Ambassador Michael Kozak, who is going to present this year\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights. I\u2019ll allow him to take a few moments to make some opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll go to questions and answers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay. Thank you very much. I thought I might spend a few minutes going through why we do the reports, what they represent, what they\u2019re used for, and then we can open it up for questions and comments by all of you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 this is the 42nd year that we\u2019ve done the Annual Human Rights Reports, and they\u2019re done as a requirement of U.S. law. This goes back to the 1970s, when Congress said to the Executive Branch, \u201cWhen we\u2019re making decisions about foreign assistance and security assistance and trade agreements and all of that, we\u2019d really like to know: What is the human rights situation in the countries that we\u2019re dealing with?\u201d So they charged the President by law \u2013 or the Secretary of State \u2013 with having to produce this annual report to them that is supposed to report on the situation of human rights in each of the member-nations of the United Nations and a few other territories or areas that we deal with as well. We try to do that \u2013 and it\u2019s internationally recognized human rights, and then there are a few requirements that are added on from the U.S. law specifically.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the reason we do the reports is not to be passing judgment on other countries, or the old word of name and shame; it\u2019s not with that in mind. It\u2019s to fulfill a statutory responsibility to our Congress to try to produce the most accurate description of what we find is going on in other countries so that they can use that in making decisions. And frankly, it gets used then also by our judicial system. For example, when our immigration officers or our immigration judges are assessing asylum claims or refugee claims, they\u2019re matching the person\u2019s story against what they know of country conditions, and they use these reports as a factual baseline for that. We use it in the Executive Branch as well when we\u2019re meeting with foreign officials. It\u2019s the basis on which we can brief the President or the Secretary of State on the human rights situation in that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the whole effort is to make it as factual, as clinical as possible, and not \u2013 we\u2019re not drawing conclusions. We\u2019re reporting what\u2019s out there, and often you\u2019re getting contradictory information. You\u2019ll have a credible source \u2013 media in another country, a respectable newspaper, or a nongovernment organization or something \u2013 saying, \u201cThis happened,\u201d and then you have somebody else saying, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d or, \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen that way.\u201d And we try to reflect both of those things. We don\u2019t try to resolve and say this is the \u2013 this is the true facts here. We\u2019re putting together a description of this issue is going on, here are the parameters of it. And then later on, if we\u2019re making a decision where we have to resolve that, we will. But this is basically to gather up that information, put it in one place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t rank-order countries. We don\u2019t have, like, the good countries going down to the bad. There\u2019s no automatic consequence that flows from these reports. So unlike some of the other ones we do where there are tier rankings and \u2013 or if you meet a certain standard, that we have to cut off foreign assistance or something. This is just a factual report. What we do with it is a later set of decisions, but it often is an important factor in informing those later decisions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne thing we did this year that I would call your attention to is, we\u2019ve noted that it was kind of difficult to compare one country to another. Not that we are trying to do that, but the readers hopefully can do that. And in the executive summary of the reports before, it was a little bit of a grab bag for each country, and in no particular order they would list different human rights issues that had come up in that country. So we\u2019ve tried to standardize it more this year, and there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s usually the third paragraph in the executive summary, we\u2019ll say \u201chuman rights issues included.\u201d And we\u2019ve tried to include there in the same order in every report the most egregious forms of human rights abuse \u2013 torture, extrajudicial killing, forced disappearances, criminalization of libel \u2013 or of expression, criminalization of LGBT consensual sexual activity, violence against people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we\u2019re trying to focus on what is the government doing or not doing about those issues more than just what\u2019s going on in the society. That\u2019s important too, but the focus here is: Is the government taking steps to penalize bad behavior, or is it encouraging it, or ignoring it? And so we\u2019ve tried to make that so that you can make an apples-to-apples comparison by looking at the executive summary of any two countries and say, okay, this one hit these following violations or abuses of human rights, and this other one only hit two or three, or in some cases none at all \u2013 not that there weren\u2019t problems in the country, but that there were no reports of really egregious human rights abuses in the country. And so that comes in in some places.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn any event, with that in mind, I think perhaps I\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you very much, Mr. Ambassador. I\u2019ll quickly remind you of FPC procedure. Please wait for the microphone. When you do get it, please identify yourself by name and outlet. And because we do have a fairly short time here, I\u2019ll ask everyone, please, to limit themselves to one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet me start here, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you, Ambassador Michael. Thank you for the briefing, and you\u2019ve had a colorful career in this area now, particularly in terms of democracy and human rights. I\u2019ll ask about Bangladesh. According to today\u2019s report, 160 people killed in crossfire and 118 individuals in extra \u2013 faced extrajudicial killing. And the situation is like that in Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of democracy, the report mentioned that, that there is no space for the freedom of association, particularly in main opposition, and according to your report the main opposition BNP boycotted the last parliament in 2014. And not the BNP boycotted; this was boycotted by the international community to sending observer like U.S., EU, and we have seen the statement from the State Department which was these nonparticipatory election, it was not in any way an election. And currently, main opposition leader, she is in the jail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how you are assessing to the restoring democracy in Bangladesh and to stop this \u2013 the extrajudicial killing and the \u2013 in terms of democracy, restoring democracy, what is your assessment, and how you will established \u2013 as U.S. is the largest developmental partner of Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, well, I think you read the report well. And of course, one thing I should qualify this, is that this is a report on conditions during the last calendar year, so events that have occurred since that time are not captured in the report. They\u2019ll be in next year\u2019s report, and I think you had some things late in the year like the elections that were \u2013 are coming up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we, I think, have called out for free and fair elections with international monitoring in the country. That\u2019s one way you try to restore or promote democratic competition and openness. We speak frequently with the Government of Bangladesh about how to reduce or eliminate extrajudicial killings or \u2013 it\u2019s usually a debate about whether that\u2019s what it is or whether it\u2019s people killed in crossfire in a legitimate military activity. But it\u2019s something of concern to us. We speak to people about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother thing that applies to Bangladesh and every other country is, if we have information that a particular unit of the security forces is engaged in abuses, we can\u2019t train them or equip them under our law until the government brings the perpetrators of the abuse to justice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo those are just some of the tools that we \u2013 that we try to use to encourage better performance in those areas. And we\u2019ve also, I think, called for an impartial and fair trial of Zia, and not just to let somebody be imprisoned for being a political opponent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo anyway, that\u2019s kind of some of the things that we\u2019re doing. But as I go back to the report, it\u2019s supposed to be describing the conditions in the \u2013 the factual conditions. What we do about that in policy terms varies from country to country, different tools we can use \u2013 statements, not providing equipment, going in and encouraging, sometimes training people so that they improve their human rights performance. So there\u2019s a whole range of activity out there that we can and do use to try to address these kinds of problems. The report\u2019s only about the problem, not about the solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Let me take one more here and then we\u2019ll go to New York. Ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Good afternoon. My name is Kylie Sertic and I work for Kyodo News. I have a question about Japan. The report says that in Japan sexual harassment in the workplace remains widespread, so what does the U.S. urge or expect the Japanese Government to do to improve the situation, and how seriously does the U.S. take this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> I think you also saw that we said that Japan didn\u2019t have any really egregious violations upfront and that they \u2013 there\u2019s no extrajudicial killing and all that kind of thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSexual harassment, unfortunately, is a big problem in a lot of countries, including our own, and what we are trying to urge all governments to do \u2013 and I suspect the Government of Japan is working on this too \u2013 is to institute awareness programs, trainings, and other things to try to get people to understand what is and is not appropriate behavior and how you need to be respectful of other people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn some cases you need to have a penalty. Often in the, like, workplace it\u2019s administrative in the sense of firing the person who\u2019s been doing the harassment, as opposed to prosecuting them, unless it reaches the level of crossing a criminal boundary. So I don\u2019t think we have any doubt that the Government of Japan\u2019s intentions are in the right direction on this issue, but it\u2019s a \u2013 it is a problem in Japan and it\u2019s a problem here and it\u2019s a problem in a lot of places, and one that we all need to work on and try to bring to an end as quickly as we can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>We\u2019ll go to our colleague in New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you, Ambassador. Good afternoon. This is Shehabuddin Kisslu. I have quick two things, sir, to ask. One is, as you \u2013 we have seen that U.S. has very strong statement about the Burmese authority to \u2013 regarding the Rohingya, and you know this very bad situation there. It is getting really safe haven of the criminals there in that situation, especially the women and children are really that are risk. So \u2013 and Burma continuously actually ignoring the international concern \u2013 in that case, actually what is the U.S. stand or what you are actually thinking to go after Burma to make them comply with these international \u2013 I should say the recommendation that has been done by the Mr. Annan commissions, number one?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNumber two is quick thing. Like, as the U.S. and Bangladesh has a very good relation in partnership of security assuring in this region, and as one of my colleague already has asked a question, I \u2013 do you \u2013 what do you see the governments \u2013 how the governments working on those areas? Are \u2013 they are cooperating with you or are \u2013 is the government is very, I mean, sincere to improve the condition or what is supposed to be done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, well, thank you for the question. I \u2013 this is a problem that is just beyond belief. I \u2013 my colleague, Ambassador Brownback, has just been in Bangladesh and was out in the camps where the people from Burma are located, and I think he said this morning that the horrible conditions and the suffering that they have undergone in Burma was just breathtaking. He was very impressed in a negative way as to what had happened to them \u2013 in fact, so much so that he called the Vice President and he sent messages back to the secretary about we need to redouble our efforts on this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we accept this is a huge and serious problem. We appreciate the work that the Government of Bangladesh has been doing to try to bring some relief to these people. I think we just committed another $50 million in relief to try to help in that respect, but the long-term solution, or the real solution, is to make it possible for people to go back to their homes in a safe and secure way and where their homes are rebuilt to the point that they can live in them. As you may know, the \u2013 a lot of the villages people came from have been obliterated and there\u2019s no place for them to go back to at this point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve tried to let the Government of Burma know how seriously we see this. We brought economic sanctions against the senior general who commanded that region of the country, and that is a start, anyway, on letting them know that people should be held accountable for what they did. We are trying our best to get through to the government the need to be serious and to be welcoming of these people, to create a situation where they can come back and be safe and not be \u2013 not have the same cycle occur all over again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. We know that the Government of Bangladesh has been in direct touch with the Government of Burma. We think that\u2019s good, because there needs to be that coordination, but we\u2019re very much on the side of trying to do everything we can to get the government to make it possible for people to come back in a safe and secure way, and in the meantime, to assist the Government of Bangladesh in the important humanitarian relief that it\u2019s providing to the victims of this crime. And it\u2019s a crime of ethnic cleansing, as we have made clear. This was not a chance thing. It was very deliberate and unfortunate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Sir, in the black jacket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. My name is Sumer, from Voice of America Turkey service. There is a more than 60-pages Turkey section in the report; we saw that. And also, as you know, a pastor and two employees of the U.S. embassy are in jail in Turkey, and there are lots of criticizing points about the violations of human rights and freedom of expression in Turkey in your report. And also, yesterday night, yesterday evening, two U.S. senators made a call for sanctions on Turkish officials due to these allegations. Do you think the Trump administration will consider impose sanctions on Turkey after your report and also call made by the U.S. senators?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Well, I\u2019m not going to predict what policy responses that we may have to this, but I would reemphasize the seriousness of the situation, and I think Acting Secretary Sullivan, in introducing the reports this morning, talked about Turkey in particular. Not only do you have Pastor Brunson and our local staff of the embassy in jail there, but I \u2013 when I was looking at what we said in the report, it was 50,000, and my expert told me that now it\u2019s 60,000 people have been jailed under the state of emergency. And so our very clear message to the government has been: It\u2019s time to end the state of emergency, it\u2019s time to have due process for all these people with a fair and independent judicial process, and try to get Turkey back on the track that it for so long had been on of being a very law-abiding, rule-of-law country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\u2019s something that\u2019s very disturbing to us. We\u2019ve been trying to message in every way we can to the government that this \u2013 they really need to step back, take a look at where they\u2019re headed, and try to get back on the right track. But what exact measures we\u2019ll take in addition to those we\u2019ve taken already, I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate. That\u2019s going to be up to the President and others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Take one here and then we\u2019ll go to New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you, Ambassador. When --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Sir, can you give your name and your outlet, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Oh, Paul Huang from The Epoch Times. I know you have increasing concern about religious freedom in China, specifically the persecution of Falun Gong, Tibetans and Uighurs in Xinjiang. What concrete steps have you taken to hold those officials that committed the persecutions accountable? And would you consider applying Global Magnitsky Act to sanction those officials that have committed the persecutions? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Thank you. Yes. I mean, we are extremely concerned about the level of repression, particularly in Xinjiang. In terms of the increase over the last year, it\u2019s been a bad situation for Falun Gong for a long time, it\u2019s been bad for Uighurs, it\u2019s been bad for Tibetans, but there seems to be amping of the level of repression against those groups and against society in general as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur message to China all along has been: If you want to realize the full potential of the Chinese people and have an even stronger economy and so on, opening up is the way to do it, not clamping down. As to whether we would use a particular tool in that endeavor to convince the government, again, I can\u2019t speculate, but we \u2013 Global Magnitsky is a rolling thing. We look at different candidates from time to time for that \u2013 to use that particular tool, and it applies to anybody who does that kind of behavior anywhere in the world. Obviously, you can\u2019t sanction everybody, but you could sanction anybody. So I wouldn\u2019t go into speculating about that now, but I think our message has been very, very clear from the President on down that China needs to move in a different direction on those kinds of issues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>We can go to our colleague in New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Ariana King with the Nikkei Asian Review. In your remarks earlier, you mentioned that there didn\u2019t have to be a tradeoff between concerns about the nuclear issue and the human rights issue in North Korea. I\u2019m wondering if you believe that means that President Trump will push human rights in his denuclearization talks with Kim Jong-un.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd a technical question, if you don\u2019t mind, about the abduction issue: In last year\u2019s report, there was language saying that the North claimed that the investigation was over and there was nothing to report, and this year\u2019s report, it seems to omit that sentence and implies that the investigation is still ongoing. I was wondering if that \u2013 if there was a policy reason for that or why that change was made.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay. Last part first, and I am not familiar with the \u2013 that particular phrase in the reports. My guess is \u2013 one of the editorial rules we have in the report is if something \u2013 if an event occurred in one year, if there is \u2013 the second year after that, you can kind of say where it stands, but if it doesn\u2019t change, we drop it. Otherwise, this thing would just become \u2013 it\u2019s already 2 million pages and it would be \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 several times that many. So it may just be that editorial reason that, since the denial occurred at one point in time and nothing new has happened on that, that we stop talking about it. But I can check if you\u2019d like and see if there\u2019s anything more on that front. I mean, we certainly don\u2019t consider the issue resolved, so that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully is reflected in the report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the issue of tradeoffs, I mean, I think you have seen already the United States has pursued a very strong advocacy on the issue of human rights in North Korea. And as I mentioned in the earlier briefing, we\u2019ve tried to be very supportive of groups and international mechanisms that were set up, the Commission of Inquiry and so on, to try to expose and hopefully by shining a light on, rectify some of those behaviors. We\u2019ve done that even as we have pursued denuclearization. And so what I was alluding to is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incompatible to do both things together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether \u2013 I can\u2019t predict whether the President will say words about both things in one set of talks or another, but I think it\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re already on a course where we\u2019re concerned about both things, we\u2019re pursuing both things, and we don\u2019t see that you \u2013 that the price of solving one is not to stop pursuing the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I think we have time for one more. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m Allen Abel from Maclean\u2019s Magazine of Canada. In a general sense, how does it impact your work when you diligently try to collect factual, empirical evidence, and then the President boils 2 million words down to one word like shithole? How does it impact your work?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Well I\u2019m not going to get into grammatical things, but it doesn\u2019t impact our work that much in terms of producing a report like this and \u2013 and we \u2013 and finding that others in other countries use it. Whatever differences they may have with the United States, or with a particular official in the United States, we\u2019ve gone \u2013 I\u2019ve had this question for years where people will say, \u201cOh, well, because of this, how can you have any credibility?\u201d And what we find is, people that are struggling for their human rights and for democratic freedoms around the world, they\u2019re looking for support and friends where they can find them. And they still see and have, I think, consistently seen the United States as being a friend on that front, as they do your country. Canada has been one of the great allies in that effort. So it\u2019s \u2013 that \u2013 it\u2019s not some \u2013 it\u2019s something that\u2019s much bigger than one comment or one word, and I think the President has already spoken to the factualness of that allegation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I think actually we will take one more in New York, and then for any other questions you may have here, please contact us and we\u2019ll make sure we get them to our colleagues at the bureau. So New York, please go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you so much. Marija Sajkas, Novi Magazin, Serbia. Could you please tell us something about the region of western Balkans, and in particular about Serbia and Kosovo? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Well, I think the report speaks for itself. It\u2019s obviously a complicated situation. We\u2019ve tried to report as clearly as we can on what\u2019s going on there as well as in other parts of the world. But it\u2019s \u2013 it is a difficult one, and if I can find my paper, I will try to give you what I have of our latest guidance on this, as opposed to what\u2019s in the report. I am not finding it. So I think you\u2019ll have to let it go at that. I would suspect we can try to get our press office to follow up too, because we have more current guidance than what\u2019s in the report because there have been developments since.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>If you give your \u2013 if you give your question to the program officers in New York, they\u2019ll pass it along and we\u2019ll make sure it gets answered. And with that, I will thank you all very much for joining us this afternoon, and thank Ambassador Kozak for taking the time to come in and give us a briefing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Thank you all very much, and it\u2019s been a pleasure to be here with you.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t# # #\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for joining us, and thanks to our colleagues in New York. My name is Benjamin Weber. I\u2019m the director of the Foreign Press Centers, and I\u2019m very pleased to welcome our senior official for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Ambassador Michael Kozak, who is going to present this year\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights. I\u2019ll allow him to take a few moments to make some opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll go to questions and answers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay. Thank you very much. I thought I might spend a few minutes going through why we do the reports, what they represent, what they\u2019re used for, and then we can open it up for questions and comments by all of you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 this is the 42nd year that we\u2019ve done the Annual Human Rights Reports, and they\u2019re done as a requirement of U.S. law. This goes back to the 1970s, when Congress said to the Executive Branch, \u201cWhen we\u2019re making decisions about foreign assistance and security assistance and trade agreements and all of that, we\u2019d really like to know: What is the human rights situation in the countries that we\u2019re dealing with?\u201d So they charged the President by law \u2013 or the Secretary of State \u2013 with having to produce this annual report to them that is supposed to report on the situation of human rights in each of the member-nations of the United Nations and a few other territories or areas that we deal with as well. We try to do that \u2013 and it\u2019s internationally recognized human rights, and then there are a few requirements that are added on from the U.S. law specifically.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the reason we do the reports is not to be passing judgment on other countries, or the old word of name and shame; it\u2019s not with that in mind. It\u2019s to fulfill a statutory responsibility to our Congress to try to produce the most accurate description of what we find is going on in other countries so that they can use that in making decisions. And frankly, it gets used then also by our judicial system. For example, when our immigration officers or our immigration judges are assessing asylum claims or refugee claims, they\u2019re matching the person\u2019s story against what they know of country conditions, and they use these reports as a factual baseline for that. We use it in the Executive Branch as well when we\u2019re meeting with foreign officials. It\u2019s the basis on which we can brief the President or the Secretary of State on the human rights situation in that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the whole effort is to make it as factual, as clinical as possible, and not \u2013 we\u2019re not drawing conclusions. We\u2019re reporting what\u2019s out there, and often you\u2019re getting contradictory information. You\u2019ll have a credible source \u2013 media in another country, a respectable newspaper, or a nongovernment organization or something \u2013 saying, \u201cThis happened,\u201d and then you have somebody else saying, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d or, \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen that way.\u201d And we try to reflect both of those things. We don\u2019t try to resolve and say this is the \u2013 this is the true facts here. We\u2019re putting together a description of this issue is going on, here are the parameters of it. And then later on, if we\u2019re making a decision where we have to resolve that, we will. But this is basically to gather up that information, put it in one place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t rank-order countries. We don\u2019t have, like, the good countries going down to the bad. There\u2019s no automatic consequence that flows from these reports. So unlike some of the other ones we do where there are tier rankings and \u2013 or if you meet a certain standard, that we have to cut off foreign assistance or something. This is just a factual report. What we do with it is a later set of decisions, but it often is an important factor in informing those later decisions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne thing we did this year that I would call your attention to is, we\u2019ve noted that it was kind of difficult to compare one country to another. Not that we are trying to do that, but the readers hopefully can do that. And in the executive summary of the reports before, it was a little bit of a grab bag for each country, and in no particular order they would list different human rights issues that had come up in that country. So we\u2019ve tried to standardize it more this year, and there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s usually the third paragraph in the executive summary, we\u2019ll say \u201chuman rights issues included.\u201d And we\u2019ve tried to include there in the same order in every report the most egregious forms of human rights abuse \u2013 torture, extrajudicial killing, forced disappearances, criminalization of libel \u2013 or of expression, criminalization of LGBT consensual sexual activity, violence against people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we\u2019re trying to focus on what is the government doing or not doing about those issues more than just what\u2019s going on in the society. That\u2019s important too, but the focus here is: Is the government taking steps to penalize bad behavior, or is it encouraging it, or ignoring it? And so we\u2019ve tried to make that so that you can make an apples-to-apples comparison by looking at the executive summary of any two countries and say, okay, this one hit these following violations or abuses of human rights, and this other one only hit two or three, or in some cases none at all \u2013 not that there weren\u2019t problems in the country, but that there were no reports of really egregious human rights abuses in the country. And so that comes in in some places.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn any event, with that in mind, I think perhaps I\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you very much, Mr. Ambassador. I\u2019ll quickly remind you of FPC procedure. Please wait for the microphone. When you do get it, please identify yourself by name and outlet. And because we do have a fairly short time here, I\u2019ll ask everyone, please, to limit themselves to one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet me start here, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you, Ambassador Michael. Thank you for the briefing, and you\u2019ve had a colorful career in this area now, particularly in terms of democracy and human rights. I\u2019ll ask about Bangladesh. According to today\u2019s report, 160 people killed in crossfire and 118 individuals in extra \u2013 faced extrajudicial killing. And the situation is like that in Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of democracy, the report mentioned that, that there is no space for the freedom of association, particularly in main opposition, and according to your report the main opposition BNP boycotted the last parliament in 2014. And not the BNP boycotted; this was boycotted by the international community to sending observer like U.S., EU, and we have seen the statement from the State Department which was these nonparticipatory election, it was not in any way an election. And currently, main opposition leader, she is in the jail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how you are assessing to the restoring democracy in Bangladesh and to stop this \u2013 the extrajudicial killing and the \u2013 in terms of democracy, restoring democracy, what is your assessment, and how you will established \u2013 as U.S. is the largest developmental partner of Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, well, I think you read the report well. And of course, one thing I should qualify this, is that this is a report on conditions during the last calendar year, so events that have occurred since that time are not captured in the report. They\u2019ll be in next year\u2019s report, and I think you had some things late in the year like the elections that were \u2013 are coming up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we, I think, have called out for free and fair elections with international monitoring in the country. That\u2019s one way you try to restore or promote democratic competition and openness. We speak frequently with the Government of Bangladesh about how to reduce or eliminate extrajudicial killings or \u2013 it\u2019s usually a debate about whether that\u2019s what it is or whether it\u2019s people killed in crossfire in a legitimate military activity. But it\u2019s something of concern to us. We speak to people about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother thing that applies to Bangladesh and every other country is, if we have information that a particular unit of the security forces is engaged in abuses, we can\u2019t train them or equip them under our law until the government brings the perpetrators of the abuse to justice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo those are just some of the tools that we \u2013 that we try to use to encourage better performance in those areas. And we\u2019ve also, I think, called for an impartial and fair trial of Zia, and not just to let somebody be imprisoned for being a political opponent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo anyway, that\u2019s kind of some of the things that we\u2019re doing. But as I go back to the report, it\u2019s supposed to be describing the conditions in the \u2013 the factual conditions. What we do about that in policy terms varies from country to country, different tools we can use \u2013 statements, not providing equipment, going in and encouraging, sometimes training people so that they improve their human rights performance. So there\u2019s a whole range of activity out there that we can and do use to try to address these kinds of problems. The report\u2019s only about the problem, not about the solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Let me take one more here and then we\u2019ll go to New York. Ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Good afternoon. My name is Kylie Sertic and I work for Kyodo News. I have a question about Japan. The report says that in Japan sexual harassment in the workplace remains widespread, so what does the U.S. urge or expect the Japanese Government to do to improve the situation, and how seriously does the U.S. take this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> I think you also saw that we said that Japan didn\u2019t have any really egregious violations upfront and that they \u2013 there\u2019s no extrajudicial killing and all that kind of thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSexual harassment, unfortunately, is a big problem in a lot of countries, including our own, and what we are trying to urge all governments to do \u2013 and I suspect the Government of Japan is working on this too \u2013 is to institute awareness programs, trainings, and other things to try to get people to understand what is and is not appropriate behavior and how you need to be respectful of other people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn some cases you need to have a penalty. Often in the, like, workplace it\u2019s administrative in the sense of firing the person who\u2019s been doing the harassment, as opposed to prosecuting them, unless it reaches the level of crossing a criminal boundary. So I don\u2019t think we have any doubt that the Government of Japan\u2019s intentions are in the right direction on this issue, but it\u2019s a \u2013 it is a problem in Japan and it\u2019s a problem here and it\u2019s a problem in a lot of places, and one that we all need to work on and try to bring to an end as quickly as we can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>We\u2019ll go to our colleague in New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you, Ambassador. Good afternoon. This is Shehabuddin Kisslu. I have quick two things, sir, to ask. One is, as you \u2013 we have seen that U.S. has very strong statement about the Burmese authority to \u2013 regarding the Rohingya, and you know this very bad situation there. It is getting really safe haven of the criminals there in that situation, especially the women and children are really that are risk. So \u2013 and Burma continuously actually ignoring the international concern \u2013 in that case, actually what is the U.S. stand or what you are actually thinking to go after Burma to make them comply with these international \u2013 I should say the recommendation that has been done by the Mr. Annan commissions, number one?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNumber two is quick thing. Like, as the U.S. and Bangladesh has a very good relation in partnership of security assuring in this region, and as one of my colleague already has asked a question, I \u2013 do you \u2013 what do you see the governments \u2013 how the governments working on those areas? Are \u2013 they are cooperating with you or are \u2013 is the government is very, I mean, sincere to improve the condition or what is supposed to be done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, well, thank you for the question. I \u2013 this is a problem that is just beyond belief. I \u2013 my colleague, Ambassador Brownback, has just been in Bangladesh and was out in the camps where the people from Burma are located, and I think he said this morning that the horrible conditions and the suffering that they have undergone in Burma was just breathtaking. He was very impressed in a negative way as to what had happened to them \u2013 in fact, so much so that he called the Vice President and he sent messages back to the secretary about we need to redouble our efforts on this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we accept this is a huge and serious problem. We appreciate the work that the Government of Bangladesh has been doing to try to bring some relief to these people. I think we just committed another $50 million in relief to try to help in that respect, but the long-term solution, or the real solution, is to make it possible for people to go back to their homes in a safe and secure way and where their homes are rebuilt to the point that they can live in them. As you may know, the \u2013 a lot of the villages people came from have been obliterated and there\u2019s no place for them to go back to at this point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve tried to let the Government of Burma know how seriously we see this. We brought economic sanctions against the senior general who commanded that region of the country, and that is a start, anyway, on letting them know that people should be held accountable for what they did. We are trying our best to get through to the government the need to be serious and to be welcoming of these people, to create a situation where they can come back and be safe and not be \u2013 not have the same cycle occur all over again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. We know that the Government of Bangladesh has been in direct touch with the Government of Burma. We think that\u2019s good, because there needs to be that coordination, but we\u2019re very much on the side of trying to do everything we can to get the government to make it possible for people to come back in a safe and secure way, and in the meantime, to assist the Government of Bangladesh in the important humanitarian relief that it\u2019s providing to the victims of this crime. And it\u2019s a crime of ethnic cleansing, as we have made clear. This was not a chance thing. It was very deliberate and unfortunate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Sir, in the black jacket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. My name is Sumer, from Voice of America Turkey service. There is a more than 60-pages Turkey section in the report; we saw that. And also, as you know, a pastor and two employees of the U.S. embassy are in jail in Turkey, and there are lots of criticizing points about the violations of human rights and freedom of expression in Turkey in your report. And also, yesterday night, yesterday evening, two U.S. senators made a call for sanctions on Turkish officials due to these allegations. Do you think the Trump administration will consider impose sanctions on Turkey after your report and also call made by the U.S. senators?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Well, I\u2019m not going to predict what policy responses that we may have to this, but I would reemphasize the seriousness of the situation, and I think Acting Secretary Sullivan, in introducing the reports this morning, talked about Turkey in particular. Not only do you have Pastor Brunson and our local staff of the embassy in jail there, but I \u2013 when I was looking at what we said in the report, it was 50,000, and my expert told me that now it\u2019s 60,000 people have been jailed under the state of emergency. And so our very clear message to the government has been: It\u2019s time to end the state of emergency, it\u2019s time to have due process for all these people with a fair and independent judicial process, and try to get Turkey back on the track that it for so long had been on of being a very law-abiding, rule-of-law country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\u2019s something that\u2019s very disturbing to us. We\u2019ve been trying to message in every way we can to the government that this \u2013 they really need to step back, take a look at where they\u2019re headed, and try to get back on the right track. But what exact measures we\u2019ll take in addition to those we\u2019ve taken already, I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate. That\u2019s going to be up to the President and others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Take one here and then we\u2019ll go to New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you, Ambassador. When --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Sir, can you give your name and your outlet, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Oh, Paul Huang from The Epoch Times. I know you have increasing concern about religious freedom in China, specifically the persecution of Falun Gong, Tibetans and Uighurs in Xinjiang. What concrete steps have you taken to hold those officials that committed the persecutions accountable? And would you consider applying Global Magnitsky Act to sanction those officials that have committed the persecutions? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Thank you. Yes. I mean, we are extremely concerned about the level of repression, particularly in Xinjiang. In terms of the increase over the last year, it\u2019s been a bad situation for Falun Gong for a long time, it\u2019s been bad for Uighurs, it\u2019s been bad for Tibetans, but there seems to be amping of the level of repression against those groups and against society in general as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur message to China all along has been: If you want to realize the full potential of the Chinese people and have an even stronger economy and so on, opening up is the way to do it, not clamping down. As to whether we would use a particular tool in that endeavor to convince the government, again, I can\u2019t speculate, but we \u2013 Global Magnitsky is a rolling thing. We look at different candidates from time to time for that \u2013 to use that particular tool, and it applies to anybody who does that kind of behavior anywhere in the world. Obviously, you can\u2019t sanction everybody, but you could sanction anybody. So I wouldn\u2019t go into speculating about that now, but I think our message has been very, very clear from the President on down that China needs to move in a different direction on those kinds of issues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>We can go to our colleague in New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Ariana King with the Nikkei Asian Review. In your remarks earlier, you mentioned that there didn\u2019t have to be a tradeoff between concerns about the nuclear issue and the human rights issue in North Korea. I\u2019m wondering if you believe that means that President Trump will push human rights in his denuclearization talks with Kim Jong-un.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd a technical question, if you don\u2019t mind, about the abduction issue: In last year\u2019s report, there was language saying that the North claimed that the investigation was over and there was nothing to report, and this year\u2019s report, it seems to omit that sentence and implies that the investigation is still ongoing. I was wondering if that \u2013 if there was a policy reason for that or why that change was made.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay. Last part first, and I am not familiar with the \u2013 that particular phrase in the reports. My guess is \u2013 one of the editorial rules we have in the report is if something \u2013 if an event occurred in one year, if there is \u2013 the second year after that, you can kind of say where it stands, but if it doesn\u2019t change, we drop it. Otherwise, this thing would just become \u2013 it\u2019s already 2 million pages and it would be \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 several times that many. So it may just be that editorial reason that, since the denial occurred at one point in time and nothing new has happened on that, that we stop talking about it. But I can check if you\u2019d like and see if there\u2019s anything more on that front. I mean, we certainly don\u2019t consider the issue resolved, so that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully is reflected in the report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the issue of tradeoffs, I mean, I think you have seen already the United States has pursued a very strong advocacy on the issue of human rights in North Korea. And as I mentioned in the earlier briefing, we\u2019ve tried to be very supportive of groups and international mechanisms that were set up, the Commission of Inquiry and so on, to try to expose and hopefully by shining a light on, rectify some of those behaviors. We\u2019ve done that even as we have pursued denuclearization. And so what I was alluding to is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incompatible to do both things together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether \u2013 I can\u2019t predict whether the President will say words about both things in one set of talks or another, but I think it\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re already on a course where we\u2019re concerned about both things, we\u2019re pursuing both things, and we don\u2019t see that you \u2013 that the price of solving one is not to stop pursuing the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I think we have time for one more. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m Allen Abel from Maclean\u2019s Magazine of Canada. In a general sense, how does it impact your work when you diligently try to collect factual, empirical evidence, and then the President boils 2 million words down to one word like shithole? How does it impact your work?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Well I\u2019m not going to get into grammatical things, but it doesn\u2019t impact our work that much in terms of producing a report like this and \u2013 and we \u2013 and finding that others in other countries use it. Whatever differences they may have with the United States, or with a particular official in the United States, we\u2019ve gone \u2013 I\u2019ve had this question for years where people will say, \u201cOh, well, because of this, how can you have any credibility?\u201d And what we find is, people that are struggling for their human rights and for democratic freedoms around the world, they\u2019re looking for support and friends where they can find them. And they still see and have, I think, consistently seen the United States as being a friend on that front, as they do your country. Canada has been one of the great allies in that effort. So it\u2019s \u2013 that \u2013 it\u2019s not some \u2013 it\u2019s something that\u2019s much bigger than one comment or one word, and I think the President has already spoken to the factualness of that allegation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I think actually we will take one more in New York, and then for any other questions you may have here, please contact us and we\u2019ll make sure we get them to our colleagues at the bureau. So New York, please go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you so much. Marija Sajkas, Novi Magazin, Serbia. Could you please tell us something about the region of western Balkans, and in particular about Serbia and Kosovo? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Well, I think the report speaks for itself. It\u2019s obviously a complicated situation. We\u2019ve tried to report as clearly as we can on what\u2019s going on there as well as in other parts of the world. But it\u2019s \u2013 it is a difficult one, and if I can find my paper, I will try to give you what I have of our latest guidance on this, as opposed to what\u2019s in the report. I am not finding it. So I think you\u2019ll have to let it go at that. I would suspect we can try to get our press office to follow up too, because we have more current guidance than what\u2019s in the report because there have been developments since.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>If you give your \u2013 if you give your question to the program officers in New York, they\u2019ll pass it along and we\u2019ll make sure it gets answered. And with that, I will thank you all very much for joining us this afternoon, and thank Ambassador Kozak for taking the time to come in and give us a briefing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Thank you all very much, and it\u2019s been a pleasure to be here with you.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t# # #\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for joining us, and thanks to our colleagues in New York. My name is Benjamin Weber. I\u2019m the director of the Foreign Press Centers, and I\u2019m very pleased to welcome our senior official for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Ambassador Michael Kozak, who is going to present this year\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights. I\u2019ll allow him to take a few moments to make some opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll go to questions and answers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay. Thank you very much. I thought I might spend a few minutes going through why we do the reports, what they represent, what they\u2019re used for, and then we can open it up for questions and comments by all of you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 this is the 42nd year that we\u2019ve done the Annual Human Rights Reports, and they\u2019re done as a requirement of U.S. law. This goes back to the 1970s, when Congress said to the Executive Branch, \u201cWhen we\u2019re making decisions about foreign assistance and security assistance and trade agreements and all of that, we\u2019d really like to know: What is the human rights situation in the countries that we\u2019re dealing with?\u201d So they charged the President by law \u2013 or the Secretary of State \u2013 with having to produce this annual report to them that is supposed to report on the situation of human rights in each of the member-nations of the United Nations and a few other territories or areas that we deal with as well. We try to do that \u2013 and it\u2019s internationally recognized human rights, and then there are a few requirements that are added on from the U.S. law specifically.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the reason we do the reports is not to be passing judgment on other countries, or the old word of name and shame; it\u2019s not with that in mind. It\u2019s to fulfill a statutory responsibility to our Congress to try to produce the most accurate description of what we find is going on in other countries so that they can use that in making decisions. And frankly, it gets used then also by our judicial system. For example, when our immigration officers or our immigration judges are assessing asylum claims or refugee claims, they\u2019re matching the person\u2019s story against what they know of country conditions, and they use these reports as a factual baseline for that. We use it in the Executive Branch as well when we\u2019re meeting with foreign officials. It\u2019s the basis on which we can brief the President or the Secretary of State on the human rights situation in that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the whole effort is to make it as factual, as clinical as possible, and not \u2013 we\u2019re not drawing conclusions. We\u2019re reporting what\u2019s out there, and often you\u2019re getting contradictory information. You\u2019ll have a credible source \u2013 media in another country, a respectable newspaper, or a nongovernment organization or something \u2013 saying, \u201cThis happened,\u201d and then you have somebody else saying, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d or, \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen that way.\u201d And we try to reflect both of those things. We don\u2019t try to resolve and say this is the \u2013 this is the true facts here. We\u2019re putting together a description of this issue is going on, here are the parameters of it. And then later on, if we\u2019re making a decision where we have to resolve that, we will. But this is basically to gather up that information, put it in one place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t rank-order countries. We don\u2019t have, like, the good countries going down to the bad. There\u2019s no automatic consequence that flows from these reports. So unlike some of the other ones we do where there are tier rankings and \u2013 or if you meet a certain standard, that we have to cut off foreign assistance or something. This is just a factual report. What we do with it is a later set of decisions, but it often is an important factor in informing those later decisions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne thing we did this year that I would call your attention to is, we\u2019ve noted that it was kind of difficult to compare one country to another. Not that we are trying to do that, but the readers hopefully can do that. And in the executive summary of the reports before, it was a little bit of a grab bag for each country, and in no particular order they would list different human rights issues that had come up in that country. So we\u2019ve tried to standardize it more this year, and there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s usually the third paragraph in the executive summary, we\u2019ll say \u201chuman rights issues included.\u201d And we\u2019ve tried to include there in the same order in every report the most egregious forms of human rights abuse \u2013 torture, extrajudicial killing, forced disappearances, criminalization of libel \u2013 or of expression, criminalization of LGBT consensual sexual activity, violence against people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we\u2019re trying to focus on what is the government doing or not doing about those issues more than just what\u2019s going on in the society. That\u2019s important too, but the focus here is: Is the government taking steps to penalize bad behavior, or is it encouraging it, or ignoring it? And so we\u2019ve tried to make that so that you can make an apples-to-apples comparison by looking at the executive summary of any two countries and say, okay, this one hit these following violations or abuses of human rights, and this other one only hit two or three, or in some cases none at all \u2013 not that there weren\u2019t problems in the country, but that there were no reports of really egregious human rights abuses in the country. And so that comes in in some places.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn any event, with that in mind, I think perhaps I\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Thank you very much, Mr. Ambassador. I\u2019ll quickly remind you of FPC procedure. Please wait for the microphone. When you do get it, please identify yourself by name and outlet. And because we do have a fairly short time here, I\u2019ll ask everyone, please, to limit themselves to one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet me start here, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you, Ambassador Michael. Thank you for the briefing, and you\u2019ve had a colorful career in this area now, particularly in terms of democracy and human rights. I\u2019ll ask about Bangladesh. According to today\u2019s report, 160 people killed in crossfire and 118 individuals in extra \u2013 faced extrajudicial killing. And the situation is like that in Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of democracy, the report mentioned that, that there is no space for the freedom of association, particularly in main opposition, and according to your report the main opposition BNP boycotted the last parliament in 2014. And not the BNP boycotted; this was boycotted by the international community to sending observer like U.S., EU, and we have seen the statement from the State Department which was these nonparticipatory election, it was not in any way an election. And currently, main opposition leader, she is in the jail.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how you are assessing to the restoring democracy in Bangladesh and to stop this \u2013 the extrajudicial killing and the \u2013 in terms of democracy, restoring democracy, what is your assessment, and how you will established \u2013 as U.S. is the largest developmental partner of Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, well, I think you read the report well. And of course, one thing I should qualify this, is that this is a report on conditions during the last calendar year, so events that have occurred since that time are not captured in the report. They\u2019ll be in next year\u2019s report, and I think you had some things late in the year like the elections that were \u2013 are coming up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we, I think, have called out for free and fair elections with international monitoring in the country. That\u2019s one way you try to restore or promote democratic competition and openness. We speak frequently with the Government of Bangladesh about how to reduce or eliminate extrajudicial killings or \u2013 it\u2019s usually a debate about whether that\u2019s what it is or whether it\u2019s people killed in crossfire in a legitimate military activity. But it\u2019s something of concern to us. We speak to people about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother thing that applies to Bangladesh and every other country is, if we have information that a particular unit of the security forces is engaged in abuses, we can\u2019t train them or equip them under our law until the government brings the perpetrators of the abuse to justice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo those are just some of the tools that we \u2013 that we try to use to encourage better performance in those areas. And we\u2019ve also, I think, called for an impartial and fair trial of Zia, and not just to let somebody be imprisoned for being a political opponent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo anyway, that\u2019s kind of some of the things that we\u2019re doing. But as I go back to the report, it\u2019s supposed to be describing the conditions in the \u2013 the factual conditions. What we do about that in policy terms varies from country to country, different tools we can use \u2013 statements, not providing equipment, going in and encouraging, sometimes training people so that they improve their human rights performance. So there\u2019s a whole range of activity out there that we can and do use to try to address these kinds of problems. The report\u2019s only about the problem, not about the solution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Let me take one more here and then we\u2019ll go to New York. Ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Good afternoon. My name is Kylie Sertic and I work for Kyodo News. I have a question about Japan. The report says that in Japan sexual harassment in the workplace remains widespread, so what does the U.S. urge or expect the Japanese Government to do to improve the situation, and how seriously does the U.S. take this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> I think you also saw that we said that Japan didn\u2019t have any really egregious violations upfront and that they \u2013 there\u2019s no extrajudicial killing and all that kind of thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSexual harassment, unfortunately, is a big problem in a lot of countries, including our own, and what we are trying to urge all governments to do \u2013 and I suspect the Government of Japan is working on this too \u2013 is to institute awareness programs, trainings, and other things to try to get people to understand what is and is not appropriate behavior and how you need to be respectful of other people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn some cases you need to have a penalty. Often in the, like, workplace it\u2019s administrative in the sense of firing the person who\u2019s been doing the harassment, as opposed to prosecuting them, unless it reaches the level of crossing a criminal boundary. So I don\u2019t think we have any doubt that the Government of Japan\u2019s intentions are in the right direction on this issue, but it\u2019s a \u2013 it is a problem in Japan and it\u2019s a problem here and it\u2019s a problem in a lot of places, and one that we all need to work on and try to bring to an end as quickly as we can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>We\u2019ll go to our colleague in New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you, Ambassador. Good afternoon. This is Shehabuddin Kisslu. I have quick two things, sir, to ask. One is, as you \u2013 we have seen that U.S. has very strong statement about the Burmese authority to \u2013 regarding the Rohingya, and you know this very bad situation there. It is getting really safe haven of the criminals there in that situation, especially the women and children are really that are risk. So \u2013 and Burma continuously actually ignoring the international concern \u2013 in that case, actually what is the U.S. stand or what you are actually thinking to go after Burma to make them comply with these international \u2013 I should say the recommendation that has been done by the Mr. Annan commissions, number one?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNumber two is quick thing. Like, as the U.S. and Bangladesh has a very good relation in partnership of security assuring in this region, and as one of my colleague already has asked a question, I \u2013 do you \u2013 what do you see the governments \u2013 how the governments working on those areas? Are \u2013 they are cooperating with you or are \u2013 is the government is very, I mean, sincere to improve the condition or what is supposed to be done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, well, thank you for the question. I \u2013 this is a problem that is just beyond belief. I \u2013 my colleague, Ambassador Brownback, has just been in Bangladesh and was out in the camps where the people from Burma are located, and I think he said this morning that the horrible conditions and the suffering that they have undergone in Burma was just breathtaking. He was very impressed in a negative way as to what had happened to them \u2013 in fact, so much so that he called the Vice President and he sent messages back to the secretary about we need to redouble our efforts on this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we accept this is a huge and serious problem. We appreciate the work that the Government of Bangladesh has been doing to try to bring some relief to these people. I think we just committed another $50 million in relief to try to help in that respect, but the long-term solution, or the real solution, is to make it possible for people to go back to their homes in a safe and secure way and where their homes are rebuilt to the point that they can live in them. As you may know, the \u2013 a lot of the villages people came from have been obliterated and there\u2019s no place for them to go back to at this point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve tried to let the Government of Burma know how seriously we see this. We brought economic sanctions against the senior general who commanded that region of the country, and that is a start, anyway, on letting them know that people should be held accountable for what they did. We are trying our best to get through to the government the need to be serious and to be welcoming of these people, to create a situation where they can come back and be safe and not be \u2013 not have the same cycle occur all over again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. We know that the Government of Bangladesh has been in direct touch with the Government of Burma. We think that\u2019s good, because there needs to be that coordination, but we\u2019re very much on the side of trying to do everything we can to get the government to make it possible for people to come back in a safe and secure way, and in the meantime, to assist the Government of Bangladesh in the important humanitarian relief that it\u2019s providing to the victims of this crime. And it\u2019s a crime of ethnic cleansing, as we have made clear. This was not a chance thing. It was very deliberate and unfortunate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Sir, in the black jacket.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. My name is Sumer, from Voice of America Turkey service. There is a more than 60-pages Turkey section in the report; we saw that. And also, as you know, a pastor and two employees of the U.S. embassy are in jail in Turkey, and there are lots of criticizing points about the violations of human rights and freedom of expression in Turkey in your report. And also, yesterday night, yesterday evening, two U.S. senators made a call for sanctions on Turkish officials due to these allegations. Do you think the Trump administration will consider impose sanctions on Turkey after your report and also call made by the U.S. senators?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Well, I\u2019m not going to predict what policy responses that we may have to this, but I would reemphasize the seriousness of the situation, and I think Acting Secretary Sullivan, in introducing the reports this morning, talked about Turkey in particular. Not only do you have Pastor Brunson and our local staff of the embassy in jail there, but I \u2013 when I was looking at what we said in the report, it was 50,000, and my expert told me that now it\u2019s 60,000 people have been jailed under the state of emergency. And so our very clear message to the government has been: It\u2019s time to end the state of emergency, it\u2019s time to have due process for all these people with a fair and independent judicial process, and try to get Turkey back on the track that it for so long had been on of being a very law-abiding, rule-of-law country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\u2019s something that\u2019s very disturbing to us. We\u2019ve been trying to message in every way we can to the government that this \u2013 they really need to step back, take a look at where they\u2019re headed, and try to get back on the right track. But what exact measures we\u2019ll take in addition to those we\u2019ve taken already, I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate. That\u2019s going to be up to the President and others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Take one here and then we\u2019ll go to New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you, Ambassador. When --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Sir, can you give your name and your outlet, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Oh, Paul Huang from The Epoch Times. I know you have increasing concern about religious freedom in China, specifically the persecution of Falun Gong, Tibetans and Uighurs in Xinjiang. What concrete steps have you taken to hold those officials that committed the persecutions accountable? And would you consider applying Global Magnitsky Act to sanction those officials that have committed the persecutions? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Thank you. Yes. I mean, we are extremely concerned about the level of repression, particularly in Xinjiang. In terms of the increase over the last year, it\u2019s been a bad situation for Falun Gong for a long time, it\u2019s been bad for Uighurs, it\u2019s been bad for Tibetans, but there seems to be amping of the level of repression against those groups and against society in general as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur message to China all along has been: If you want to realize the full potential of the Chinese people and have an even stronger economy and so on, opening up is the way to do it, not clamping down. As to whether we would use a particular tool in that endeavor to convince the government, again, I can\u2019t speculate, but we \u2013 Global Magnitsky is a rolling thing. We look at different candidates from time to time for that \u2013 to use that particular tool, and it applies to anybody who does that kind of behavior anywhere in the world. Obviously, you can\u2019t sanction everybody, but you could sanction anybody. So I wouldn\u2019t go into speculating about that now, but I think our message has been very, very clear from the President on down that China needs to move in a different direction on those kinds of issues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>We can go to our colleague in New York, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Ariana King with the Nikkei Asian Review. In your remarks earlier, you mentioned that there didn\u2019t have to be a tradeoff between concerns about the nuclear issue and the human rights issue in North Korea. I\u2019m wondering if you believe that means that President Trump will push human rights in his denuclearization talks with Kim Jong-un.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd a technical question, if you don\u2019t mind, about the abduction issue: In last year\u2019s report, there was language saying that the North claimed that the investigation was over and there was nothing to report, and this year\u2019s report, it seems to omit that sentence and implies that the investigation is still ongoing. I was wondering if that \u2013 if there was a policy reason for that or why that change was made.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay. Last part first, and I am not familiar with the \u2013 that particular phrase in the reports. My guess is \u2013 one of the editorial rules we have in the report is if something \u2013 if an event occurred in one year, if there is \u2013 the second year after that, you can kind of say where it stands, but if it doesn\u2019t change, we drop it. Otherwise, this thing would just become \u2013 it\u2019s already 2 million pages and it would be \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 several times that many. So it may just be that editorial reason that, since the denial occurred at one point in time and nothing new has happened on that, that we stop talking about it. But I can check if you\u2019d like and see if there\u2019s anything more on that front. I mean, we certainly don\u2019t consider the issue resolved, so that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully is reflected in the report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the issue of tradeoffs, I mean, I think you have seen already the United States has pursued a very strong advocacy on the issue of human rights in North Korea. And as I mentioned in the earlier briefing, we\u2019ve tried to be very supportive of groups and international mechanisms that were set up, the Commission of Inquiry and so on, to try to expose and hopefully by shining a light on, rectify some of those behaviors. We\u2019ve done that even as we have pursued denuclearization. And so what I was alluding to is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incompatible to do both things together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether \u2013 I can\u2019t predict whether the President will say words about both things in one set of talks or another, but I think it\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re already on a course where we\u2019re concerned about both things, we\u2019re pursuing both things, and we don\u2019t see that you \u2013 that the price of solving one is not to stop pursuing the other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I think we have time for one more. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m Allen Abel from Maclean\u2019s Magazine of Canada. In a general sense, how does it impact your work when you diligently try to collect factual, empirical evidence, and then the President boils 2 million words down to one word like shithole? How does it impact your work?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Well I\u2019m not going to get into grammatical things, but it doesn\u2019t impact our work that much in terms of producing a report like this and \u2013 and we \u2013 and finding that others in other countries use it. Whatever differences they may have with the United States, or with a particular official in the United States, we\u2019ve gone \u2013 I\u2019ve had this question for years where people will say, \u201cOh, well, because of this, how can you have any credibility?\u201d And what we find is, people that are struggling for their human rights and for democratic freedoms around the world, they\u2019re looking for support and friends where they can find them. And they still see and have, I think, consistently seen the United States as being a friend on that front, as they do your country. Canada has been one of the great allies in that effort. So it\u2019s \u2013 that \u2013 it\u2019s not some \u2013 it\u2019s something that\u2019s much bigger than one comment or one word, and I think the President has already spoken to the factualness of that allegation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I think actually we will take one more in New York, and then for any other questions you may have here, please contact us and we\u2019ll make sure we get them to our colleagues at the bureau. So New York, please go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you so much. Marija Sajkas, Novi Magazin, Serbia. Could you please tell us something about the region of western Balkans, and in particular about Serbia and Kosovo? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Well, I think the report speaks for itself. It\u2019s obviously a complicated situation. We\u2019ve tried to report as clearly as we can on what\u2019s going on there as well as in other parts of the world. But it\u2019s \u2013 it is a difficult one, and if I can find my paper, I will try to give you what I have of our latest guidance on this, as opposed to what\u2019s in the report. I am not finding it. So I think you\u2019ll have to let it go at that. I would suspect we can try to get our press office to follow up too, because we have more current guidance than what\u2019s in the report because there have been developments since.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>If you give your \u2013 if you give your question to the program officers in New York, they\u2019ll pass it along and we\u2019ll make sure it gets answered. And with that, I will thank you all very much for joining us this afternoon, and thank Ambassador Kozak for taking the time to come in and give us a briefing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Thank you all very much, and it\u2019s been a pleasure to be here with you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you for being here. Welcome to the Washington Foreign Press Center. I am Cheryl Neely, the media relations officer for Europe. We\u2019re pleased to have you and our special guest here to update today on negotiations regarding Ukraine. Before I introduce the speaker, I\u2019d like to go over the ground rules. The briefing is on the record, off video camera. Still photography is okay and recording is okay. And please remember to silence or turn off your cell phones. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right. We have with us today Ambassador Kurt Volker, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations. He was appointed to his position in July of 2017. He is a leading expert in U.S. foreign and national security policy with 30 years of experience in a variety of government, academic, and private sector capacities. Your \u2013 the complete bio was linked in your invitation, and it\u2019s also available on the state.gov website, as well as we have copies at the front. So we will open it up to Ambassador Volker, and then when he finishes his remarks, I\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll take Q&amp;A. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> Great, thank you very much. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. Thanks for coming out. It\u2019s a busy news week, so I appreciate your taking a little time for Ukraine. I just thought that it would be useful to talk a little bit about where we are with the conflict in eastern Ukraine since sometime it flares up and then it\u2019s sort of below the headlines again and then it flares up again, and I just wanted to give a little perspective on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe first thing that I\u2019d want to say is the humanitarian situation facing Ukrainian citizens in the Donbas, both sides of the line of conflict, is really intolerable. There are thousands of people affected by this conflict, if not millions, every day. Over 10,300 people have been killed as a result of the conflict on both sides of the line. Over 24,000 people have been wounded. We have well over a million, probably closer to 2 million, displaced persons. And you have impacts of the ongoing conflict all the time. There are ceasefire violations that take place every night. There\u2019s the use of rockets, snipers, mortars. There are occasional shutoffs \u2013 water, electricity, cell phone service has been an issue. The normal economy of the region has been completely disrupted. There are horrendous environmental consequences from the conflict, and these threaten to get much worse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd there has really been no material change in what\u2019s happening on the ground for years now, we're talking really since the end of 2014 until now. So it\u2019s three and a half years at least of an ongoing conflict, a hot war \u2013 not a frozen conflict, a hot war \u2013 with people dying and people fighting, and it really needs to be brought to an end for the benefit of the people that live there. It is a conflict that has been brought to them, not one that anyone is asking for or anyone wants to see continue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is not an indigenous conflict in Ukraine. It\u2019s not a civil war. It\u2019s not an ethnic conflict. It\u2019s the result of Russia invading and occupying territory in Ukraine. You all know that they have taken Crimea and claim to have annexed Crimea. The case of eastern Ukraine, they have set up two people\u2019s republics, they call them \u2013 so-called Luhansk People\u2019s Republic and Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, entities that have no place under the Ukrainian constitution and entities that were not created and chosen by people there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere is a peace agreement, which is in some ways ironic because there isn\u2019t peace. But there is a peace agreement, the Minsk agreements, in which there is a pathway. There is a pathway to political reforms, and steps that the Ukrainians are prepared to take, and a pathway to restoring the territory to Ukrainian sovereignty, Ukrainian territorial integrity. Unfortunately, this has not been implemented. There has never been a period of a sustained ceasefire. There has not been security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I should add that the conflict is driven clearly by Russian forces. There is 100 percent command and control by Russia of the military forces in the east, and also of the political entities. So it is a conflict that Russia has chosen to inflict on this territory, and it has continued up until this point. So the humanitarian costs are extreme.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe \u2013 Russia\u2019s responsibility is important here, because it is a signatory to the Minsk agreements. It is a part of the Normandy process, along with Germany and France and Ukraine, that has talked about a resolution, but in reality, the actions on the ground have undercut the agreements and undercut the diplomatic efforts. So it is really important that Russia make a serious decision, a concrete decision, a real decision to bring about peace. I think that one can only say that peace is in Russia\u2019s hands. Everyone else wants there to be peace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd to that end, and third, we have been engaged \u2013 we, the United States have been engaged \u2013 in diplomatic efforts for some time, working with France and Germany, working with Ukraine, coordinating with NATO allies, with Canada, with the UK, with the EU, with the OSCE, all aimed at putting together how \u2013 putting together the package that would allow peace to be established, Minsk agreements to be implemented, and the conflict finally to be brought to an end.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd that would involve the introduction of a UN-mandated peacekeeping force. This would be on the basis of voluntary national contributions, but it would be a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, and it would be able to assure security in the territory that is now occupied by Russia, so Russia would be able to withdraw its forces but without chaos, without escalating the conflict, without a failure to implement the Minsk agreements. Instead, you would have a UN-mandated force come in, it would establish security; it would create the conditions for holding local elections, which is part of the Minsk agreements; it would maintain security while a special status for this territory under Ukraine\u2019s constitution is implemented, while amnesty is implemented for people who committed crimes as part of the conflict, so that all of the aspects of the Minsk agreements would be implemented. And at the end of that, you would see the territory restored to Ukraine\u2019s control. That is a proposal that I think works \u2013 should work for everyone. It is something that is entirely consistent with the Minsk agreements and is actually a vehicle for moving forward with their full implementation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have discussed this in negotiations with Russia over the course of four different meetings \u2013 in August, October, November, and January. We are looking forward to hearing from Russia based on the discussions that we had at our last meeting, which was in January. Thus far, it\u2019s been over three months. We have not heard anything back from Russia to address this concept and this proposal in a serious way. We hope that Russia is willing to do that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs you all know, the context of relations with Russia right now is fraught. It\u2019s one of the most difficult times that I think any of us have seen for a long time. If there is one issue, though, that I think is ripe to be solved, it could be this one, and we hope that Russia is willing to take those steps.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I will pause there, and turn it to our moderator to moderate questions, and I think we\u2019ve got about 20 minutes or so for questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Great, thank you, Ambassador. So I just want to remind everybody, please wait for the microphone before you ask your question because we are making a transcript. Also, for the same reason, please make sure to identify both your name and your outlet when you ask a question, and we may take some questions from our journalists in New York via the DVC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGreat. I think, Dmitry, you had your hand up first?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Dmitry Kirsanov of TASS. Mr. Ambassador, talking to reporters after your latest meeting with Vladislav Surkov in January, you sounded quite optimistic. And I\u2019m not trying to put any words into your mouth. If I may quote you, you said that \u201cthe Russian side was receptive\u201d to several key points you raised, that you heard some \u201cpositive reactions.\u201d And now you are saying, as far as I understand it, that essentially there was no \u2013 any further interaction with Surkov on that. I just wanted to ask you to clarify if a new meeting with your Russian counterpart has been set yet. That\u2019s point one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd secondly, could you clarify whether your appointment \u2013 and this is, I think, is flowing from a bit of a confusion based on your interview with Politico some time ago \u2013 whether your appointment was temporary or not? You said you\u2019re not drawing a salary as far as I understand. So it is a term appointment? Are you leaving anytime soon or not? Again, I\u2019m not trying to push you into that direction. Have you had any contacts with Secretary of State-designate Pompeo about that? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> So \u2013 yes, thank you. So first, as you said correctly, I thought that the discussions that we had in January were constructive, and at that time, my Russian counterpart undertook to put thoughts on paper and to come back to us when he was ready to seek a further meeting. That has not happened yet. And so I think all of us had some understanding that in the run-up to the Russian elections, and now with the installation of a new government still yet to come, understandable that there is some delay in this. But that is the state of play.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd yes, I did have a chance to discuss Ukraine with Secretary-designate Pompeo a couple of times, and he\u2019s quite satisfied with where we are at the moment. And concerning my own position, it is not a temporary position. It\u2019s one that I am doing on a voluntary basis while still doing other activities, and one that I\u2019m prepared to continue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Great. We\u2019ll go to \u2013 here and then we\u2019ll go to New York after that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hello, my name is Iaroslav Dovgopol. I\u2019m working with Ukrainian news agency UkrInform. My question is about the political situation. Recently, President Trump said on Twitter that U.S.-Russia relationship is worse now than it has ever been, even during the Cold War. How does it impact on your activity as to \u2013 on the prospect of further negotiations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the second question: Could you please detailize what about your contact with France and Germany? You just mentioned a couple words about it. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> Sure. Let me start with that and come back. So from the beginning, from when I was first appointed in July, and throughout the time period since then, we\u2019ve made a consistent and conscientious effort to stay very closely coordinated with France and Germany. We\u2019re not trying to substitute for the Normandy process, we\u2019re not trying to overtake it, and we\u2019re not trying to formally become a part of it. We want to be coherent and consistent and supportive of that process. The goal here is to see the Minsk agreements fully implemented, and if the U.S. engagement can be helpful to that, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPractically speaking, I\u2019ve had meetings with them in New York, in Paris, in Washington, in Berlin, we\u2019ve done secure video conferences, we\u2019ve done phone calls, we\u2019ve met in Munich. So we\u2019ve really worked at making sure we are in touch. In fact, I had a briefing with EU representatives earlier this week and specifically discussed again with France and Germany together where we are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s very important. The \u2013 President Trump has it exactly right, of course. We are at a low point in U.S.-Russia relations, and I don\u2019t think it is where anyone wants it to be. We would like to be in a better situation. But the facts are as they are, and a lot of that is due to Russia\u2019s own actions. It is concerning, because the risks of escalation are in front of us. We can see those risks, and it\u2019s not anything anyone wants. But it is important that we see some change in Russia\u2019s positions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs for how it affects my efforts, you know the full range of issues on which there are disagreements, including about Syria, about chemical weapons, about nuclear issues, about INF issues, about diplomatic personnel, and so forth. We also fundamentally have a different view over Russia\u2019s occupation of some of its neighboring countries. But this is one where, at least on paper, there is a basis on which we could potentially make progress. Russia, by signing the Minsk agreements, has affirmed Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It says that it wants to protect Russian-speaking people, and these are things that we completely agree on. We want to protect people, all people \u2013 Ukrainian, Tartar, Russian, whatever. And we do want to see the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. So if there is a way in which we can advance that and accomplish those objectives, then this might be an area where we could actually make progress.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>Okay, thank you. Let\u2019s go to New York. Please state your name and outlet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Hello, there. My name is Kateryna Lisunova, I\u2019m journalist of Ukrainian TV channel Pryamiy. I\u2019m working permanently in United Nations. So if coming back to peacekeepers, I have two questions. I was speaking with now the security \u2013 national security advisor of Trump, John Bolton. So he\u2019s absolutely against this idea of peacekeeper being mission in Ukraine. Have you been spoken with him about that already, and will it possibly have any problems with that if one of the administration of Trump having other vision of resolving this problem and it is not the peacekeeping mission?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the second question is, why exactly John Bolton thinking that peacekeeping mission is not the way to resolve the problem. He\u2019s telling that any kind of peacekeeping mission which will be good for Ukraine will be vetoed by Russians. So from that point, other more theoretical question is: Do you see in the future a possibility to remove the veto from Russians? Because there is some statements about that. There were statements about trying to do that from Poroshenko a few hours ago. So two questions about peacekeeping mission.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER: </b>Thank you. I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with John Bolton since he has become the national security advisor. It\u2019s only this week. I do agree with him that a number of UN peacekeeping missions have been very expensive, they\u2019ve gone on a long time, and they\u2019ve served to create a frozen conflict rather than to solve a conflict. So I think those are very valid concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhat we\u2019re talking about in the case of eastern Ukraine is somewhat different from that. This is \u2013 it would not be a traditional UN peacekeeping operation run through the UN system. It would be on the basis of voluntary contributions by nations, and it would only be there as a transition mechanism to go from the current situation of Russian control to a situation of Ukrainian control. And so it would be a transition mechanism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, you would only do this if Russia is in agreement. No one is suggesting that this is going to be imposed on anyone. Russia would need to see this as a constructive vehicle for implementing the Minsk agreements. So there\u2019s no \u2013 the idea of a Russian veto doesn\u2019t even come up, because we\u2019re not even going to be proposing it unless we\u2019re already in agreement with Russia. So I think it\u2019s a very different kind of peacekeeping arrangement that we\u2019re talking about.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR: </b>I saw Dmytri\u2019s hand a little while ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you very much. Dmytri Anopchenko, a Ukrainian reporter working here in Washington. Sir, two short questions please. Firstly, according to the information from Kyiv, you possibly will visit Ukraine at the end of April, beginning of May. Can you just share your plans? Can you just share the information about that visit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd secondly, we are still in the process of receiving the lethal arms from America. I know it\u2019s a road plan, I know it\u2019s a road map. So can you share on which stage are we right now? And do you have any concerns, or do you have any ideas how the receiving of these lethal weapons, speaking about the Javelins for example, will influence on your work on peace process? So do you expect any moves to better or worse?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER: </b>All right. So first off on plans, we\u2019ve been working the dates and it looks like it\u2019s going to be toward the middle of May, and I am planning both to visit the eastern part of Ukraine as well as Kyiv again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the support for Ukraine\u2019s defense capabilities, it\u2019s very important to keep this in the context that it is, which is Ukraine is having to defend itself on its own territory. Every day, there are weapons fired at Ukrainian forces inside Ukraine\u2019s own territory. They lose, on average, a soldier or two a week. This year \u2013 you have a handout somewhere that gives the exact numbers \u2013 but this year we\u2019ve seen well over a hundred Ukrainian soldiers killed. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 I believe the number is 28 civilians killed through this fighting. So this is a traumatic thing affecting a country, and it is perfectly legitimate for a country to seek to defend itself on its own territory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn that context, there are some gaps in Ukrainian defense capabilities, and we\u2019re very happy to try to help fill those gaps in its defenses. And there are some things where it\u2019s important to reinforce those defense capabilities so that the conflict doesn\u2019t get worse. And what I think the delivery of some of these defensive arms to Ukraine demonstrates is that the cost of escalating the conflict by Russia will only continue to grow. So it \u2013 we hope that that is clear to Russia that it\u2019s just not worth it, that escalating the conflict is not the direction to go in. We should be instead trying to end the conflict and bring about peace.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think having a stronger Ukrainian defensive capability helps in the process of then negotiating towards a final settlement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Oleg.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Oleg Merkulov, Vesti media group from Riga, Latvia. So the resistance in Donbas clearly could not go without the support of local population. So they must have had some concerns at the beginning of all these events. So what concerns do you think local population had at the beginning of events, and was not one of the concerns the status of Russian language in eastern Ukraine?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe reason for my question is that in Latvia, after the breakup of Soviet Union, everybody was promised equal rights and the status of languages, and right now Russian language is being basically outlawed and even the education in Russian language is being eliminated as we speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> So you are right to say that there were concerns by people in eastern Ukraine about the policies and politics in Kyiv, or differences prior to the war. That itself did not lead to a war \u2013 that there have been differences in the past, they\u2019ve been addressed politically. What happened, as we all recall, in early 2014, is that Russia put in intelligence forces, special forces, fomented insurrection, reinforced those with military equipment and military officers, and created a conflict. That is very different from having concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThose concerns are legitimate and still should be addressed. I think that there is a \u2013 there is a lot of context in Europe for protecting and preserving the rights of minorities. Language, education, identity, through the OSCE, through EU mechanisms, EU human rights \u2013 there\u2019s an established practice there. And that should be respected and implemented everywhere in Europe, and I would \u2013 and including in Ukraine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo there are issues to address. That is not a justification for conflict. It is not the origin or the source of the conflict. And the best way to get those addressed is to end the conflict, so that there can be a political reintegration of these territories and respect for those kinds of rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Great. There was a hand back here? Oh. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Oksana Bedratenko from Voice of America, Ukrainian Service. I wanted to ask: We have seen reports recently about the Russian tanks moving towards the eastern border of Ukraine. What do you make of these recent military moves?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd also the second question, if I might: The Georgian Government unveiled the new step for the future strategy on the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions. What is your opinion on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> Right. So let\u2019s start with Ukraine. We have seen over four years a steady Russian military support and leadership of the forces fighting in the east. And that has involved tanks, mortars, infantry, electronic warfare \u2013 everything you can imagine. And because this is over a four-year period, there has frequently been a need for changing out of troops and equipment. Rotations of forces, replacement of equipment, and so forth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t at this point believe there\u2019s anything dramatically new in what we\u2019re seeing from Russia. I don\u2019t think that the dynamics of the conflict have been significantly altered in the last three and a half years. That said, the fact of continued Russian military engagement and support in the east fighting against Ukrainian forces on Ukrainian territory is the entire problem that we\u2019re talking about here and what we hope to try to resolve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tConcerning Georgia\u2019s outreach, it\u2019s an interesting contrast, because I think that as we were saying with eastern Ukraine, the reaching out, the reconciliation, the inclusion, the respect for minorities, the respect for rights of people is a critical part of reintegration, and something that I think is important for Ukraine\u2019s future. And I think the Georgian Government, with its package of measures, seems to be trying to do that in similar cases where Russia has taken territory in Georgia, occupies that territory. In the case of \u2013 Georgia<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[*]</a> has also recognized these territories as independent states, something that very few others in the world would recognize. But it is an effort to try to enfranchise and reach and support the populations of these territories, because Georgia fundamentally continues to view them, as do all of we, as part of Georgia\u2019s sovereign territory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\u2019s a constructive step to work on those people-to-people connections. And frankly, let me just add too, always think of this from the perspective of the people living there. What is it that they can and can\u2019t do to \u2013 if you\u2019re living in eastern Ukraine, to collect your pension? You\u2019re entitled to a Ukrainian Government pension if you\u2019re a certain age. But the Ukrainian Government doesn\u2019t have the ability to distribute that to you, so you have to cross the line of conflict, or some other way travel to the rest of Ukrainian territory to collect it \u2013 a very dangerous thing to do and a very \u2013 a troubling thing to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou have \u2013 I saw a picture the other day in Georgia where the Russians have moved the practical line of control of South Ossetia so that a family can no longer reach the gravesite of one of their relatives. It\u2019s just on the other side of the fence. It\u2019s those sorts of things that are really \u2013 they\u2019re troubling really from a human point of view as to what people are having to live through there, and the best thing is to bring about peace and to try to support the reintegration of territory so people can live normal lives again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Do we have time for two more?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> Two more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay. Nikolay and then --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Ambassador Volker, we have the list of --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> I\u2019m sorry, could you \u2013 Nikolay, just state your name and outlet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Nikolay Zimin, Russian news agency Interfax. We have the list of the bad actions from the part of Russia. And what about the opposite side? Do you consider the Ukrainian approach to the conflict and the process as a impeccable, no mistakes from their part? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> Thank you. No, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s impeccable or no mistakes. In fact, we saw early on in the conflict the Ukrainian forces were rather disorganized, you saw some private militias, you saw some very bad behavior at that time. But what we\u2019ve seen over time, first off, all of this is taking place on Ukrainian territory. So Ukraine is acting inside its own borders to try to establish security and restore government control, as any country would do if it were defending its own territory.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe second is that the professionalism with which Ukraine is doing this has steadily increased since the worst days of 2014. We\u2019ve seen a tremendous improvement in the training of Ukrainian military forces, the integration of those forces, the command and control of those forces, and the conduct of those forces in the course of the conflict. So I would not say it\u2019s perfect, but I\u2019d say there has been tremendous progress and movement in the right direction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> Okay, we\u2019ll finish with Yana. Please state your name and outlet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yana Slyesarchuks, Ukrainian TV channel 1+1. Talking about situation in Syria, recent situation, expected U.S.-led strike on Syria. So many people in Ukraine and driven out are gravely concerned that this situation can have backlash on Ukraine. Do you have any thoughts and comments? How would you react if such a backlash could be, and what could be such a backlash?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR VOLKER:</b> I think the context overall is important, and as was pointed out earlier, the context now of relations with Russia is very fraught, very dangerous. And so that is something that we need to bear in mind. On the substance of it, however, I think these issues do stand on their own merits rather differently. We have some very grave issues to handle in Syria, and the risks there are very great. We also have the issues that we\u2019ve been talking about in Ukraine, but there is at least prospect there where you can see how we could agree, and if so, I think we should make every effort to do so. We are not there yet, and it could be that this context makes it difficult, but we have to keep the door open to be willing to try and willing to reach an agreement if possible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MODERATOR:</b> All right. Thank you so much, Ambassador. With that, we conclude the briefing, and we thank you so much for coming today.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[*]</a> Russia\n</p>\n\n</div>"

It\u2019s great to see you all. I hope everyone\u2019s doing all right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPARTMENT\"></a>A few announcements to start out today. First, I\u2019d like to start with recognizing all of you. As many of you journalists know today, today is the 25th anniversary of World Press Freedom Day. Journalists shine a light on many issues around the world, keeping citizens informed, prompting robust debate and discussion \u2013 we certainly face that here \u2013 and holding governments accountable. We honor the many journalists and media professionals who have dedicated their lives to the profession. We see all too often that journalists continue to take great risks to pursue this important work. We saw this earlier this week, certainly, in Afghanistan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJournalists have been detained for their reporting in Burma, Cuba, Egypt, Turkey, and in China. The family members of Uighur journalists have been detained as a result of their relatives reporting on China\u2019s widespread crackdown of Uighurs and other Muslims. Authorities have shut down or have attempted to shut down media outlets critical of the respective governments in Tanzania, in Cambodia, in the Philippines, and many other places as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn mid-April, the Nicaraguan Government ordered five television stations off the air during nationwide protests, and many journalists continue to be threatened, censored, or intimidated. We urge accountability for the murder of journalists in Malta, Mexico, Russia, and Slovakia, and the apparent assassination of a BBC Pashto reporter in Afghanistan on Monday. We are also outraged by Monday\u2019s savage attack in Kabul claimed by ISIS that killed nine journalists and media professionals, including some, I know, from some of your organizations and from Radio Free Europe as well. We want to express our deepest condolences and sympathy for the loss of those brave reporters.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile these examples clearly demonstrate that the safety and independence of journalists and media outlets remains precarious in many environments, we\u2019d also like to underscore the vital importance of credible news reporting to free and open democratic societies. Censorship and disinformation are common tactics for eroding press freedom, and we encourage people in all regions of the world to think critically about their sources of news and information.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEarlier this morning, the department hosted an interactive web chat to discuss the importance of media literacy in today\u2019s evolving news and information landscape. Healthy and robust public debates based on facts, evidence, and reason are integral to civic engagement. With on-camera participation from a viewing group in Nairobi and more than 30 other viewing groups at posts around the world, the panelists highlighted ways that educators and students can develop their skills in analyzing and understanding the credibility and the biases of media sources. You can review the discussion at our DRL, at our Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor\u2019s Facebook page at State DRL.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"GEORGIA\"></a>Next, I\u2019d like to discuss our Assistant Secretary Wess Mitchell\u2019s travel to Georgia and Ukraine. Today, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Wess Mitchell is wrapping up his travel to Georgia and Ukraine. While in Tblisi from April 29th to May the 1st, he met with senior Georgian officials, including the president and the prime minister, to talk about our strong bilateral relationship and Georgia\u2019s democratic and economic reforms. He reaffirmed the United States support for Georgia\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity with its \u2013 in its internationally recognized borders. He also reiterated that the United States stands by NATO\u2019s 2008 Bucharest Declaration that Georgia will become a member of NATO. He also visited the administrative boundary line with the Russian-occupied Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where are currently occupied by Russian forces in violation of the 2008 ceasefire agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn May 2nd, secretary \u2013 Assistant Secretary Mitchell arrived in Kyiv, where he met with President Poroshenko, the prime minister, and other senior Ukrainian leaders. The assistant secretary affirmed our unbending support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. He emphasized the importance of Ukraine adhering to the conditions of the IMF loan package that includes establishing a credible anticorruption court in line with the Venice Commission recommendations. He also announced an additional 5 million in cyber security assistance for Ukraine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, Assistant Secretary Mitchell reaffirmed our commitment to supporting Ukraine as it continues on the path to NATO and Euro-Atlantic integration, including the importance of adopting an appropriate law on national security.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPARTMENT2\"></a>Just a couple more. Next, I would like to highlight one of our colleagues here, and that is Felicia Schwartz. Felicia is a tremendous journalist with <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. I say that not for your benefit, but her parents or her grandparents may be watching today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFelicia, we are so excited for your new opportunity when you\u2019ll be going to Tel Aviv to be the bureau chief for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. That is not an insignificant job, as you well know, and I just want to say how proud we are of you for doing that. You are an excellent reporter, you are a tough reporter, you are a fair reporter, and you\u2019ve been a joy to work with.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAbout six weeks ago I got a call from Felicia. I was overseas somewhere, and it was the first hint that there might be something going on here at the State Department. Her sources are excellent. Congratulations to you, Felicia. We\u2019ll certainly miss you and look forward to your next person coming in. Big shoes to fill. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTwo more personnel things. And Michelle, I\u2019d like to say congratulations on Best Dressed at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. (Laughter.) She had a beautiful yellow dress that was really stunning, so I\u2019d like to highlight that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLastly, we have a real personnel announcement here at the State Department, and I would like to announce that we are pleased to announce the acknowledgment and the arrival of Mr. Ulrich Brechbuhl, who will be serving as counselor to the State Department. Mr. Brechbuhl joins the department after having recently served as president of Appenseller Point \u2013 it\u2019s a family investing and consulting business \u2013 and executive chairman of Avadyne Health. Mr. Brechbuhl began his career in public service as a student at the United States Military Academy \u2013 West Point \u2013 where he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree with Highest Distinction. During his six and a half years of active duty with the Army, her served as a cavalry officer, he worked on a wide range of assignments, including leading troops patrolling the Iron Curtain with the 2nd Cavalry and served as a general\u2019s aide and working as an operations officer during the Persian Gulf War.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI had a chance to meet him the other day and spent a little bit of time with him earlier today. Part of what he will be doing here at the State Department is helping our new Secretary, Secretary Pompeo, get our team staffed up. The Secretary has acknowledged and highlighted the importance of filling vacant positions. As many of you know, we have a lot of them, and so he will be working very hard in filling up those positions. As the Secretary would say, we\u2019re planning to get our team on the field.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thanks, Heather. Just one quick one on World Press Freedom Day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"PALESTINIANS\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> And then I want to talk about North Korea. You mentioned the deaths of journalists in Russia, Malta, Slovakia, of course Kabul. Would you also condemn the recent deaths of journalists, Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah. I mean look, there are, unfortunately, a lot of journalists who die all around the world. I\u2019m not going to be able to list every single death of a journalist around the world, although that is certainly important and significant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of what you\u2019re referring to, we are always saddened by the loss of life. I want to highlight that: We are always saddened by the loss of life. In terms of Israel, we would say the bigger issue is that the violence has to stop, and we understand that Israel has a right to defend itself. We are very firm here at the State Department and others in the administration about the right and the importance of a free press.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But you do acknowledge that these guys were reporting the news; they were not threatening the Israeli soldiers in any way, shape, or form?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And they were --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have all the details on an investigation, but I will say we always are saddened by the loss of life and that Israel does have a right to defend itself. They are conducting an investigation. I am not going to speak to that investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. There are also \u2013 they also wounded four. There are 17 Palestinians in prison today as we speak. Would you call on the Israelis to let them go --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I do not have information about all of the specific cases. There are --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Would you \u2013 could you find \u2013 could you find out if we could --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I will see what I can find out for you, Said. But when there are cases that we are very familiar with, such as reporters who were detained in Burma, for example, when I do have specific information on people\u2019s cases and we can speak about it, I\u2019m certainly happy to do so. I think you know that very well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But you do recognize that they were willfully killed by the Israelis, right, the two journalists?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Said, I don\u2019t have any information on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Could you find out, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have any information on that. I would refer you to the Government of Israel on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI meant actually to go to Felicia for the first question today. My apologies, Josh. But Felicia, if you have a question, I\u2019ll go to you after Josh and I finish up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"NORTHKOREA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Well, I assume my North Korea question is the same as Josh\u2019s, which is: What can you say? There\u2019s been a lot of information swirling about the fate of the three Americans who are being held.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Sure. We\u2019ve certainly been following their cases for quite some time. You and I and we all spent a lot of time in this room talking about the case of Otto Warmbier certainly last year. In terms of the reports \u2013 and there have been a ton of media reports; I\u2019ve gotten so many calls and questions from all of you \u2013 I can just say we can\u2019t confirm the validity of those reports at this point. As you all know, the safety and the welfare of U.S. citizens abroad is our top issue. We want to see our American citizens brought home. We have been asking that and we\u2019ve been calling on that \u2013 the North Korean Government for that for quite some time. We want them to come home as soon as possible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Do you know if --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is this --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is it the \u2013 I know that you don\u2019t know if they were going to be released.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But as far as them being moved out of a prison into a hotel, is that information the U.S. has --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I just can\u2019t confirm anything on that at this point. I don\u2019t have any information on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And then can you tell us when Mayor Giuliani, who is now \u2013 works for President Trump, is talking about this on television, is he speaking on behalf of the U.S. Government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I would just have to refer you to the White House on that, because I\u2019ve not spoken with Mayor Giuliani about his role or his comments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But in general, I mean, if in the future he appears on television and he makes comments about a major foreign policy issue, whether it be North Korea or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Josh, I would say that\u2019s a hypothetical.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, it\u2019s not really, because it happened last night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>No, but you said if he does in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Should we take that as a position --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>That\u2019s why I would say it\u2019s a hypothetical, okay? I don\u2019t have any information about what exactly his role is going to be, other than being a legal advisor to the President. So I\u2019d just have to refer you to the White House on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And the fact that we started hearing these reports about the detainees \u2013 I think it\u2019s been more than 24 hours now, so given that there has been so much communication and seemingly goodwill leading up to a summit, does the fact that we don\u2019t really know if these reports are even true at this point say anything about the level and efficacy of communication between the U.S. and North Korea at this point?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Michelle, I can just say we can\u2019t confirm at this time the validity of those reports. We certainly think it would be a very good sign if North Korea \u2013 and a wonderful gesture of goodwill \u2013 if North Korea were to release our three Americans who\u2019ve been detained there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So is communication really not working between these two countries at this point?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Michelle, I just can say that I can\u2019t confirm the validity of those reports.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The President in his tweets seems to be more optimistic, seems to have more information. Do you share this optimism about the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think we\u2019re always cautiously optimistic when dealing with certain countries. North Korea would certainly --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Including on the detainees?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>North Korea would certainly be one of them. This is obviously a priority for this administration. A week into the President\u2019s term in office, he turned to our previous secretary of state and said, \u201cBring home Americans who are being held overseas.\u201d The secretary, the President, the entire administration through the interagency worked on that very hard, and we\u2019ve had some real successes in bringing home Americans who\u2019ve been detained in Egypt and in elsewhere. This still continues to be a tremendous priority for the President and for Secretary Pompeo as well. I can\u2019t comment further on the status of things. I can just say it would be a great step in the right direction for our people to be brought home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t have any sign that this is going on?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Pardon me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t have any signs that this is going in the right direction?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t have any additional information on that, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Hey, Janne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, are you aware of the video of the Iranian foreign minister in which he says they won\u2019t be renegotiating --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We\u2019ll come back. Let\u2019s finish up anything on North Korea before we come back to Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi. Go ahead. Hi, Janne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Otto Warmbier\u2019s father and his family filed a complaint against the North Korea in federal district court, I think last week. What is the comment you --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I mean, I can share with you that I know Otto Warmbier\u2019s family is in a tremendous amount of pain. How could you not be? The loss of your son in such a brutal fashion. My understanding is that his family is meeting with Ambassador Haley today in New York, I believe. I think they met just a few hours ago. I have not been a part of those conversations so I\u2019d have to refer you to USUN for additional information on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that there was a follow-on meeting between the Japanese, the United States, and others, where they were talking about abductions in a general sense regarding North Korea. But that is all I have for you. I\u2019ve not spoken with the Warmbier family.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> President Trump at the table \u2013 he going to mention about it, Warmbier\u2019s issues or the human right abuse issues, at the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the President and what he intends to discuss with the North Koreans. I can tell you that human rights abuses \u2013 that is an issue that we always bring up with countries who are abusing human rights. You may recall a few weeks ago we released our Human Rights Report, and we were very clear in our description of North Korea and other countries, and we\u2019ve certainly not backed away from that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Anything else related to North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. So not on detainees, but \u2013 so at the Inter-Korean Summit, both Moon and Kim said that they want to make an effort to end the Korean war. So what\u2019s the U.S. position on that? And then if, like, a peace treaty comes to happen, what is the position? Like what change, if any, will happen with U.S. troops in ROK and Japan?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I think we covered this about a week and a half ago, when I was last briefing you all here in this room. And it would certainly be a wonderful thing to have the war formally brought to an end. That\u2019s something that the President has said that he firmly supports. We would certainly support that as well. In terms of U.S. troop presence, I guess I\u2019d refer you to President Moon\u2019s comments from yesterday, or perhaps it was earlier today, which he said the U.S. military presence in South Korea is a matter of the U.S.-Korea alliance. It has no relevance to any peace treaty. Beyond that, I\u2019d just have to refer you to the Department of Defense for any discussions about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, one more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Last one.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Secretary Pompeo yesterday during swearing-in ceremony said that he seeks permanent, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s WMD. He actually said this several times during his nomination hearing, when he was in Jordan with the Japanese foreign minister. So this is quite different from the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement, so is this a higher bar for North Korea, or is it essentially the same?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We\u2019re calling it CVID now. So because the State Department, the government likes acronyms so much, we\u2019ve got a new one: CVID \u2013 complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. That is our policy and that is the policy of Secretary Pompeo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Let\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Wouldn\u2019t that be PVID? You add another addition of PVID.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, I don\u2019t have anything on that for you. I don\u2019t have anything on that for you today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t have \u2013 what\u2019s the difference, CVID and PVID? Permanently --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think our government policy has been very well known and explained a lot of times on how we are approaching negotiations with North Korea, the importance of that. Look, we would not be at this place where we are today without the maximum pressure campaign. If anything, if there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve spoken more about our maximum pressure campaign than anything else in the past year-plus since I\u2019ve been doing this job.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> PVID means permanently --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We are seeing tremendous progress. We\u2019ve gotten to this point where we can sit down and have conversations \u2013 we certainly hope and are looking forward to it \u2013 between the President of the United States and Kim Jong-un. And we are looking forward to what they have pledged, which is exactly that, denuclearization. Let\u2019s move on to something else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Sorry, one more on --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Hi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"TURKEY\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. On Turkey, Turkey\u2019s carrying out ethnic cleansing in Afrin, replacing the Kurdish population, much of which fled when Turkey attacked, and now they\u2019re not allowed back to their homes. They\u2019re being replaced with Arabs, who are themselves displaced from Ghouta and elsewhere. What\u2019s your comment on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. Laurie, we\u2019ve been watching this situation very carefully in Afrin. We spent a lot of time covering this about a month or two ago, as you well know. 140,000 people have been displaced from Afrin, and as we can tell \u2013 as far as we can tell, they are not being allowed back in to their homes and communities. We have expressed grave concern about the humanitarian situation in Afrin over recent weeks and months. That remains a concern of ours today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe call on all relevant sides, all relevant actors operating in the northwest \u2013 that includes Turkey, that includes Russia, that also includes Syria \u2013 to provide access for international humanitarian aid organizations and to allow for people to come home. When people go home \u2013 and this is something we always find important to highlight, is that it needs to be safe and it needs to be voluntary. They can\u2019t be forced back in their homes, but we would like for them to be brought home or to be able to head home safely and as soon as possible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Secretary Pompeo is to meet the Turkish foreign minister shortly. Do you think this will be an issue when the two men meet?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I can tell you we have a lot of things to discuss with the Turkish foreign minister. As you know, they just met at NATO less than a week ago, where they had conversations about a wide range of issues. We have a lot of things to discuss with them, NATO-related and otherwise, so I imagine that that could be a part of the conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Turkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Hey. Hi, Ilhan. How are you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much. Today, as you mentioned in the beginning, World Press Freedom Day, and you have been talking about Turkey due to severe conditions in the press freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Today, Amnesty International launch a new campaign for Turkey. Turkey is still the country, most jails \u2013 most journalists jailed in a country in the worldwide. My question is, first of all, do you join Amnesty International for this campaign to say free Turkey media?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I think our position on the importance of a free press is very well known. In countries it is particularly important for people to be able to speak their minds. When they speak their minds, they may not always be agreeing with the government, but that is certainly no reason for a government to throw somebody in jail or a journalist in jail. You\u2019re absolutely right, there are more journalists jailed in Turkey than in any other country around the world. That is a tremendous concern. We believe that more voices rather than fewer voices being heard helps advance a democratic society and helps give people voice to their concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe support the goal of improved media freedom in Turkey; we\u2019ve discussed that a lot here at the State Department. We raise the issue \u2013 I want to tell you \u2013 directly with the Turkish Government on many occasions. We continue to highlight that. We also do it not only face to face with our counterparts but also through various multilateral institutions. So thank you for highlighting that, and we\u2019ll continue to raise our concerns with press freedom in Turkey and elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. One more question on Turkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Mm-hmm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Last week, three senators proposed a bill to block F-35 fighter jets to Turkey due to some of the American citizens have been arrested in Turkey, but there are other conditions as well such as S-400 air defense system from Russia. Do you agree with this bill? Are you going to support this bill?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, as a matter of course, we don\u2019t comment on pending legislation with Congress, but I can tell you that we have had serious concerns about Turkey\u2019s potential acquisition of the S-400 system. Under NATO and under the NATO agreement, which of course, Turkey is a NATO member, you\u2019re only supposed to buy, they are only supposed to buy, weapons and other materiel that are interoperable with other NATO partners. We don\u2019t see that as being interoperable. We obviously, though, have a robust defense trade relationship with the Government of Turkey, and we will continue to raise our concerns with them on any kind of pending sales or anything of that nature.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What is the cutoff for when a pending sale falls under that or not? For instance, the Turks have been saying, well, before this CAATSA kicked in, we had this already kind of locked in place and so it\u2019s grandfathered in. Is that consistent with the U.S. --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, that doesn\u2019t \u2013 this, what we\u2019re talking about now, doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with CAATSA. CAATSA is certainly a part of it, but the interoperability is something that long predated CAATSA because that\u2019s a NATO agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Sure. We don\u2019t sanction people for interoperability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We\u2019re sanctioning people for violating CAATSA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And we have had many conversations with our partners around the world \u2013 Turkey being one of them; there are a lot of other governments that I could cite as well \u2013 where we are speaking to them about CAATSA and the restrictions under CAATSA, and if you run afoul against CAATSA what exactly is at stake. So that would be --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But this is a gray area here where nobody knows whether those restrictions apply to deals that were already kind of in the works.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have any information for you on that. If I can get something from our Pol-Mil people, I\u2019ll certainly look into it and see what I can bring to you. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right. Hey, Michelle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPARTMENT3\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Just based on a couple of things that you said prior on staffing and wanting to staff things up under Pompeo, what is the latest thinking on filling Joseph Yun\u2019s position?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That is not a question that I\u2019ve asked the Secretary. I know we\u2019re in solid hands. We have \u2013 a lot of great people are assisting here, but his first day really in the building was just two days ago. So these are the things that I know people will be bringing to his attention. I\u2019m sure he is well aware that that position exists. He is going to spend time \u2013 and in fact, he\u2019s already started interviewing people here at the State Department for various positions. He shared with me this morning that he intends to interview people throughout the weekend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo this is a priority of his. He said that in his hearings on Capitol Hill, he said that to us privately, and I know he\u2019s alluded that to all of you publicly as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> In the past two days, he\u2019s already done interviews? Or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> He\u2019s been talking to people already. Yes, he has. Yes, he is.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Do you know how many or what positions they --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can\u2019t say how many or characterize or what positions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Some of these will just be private conversations. But it\u2019s something that is important to him --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- and he understands and recognizes the need to have not only our people hard at work, but to have our people well \u2013 to have our department well-staffed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can you --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you had a whole lot to say about press freedom, basically speaking to the world on that. So when the President of the United States and those around him repeatedly say the words \u201cfake news,\u201d isn\u2019t that disinformation?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, we\u2019ve discussed this as well. You and I have had many exchanges on this, and that\u2019s part of what the beauty of a free press and the beauty of a First Amendment when people can say what they want. You don\u2019t have to agree with it, others don\u2019t have to agree with it, but that is certainly within his own right to do so. When we look at the absence of a free press in other countries, we look at what those countries are doing to journalists, and that\u2019s something that we do not see here in the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Turkey, for example, some of our \u2013 some of your colleagues here, if they were to head home to Turkey, they would be arrested. Why? In part, because of the job that they are doing each and every day. One of your other colleagues from Afghanistan, if she were to return home, she would once again, without a doubt, be subject to harassment, death threats, and the like because her family\u2019s been threatened before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So because that\u2019s not happening here, the White House lying and saying \u201cfake news\u201d is a better deal?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Michelle, I\u2019m not going to get into this. Look, it\u2019s the right of the free press, and it\u2019s the President, and he has the right to speak his mind and has a right to be concerned about stories that he feels are inaccurate. Okay? I\u2019ll leave it at that. I will refer you to the White House beyond that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hey, Lesley.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I \u2013 can you just give us a kind of flavor of what the Secretary\u2019s been up to the last 24 hours?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Since you saw him last?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, right. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Let\u2019s see, you saw him last on Monday night. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Did he have a meeting today with senior State Department officials --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>He did, yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>So give us just some kind of a flavor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Sure. So I don\u2019t know what time the secretary walked in the building, but as an Army guy and a former West Pointer, I\u2019m pretty sure it was pretty early in the morning. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t make us go on a PT run or any of that, so \u2013 but I do know he\u2019s hard at work. He had a meeting with senior staff this morning in which he was really in listen mode, and that\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019ve learned about him since having traveled with him last week, and you and some of our \u2013 your other colleagues as well. He listens; he asks questions and then he listens. He wants to learn from us, and he cites this old story years ago where somebody said to him, early on in his military career, \u201cYou would be well served to just shut up and listen.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re finding right now. He\u2019s asked me a lot of questions; he\u2019s asked my colleagues a lot of questions, which is such a terrific sign, when somebody wants to hear form the experts in the building or the people who are currently doing their jobs what is working well, what isn\u2019t working well, and what can we do better. So he\u2019s having lots of conversations with people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Can you also give a sense on \u2013 you said he\u2019s doing a lot of interviews. Where is he looking to fill first and quickly?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS HOLMES: </b>I haven\u2019t asked him his priority on which positions he wants to fill first. Obviously, senior staff is something that is important, but all kinds of jobs here are important at the State Department, so I know he\u2019ll be looking at filling those as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>What about ambassadorships, Heather? Is he meeting with the President already to talk about ambassadorships? Will he, do you expect, have a greater role than Secretary Tillerson in kind of identifying candidates for the President?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, I would say without a doubt. As we all saw yesterday and the day before, the fact that the President came in here at the State Department for the first time since he was elected to office is significant. It shows the strength and the trust between the President and also our new Secretary of State. Secretary Pompeo has said that he wants to fill these positions. He recognizes the importance of filling \u2013 whether it\u2019s State Department staff or our ambassador posts. I think that\u2019s why you saw some of the news coming out over the past week about people being nominated to certain posts that had been not \u2013 had not been filled previously. So I expect \u2013 and he has said to the Senate, look, I\u2019m going to bringing a lot of people before you, and I take him at his word.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>And then one other \u2013 he had breakfast this morning with Secretary Mattis and John Bolton. I know Secretary Tillerson met with Mattis for breakfast very frequently. Do you expect that the three men will kind of make this a regular configuration in terms of meeting and kind of hashing out foreign policy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I would anticipate that that would be the case, yeah, that we would have more regular meetings with the Secretary\u2019s colleagues at the NSC and elsewhere.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Quick question, Heather --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>All right, go ahead. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Are the negotiations between E3 and you and the U.S., the State Department, still going on? One week to go before the decision the President has to make.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, those --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Those \u2013 go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>There\u2019s a meeting planned before May 12th and \u2013 or is already the Secretary presenting the President with these options?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, I can tell you that the Secretary and the President have had a lot of conversations about this topic in general. Some of these conversations I believe predate the Secretary\u2019s position here at the State Department because of the nature of national security issues. So he\u2019s very well steeped in the details of Iran. We continue \u2013 the State Department does \u2013 continues to have talk with some \u2013 talks with our E3 members about our concerns with the JCPOA. I don\u2019t have any specific details for you, but I can just tell you those conversations are happening very \u2013 happening very often.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFelicia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Follow-up?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>One more on Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>It\u2019s quite technical if the President decides to leave on May 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the first part?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>It\u2019s quite technical, like, the sanctions regime, putting it back in place. I\u2019m not asking you to prejudge the President\u2019s decision, but since he\u2019s left it open as a possibility that he would leave the deal, have you or people in this building been traveling \u2013 well, I don\u2019t think you would travel to do this, but have people in this building been traveling to brief officials in Russia and China and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Ye of little faith. Come on, you think I\u2019m not traveling to talk about the JCPOA? I\u2019m teasing; I\u2019m not the technical expert, you\u2019re absolutely right about that. I can tell you we\u2019ve had a lot of talks. Brian Hook, on the last trip, traveling over when he was in Brussels, had conversations with his counterparts and colleagues, with other countries, talking about our concerns. And our concerns are very well known about the JCPOA. I know he\u2019s talked about a range of options that are on the table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>But are your concerns just like some of the technical \u2013 like, in 2012 when they instituted this same sanctions regime that the President could snap back into place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>(Inaudible) air travel --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have any information \u2013 I wasn\u2019t present for those meetings, so I don\u2019t have any information about everything that was discussed, but I can tell you overall, our concerns regarding the JCPOA have been addressed significantly, and we\u2019ve also looked at ways of strengthening the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I just \u2013 do our allies understand how their \u2013 the businesses and banks in their countries might be affected?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I believe so. I believe so. I think we\u2019ve been clear about the ramifications and how things would work in that nature. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A follow-up on --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, Conor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A follow-up on something you just said, that your concerns have been addressed significantly: You mean, like, they\u2019ve been heard or things have been changed to address --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> They\u2019ve been heard.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Sorry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We\u2019ve addressed those concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A follow-up on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. All right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I had questions on Ukraine if we can --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I have --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m sorry, Conor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"UKRAINE\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> I have a question on Ukraine if we can --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Oh, sure. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So a member of parliament there and the special corruption prosecutor both confirmed to <i>The New York Times</i> the four investigations involving President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort have been halted. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to speak to that. Did anyone from the U.S. encourage or ask the Ukrainian Government to halt those investigations?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can tell you in terms of Ukraine, I can speak to the sale and I know a lot of you have been very interested in the sale of Javelin missiles to Ukraine. I can tell you that that was something that was on the table for a very long time before we announced back in 2017 that the President decided to provide the Javelin missile systems to Ukraine. Those were delivered just a few weeks ago. Somehow a bunch of you missed it that those were actually delivered. So somebody did a good job of keeping that quiet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut regarding the special counsel\u2019s investigation, I don\u2019t have anything for you on that. I\u2019m not going to comment on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But \u2013 so you\u2019re not denying it or confirming it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> No, I cannot comment on anything regarding that investigation. I\u2019d have to refer you to the White House for that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You mentioned, though, encouraging Ukraine to set up this special corruption \u2013 anti-corruption court.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Would you encourage them to pursue these cases?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t know the details of all of these cases, but we have very frequent conversations with the Ukrainian Government. As I noted at the top, our Assistant Secretary Wess Mitchell was just there yesterday or the day before yesterday, I believe it was. And so we have a lot of conversations with them about our concerns, about corruption and other matters, and we make our points very clear with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso I should add that our then-Acting Secretary John Sullivan at the G7 in Toronto, he had conversations with the Ukrainian Government as well expressing our concerns, and that\u2019s all I have on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi. How are you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I ask --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Nice to see you again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPARTMENT4\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible.) Thank you so much. You had a statement yesterday that the Department of State is establishing a Global Engagement Center technology series regarding foreign propaganda.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Correct.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And I wanted to know why in your statement you didn\u2019t mention any country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> In the statement we didn\u2019t mention any country? I think that\u2019s because it is so pervasive. A big part of our conversations at NATO included talks about state-sponsored propaganda and state-sponsored disinformation. Unfortunately, there are far too many countries that participate in that, and in speaking with our allies, we were able to have conversations where we are all on the same page expressing our deep concerns about Russian disinformation, disinformation from other parts of the world. We certainly see that. I know you\u2019re particularly interested in Cuba. Cuba, we see that happening as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe didn\u2019t mention any particular countries. We just didn\u2019t happen to do it. But we have a lot of conversations internally in the building about that very matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Will further meetings be taking place here in the State Department in this regard with other experts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Regarding just disinformation in general?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes. In fact, I have quite a few meetings scheduled on that very subject. I\u2019ve had two meetings yesterday on that subject alone. It was also included, let me mention, in the G7 communique, the communique that came out of the G7, where the countries all agreed to work on state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda and how we could best form I\u2019ll just call it a channel, so to speak, where we can best communicate best practices and ways that we can combat that. We\u2019ve seen that be a tremendous problem in countries all around the world. We know that the news out of Mexico today, for example, with people pushing out disinformation. So we continue to highlight those concerns, and certainly, our allies and partners are well aware of the fact that this exists.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. And I\u2019m going to have to wrap it up in \u2013 I\u2019m going to have to wrap it up in just a few minutes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I ask on (inaudible)?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible) to one more question on Iran because --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Sure.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAN\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> -- Iran foreign minister said Iran will not renegotiate the nuclear deal. So is there any comments from this podium?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m sorry. What was the last part of your question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Iran will not renegotiate the nuclear deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have any comments on --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, I think that\u2019s a hypothetical at this point. Some might consider it to be bluster. I\u2019m just not going to comment on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> On Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Question Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, go ahead. Last question on Iraq. Go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you. So some of the minority groups in Iraq are concerned about some political parties calling for majoritarian rule in Iraq, and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Calling for what rule?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>A majoritarian rule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Excluding the Kurds and the Sunnis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I see.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Do you have a comment on that? And then I have a follow-up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. First, what I\u2019d like to say about Iraq is congratulations on the election that they are holding. May 12th \u2013 so that would be nine day or so from now \u2013 their parliamentary directions. And what is incredible about the fact that they\u2019re holding that elections, they have 320 parliamentary seats, 7,000 candidates. I mean, imagine that. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a tremendous number, 50 parties. So I think we\u2019ve just seen such incredible success with the march toward democracy in Iraq. That specific \u2013 your specific question, I don\u2019t have any information for you on that, but I just overall want to applaud Iraqi leaders for taking part in getting them to this point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Well, thank you. But about the parties and the candidates, a lot of them are not able to campaign for their candidacy in disputed areas, where U.S. has called for a joint governance in the area, but that\u2019s not happening. And it\u2019s under some sort of military rule now, and parties are boycotting, and ISIS is reappearing. Are you in any talks with Iraq or the government in Erbil for some sort of negotiated joint governance in that area?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We have a lot of conversations with the Iraqi Government. They\u2019re a steadfast partner of the United States. In terms of specific conversations about your questions, I don\u2019t have any information for you on that. I can tell you more broadly that, with regard to the election, some of our various programs at DRL \u2013 one of our bureaus here, Democracy, Labor and Human Rights \u2013 they\u2019re partnering with the National Democratic Institute to implement a $3 million program that aims at \u2013 aimed at strengthening government \u2013 governance over all, and then boosting voter participation. USAID also has some separate programs through the Independent High Electoral Commission to try to ensure that all Iraqis \u2013 women, minority groups, and the like \u2013 all have access to the polls and to elections. If you\u2019d like any more information on that, I\u2019d be more than happy to get that to you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>But generally \u2013 the disputed areas, generally, they\u2019re supposed to be governed together with other groups, and they are not. Do you have --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I would have to look into that; I don\u2019t have that level of detail on the subject, okay. I\u2019d have to look into that and back with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Getting back --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>All right. We got to go. Thanks, everybody.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you, Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(The briefing was concluded at 3:38 p.m.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDPB # 26\n</p>\n\n</div>"

How is everyone today? Good. First, I\u2019d like to start out by welcoming some guests that we have in the back of the room. We have nine journalists who are visiting from Ecuador, so I\u2019d like to say welcome. We have a lot of journalists up here. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be happy to chat with you a little bit afterwards about some of the challenges in the United States, and likewise I\u2019m sure you have some as well that you could talk about in terms of reporting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGood afternoon, everyone. First, I want to start out with some personnel updates that we have here to announce at the State Department. I\u2019d like to take a moment to recognize some of the new people who have just been recently confirmed by the U.S. Senate. First, we have a new under secretary, Andrea Thompson. She is our new Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. Under Secretary Thompson is a former military officer who recently served as special advisor in the Office of Policy Planning at the State Department. She also served as deputy assistant to the President and national security advisor to the Vice President of the White House. And I should say, because Robert Greenan is from South Dakota, she\u2019s also from South Dakota. So we\u2019re thrilled to have her on board.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yay South Dakota.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Exactly, yay South Dakota. In addition to that, we have a few new assistant secretaries. Yleem Poblete is one of them; she\u2019s the Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance. Also Kirsten Madison is an Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Her first day in the building was just yesterday, so it was great to meet her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA few details about some of our new colleagues: The Assistant Secretary Poblete recently served as a senior advisor at the State Department. She also served for more than two decades on the staff of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at the House of Representatives, including as chief of staff and staff director \u2013 the first Hispanic female to serve in that post. Assistant Secretary Madison had been deputy director and resident fellow for foreign defense policy at American Enterprise Institute. She had a 25-year career in foreign and national security policy. She\u2019s worked on issues related to governance and counternarcotics for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the Coast Guard, the State Department, and she is now at the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary has said that the department\u2019s workforce is our most valuable asset. Those officials, along with many others, are hard at work to execute our mission of diplomacy and development on behalf of the State Department and the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen by now also that the Secretary made the decision and sent out a note today announcing the end of the hiring freeze. So we\u2019re tremendously happy in the building as a result of that today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to that, I would like to recognize Peace Officers Memorial Day. As many of you are aware, flags at the Department of State are at half-staff today, by presidential proclamation, to recognize Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week. We were especially humbled to honor those U.S. and partner nation law enforcement professionals who\u2019ve made the ultimate sacrifice to protect American diplomacy around the world. Here at the department we remember our four Diplomatic Security special agents who have given their lives protecting diplomacy, as well as their 140 colleagues from around the globe who\u2019ve died in service to Diplomatic Security. They are honored at the DSS Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs for the U.S. state and local police honored during National Police Week, those officers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to pursue justice across our nation, and we at the State Department are fortunate to be able to call quite a few of them and their police organizations our partners. Through 22 formal police department partnerships with the department managed by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, we leverage world-class expertise of U.S. police to build foreign nations\u2019 ability to fight crime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust this month, through the State Department partnerships, Miami-Dade police are now training Mexican counterparts in Miami, the Texas Department of Public Safety is conducting a field officer training in Morocco, and the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office hosted Haitian law enforcement for training there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis Peace Officers Memorial Day we reflect upon the men and women who protect us and who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Their watch may have not ended, but our gratitude for their service will not.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd lastly, I\u2019d like to mention that our USAID administrator, Mark Green, is visiting Cox\u2019s Bazar in Bangladesh on a USAID trip. He announced today more than 44 million in new humanitarian assistance to support Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and other vulnerable groups affected by the conflict in <a name=\"BURMA\"></a>Burma. This now brings the total U.S. humanitarian assistance for displaced people in and from Burma to more than 299 million since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2017. The new funding will provide emergency food and nutrition as well as shelter, safe drinking water, life-saving medical care, and other critical aid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, Administrator Green met with representatives from UNHCR, the World Food Program, and with newly arrived refugees who are now among the 700,000 Rohingya who have fled violence and conflict in Burma\u2019s Rakhine State since August, and they\u2019ve crossed the border into Bangladesh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States calls on the Government of Burma to allow for immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to reach people in need and create conditions that would allow for the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of those refugees.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLater this week, Administrator Green will be here \u2013 will be in Burma on behalf of Secretary Pompeo. He will meet with the governor of Burma \u2013 Burmese officials to discuss urgent steps needed to end the crisis in the Rakhine State and address violence in other parts of the country. And I know the Secretary looks forward to speaking with him when he gets back to get a full report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thanks, Heather. Before you get a barrage of questions about this latest \u2013 these reports coming out of <a name=\"NORTHKOREA\"></a>North Korea, I want to start \u2013 to which I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have an answer, other than we\u2019ve seen the report and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, that\u2019s your preface always. Yes, okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, I just suspect that it\u2019s going to be \u2013 the answer is not going to be very solid. Anyway.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> You could\u2019ve saved that for the end then, Matt, if it\u2019s going to that boring of a leadup.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b><a id=\"MIDDLEEASTPEACE\" name=\"MIDDLEEASTPEACE\"></a>QUESTION:</b> Sorry. I want to start with the Mideast.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You\u2019re obviously aware of what happened yesterday and what\u2019s been happening over the course of the last month along the Gaza border. Today your \u2013 Ambassador Haley at the UN said that the Israeli Government had acted with restraint in dealing with the protests along the border. And I\u2019m just wondering, is that really \u2013 is that the position of the government, that the Israeli \u2013 that Israel has acted with restraint in dealing with these protests?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have her comments right in front of me to be able to put those into the proper context. I think what the ambassador was referring to is compared to how other countries in other situations handle certain things. But I\u2019m not going to parse her comments. I\u2019d have to refer you up to the USUN for additional information on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> There was a \u2013 the United States Government was notable for being one of the few, if not the only, who did not at least call on the Government of Israel to take restraint. Other governments went much further. They condemned the \u2013 their actions and the deaths of almost 60 people just yesterday. Are you in a position to be able to say that \u2013 to criticize or to otherwise say that Israel might not be acting in a proportionate way?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, first let me say we regret the loss of life. We regret the loss of all life. Ambassador Haley said that as well. White House officials have addressed that in addition to that. But let\u2019s go back to something that we have covered extensively here, and let\u2019s go back to the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. We have had many Gazans who have suffered at the \u2013 from the loss of medical care, not being able to have access to enough medical care, not having access to consistent electricity, food, jobs, and many other things as well. The misery that is faced by people in Gaza is because of a result of Hamas. That is something that we come back to. People want to blame Israel for all of this that is going on over the past few weeks. Let\u2019s take a look at the dire situation that people in Gaza are facing, and that is a result of Hamas\u2019s governing. Let\u2019s not forget that. People like to lose sight of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I don\u2019t think --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that what the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Michelle, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s necessarily not blaming Hamas for part of this. But the point is so many U.S. allies are also just at the very least saying the words Israel should use some restraint. Why does the U.S. seem to not want to just even make that simple statement?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Michelle, I said we regret the loss of life. That is very clear. The administration has said that consistently. We\u2019ve said that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But that\u2019s not (inaudible) restraint.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hold on. We\u2019ve said that on numerous occasions. We have seen how Hamas continues to incite violence. The actions, the activities that are taking place there that you\u2019re all referring to, would certainly stop if violent protests were to stop and if Hamas were to stop inciting violence, encouraging people to go up to the border fence, encouraging people to cut through the border fence, encouraging people to run down that border fence and into Israel, sending these kites over the fences \u2013 all of those activities. They\u2019re encouraging people to do those activities, and might I remind people that is not a safe place to go. It is not a safe place for people to bring their children. If that were to stop, then certainly the violence would stop.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So when the UK calls for an independent investigation of the killings that have happened there, would the U.S. support that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That\u2019s a hypothetical. I\u2019m just not going to get into it. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yesterday --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Said, go right ahead. Hi, Said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Hi. Yesterday the White House said that all the blame rests with Hamas, no blame on Israel whatsoever. So do you agree with that statement that Israeli soldiers that shot these people, killed 60 people, six of them are children, are not responsible whatsoever by any degree?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Israel has a right to defend itself. When people are being sent to the border, they are bringing weapons, they are threatening to cross through the fence, they are throwing Molotov cocktails \u2013 Israel has a right to defend itself. But I want to be clear about this also that we do regret the loss of life. Ambassador Haley addressed that today. She called the loss of life deplorable. And let\u2019s once again get back to why the situation is so miserable. The United States would like to see peace. That is a priority for this administration. We would like to see \u2013 we would like to see both sides be able to come back, sit at the table, and have conversations about a good and peaceful solution. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not there at this point, but we hope that we will be soon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I fully understand what you\u2019re saying. Now, according to all reports, there has been no firing from the Gaza side by anyone so far since the \u2013 since the 30th of March. But I just want to ask you once again: There is absolutely no blame whatsoever that should fall squarely on Israel?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Said, I\u2019m not --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Or Israeli snipers?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- going to parse every single event that happens. But let\u2019s remember why the situation has become so troubling. Let\u2019s remember how Hamas continues to incite violence. If they really wanted peace \u2013 if they really wanted peace, they would call for peace, and we don\u2019t see them doing that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLesley, you had a question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I want to ask --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Do you really believe that the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem had nothing to do with inciting some of this violence?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, we have seen the demonstrations, and we have watched the demonstrations over the past six weeks. These demonstrations are nothing new. Our embassy was set to open for quite some time when the President announced it late last year. There have been other countries as well that have announced that they\u2019re opening their embassies as well. If Hamas wants to use that as an excuse to rile people up and to encourage violence, that is their choice. It\u2019s an irresponsible choice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And then the Palestinian representative was withdrawn today from Washington. Was there any kind of protest letter or communication with the State Department regarding this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m not aware of that, myself, if there was. The PLO office though remains open in Washington. You\u2019d have \u2013 I\u2019d have to refer you to the Palestinians for more information on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So Heather --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Hi, Barbara.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah. Just to say \u2013 you said that the misery in Gaza was because of Hamas. And of course, Hamas has not done a very good job of governing. But are you seriously saying the blockade of Gaza has not contributed to the misery? I mean, that seems to be self-evident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, we have a \u2013 not we, but there are a group of people \u2013 there is a group of people in Gaza that don\u2019t have access to all of the things that most of us do each and every day. We have pretty much unfettered access to healthcare, to clean water, to electricity \u2013 all of those things \u2013 and that has been a problem there. And when you fail to provide people with the basics that they need, they can turn \u2013 they can become frustrated and they can certainly turn to violence, and Hamas is certainly encouraging them to do that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And when you block the borders in Israel and in Egypt and people can\u2019t get in and out, and foods and goods can\u2019t get in and out, the same thing happens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, I would just say that Israel has certainly concerns and they\u2019re right to have concerns. I saw it myself \u2013 a terror tunnel that was going from Gaza into Israel, for example. They have legitimate concerns about their security and people trying to send weapons and other things through the various checkpoints. So that\u2019s a concern of theirs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So all of the situation in Gaza is completely the fault of Hamas?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>It\u2019s the primary responsibility \u2013 it\u2019s primarily the responsibility of Hamas. This is the first time we\u2019ve said this. We\u2019ve been very clear about this all along, okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And in terms of an independent investigation, I don't think it\u2019s a hypothetical because it has been called for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It\u2019s being called for right now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So what \u2013 is there any chance the Americans --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don't have anything for you on that, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, I\u2019d like to ask you \u2013\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b> Yeah. Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, could I ask you \u2013\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Go \u2013 hold on. I\u2019ve already --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- a question about Ambassador Friedman?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Hold on. I\u2019ve already talked to you. Hold on. Michel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can we switch to <a name=\"IRAQ\"></a>Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Certainly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can we --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. I\u2019ll come right back to you. Okay. One --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Very quickly, one question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Hold on. One more for Said, and then I\u2019ll go over to you, Michel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. I appreciate it. I asked Ambassador Friedman on a teleconference the other day whether he considered East Jerusalem to be occupied territory or whether he considered the West Bank to be occupied territory. And he said: Well, look I am \u2013 I have my own personal views. As the ambassador of Israel, I am not the ultimate policy maker, so I\u2019m going to defer to others. I think the situation in West Bank is unique, unprecedented, and so on. What is your position on the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Is it occupied or is it not --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Our position on that has not changed. You and I have gone around and around about this many times before. I can just tell you our position on that hasn\u2019t changed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What is it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Our position on that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is your position occupied or not occupied?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m going to leave it at this. Our position on that has not changed. We\u2019ve discussed this before. I\u2019ll sound like a broken record. Okay, let\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Let\u2019s move on. Michel, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible) recognize the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah. Heather, do you have any comment on the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Wait, before we go to Iraq \u2013 among the questions that have been asked about the whole Gaza situation for a while now is the situation \u2013 the death of the Palestinian photographer, news photographer, and then the death later of \u2013 from injuries of another Palestinian journalist. The first one to die had been a recipient of USAID funding. You guys said you were going to look into that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>That money was never transferred over to that individual. Last I checked, that is still being investigated. I don't have anything additional for you. But when I do, I\u2019d be happy to bring it to you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay, but should --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> When you say that you regret the loss of life just now --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- I mean that would include a working journalist as well, right? This --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Matt, we\u2019ve --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Because --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think I can blankly say that the United States Government regrets the loss of life. Okay? Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But in so many flashpoints that are sensitive around the world, regularly the U.S. Government calls for restraint on all sides. It\u2019s such a common, simple thing to say. Why in this case is it so difficult? What would be wrong with calling for restraint on the part of Israel?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think this is a complex region. We\u2019re looking at exactly why protests are taking place, why Hamas is encouraging people to go out and protest, why Hamas is encouraging people to go out right up to the border fence, why they\u2019re encouraging people to try to knock down that fence and go into Israel, why they\u2019re sending kites with Molotov cocktails to try to burn down the fields. Michelle, this is not as innocent as it may seem to many people. Hamas is trying to encourage people to do that, and by doing that, they are putting Palestinian lives at risk. Many people are expecting or are wanting people to be sympathetic to Hamas. We are not going to be sympathetic to Hamas. Hamas does not take care of its own people and it\u2019s inciting violence, and we\u2019ve seen a death occur as a result, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Then why did the Secretary of State --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t have --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>-- have nothing to say on this issue?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t have anything more for you on that, okay. I wasn\u2019t there at the time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>(Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Let\u2019s move on. I don\u2019t have anything more for you on this, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>(Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, guys, you\u2019ll want to go on all day. We\u2019ve got a big world to cover, other things going on. Nick, I\u2019ll come back to you on something else. Michel, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Yeah. On Iraq and the Iraqi \u2013 and the parliamentary elections. Do you have any comment?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I think it\u2019s certainly notable, first of all, that Iraq held elections that were largely free of violence. Imagine, think about not long ago, ISIS had controlled large swaths of that country. And the fact that they were able to pull off elections that were relatively free of violence is certainly a pretty amazing feat and a testament to the Iraqi people. We congratulate Iraq and the Iraqi people for participating in the democratic process yet once again. Iraqis are certainly eager to build a safe and prosperous future for themselves in the context of a government that\u2019s sovereign and stable. So we\u2019d like to congratulate them for doing that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I have two more on this, Heather. Do you have any comment on Moqtada al-Sadr, who emerged as the big winner in these elections?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes. Let me just remind folks that he wasn\u2019t an actual candidate on any of the ballots, but yet his slate of people were candidates. Iraq is still finalizing its election results right now. They\u2019re likely to have to form some sort of coalition government, so I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the process and presume how things are going to look in the end. But I think the overarching theme right now is congratulations to Iraq for holding democratic and free elections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>And on the formation of the new government, Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s commander Qasem Soleimani is in Baghdad to discuss the formation of the new government. How do you view this Iranian role in the formation of the government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We have a good relationship \u2013 bless you \u2013 with the Government of Iraq, and we believe that we will continue to do that. There have been many \u2013 in Iraq and in other countries as well \u2013 that have been concerned about Iran\u2019s reach into many other countries. That is certainly always a concern of ours, but we have a great deal of trust and faith in the Iraqi people and whoever ends up governing, whatever the structure is, the governing of that country going forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Is Brett McGurk \u2013 is he still --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Are you concerned --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Sorry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Is Brett McGurk there for the talks along relations to the elections?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I can confirm he is in Iraq right now; I don\u2019t have the details of his entire itinerary and why he\u2019s there. I can see if I can get more for you on that. Okay. Hey, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>And also some are \u2013 one more here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And also, some of the political parties are charging that the election was rigged by groups in \u2013 that were probably backed by Iran. Do you have any comment on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah. I can just say the Independent High Electoral Commission \u2013 that\u2019s basically the Iraqi equivalent of the Federal Election Commission \u2013 they are investigating; they are taking a close look at allegations of fraud and intimidation. There were civil society observers who were participants or who \u2013 involved in watching the process. And there were also international observers who were on the ground as well, and they have reported to us that they found the elections to be credible. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>What --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Hi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>What do you see as next steps in this political process? And are you concerned that if it takes too long that there may be a resurgence of Islamic State or other insecurity?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re not going to get ahead of that process right now. We have faith in the Iraqi Government, and so we\u2019re just going to wait and see how this all plays out. They\u2019re still finalizing the election results, so I don\u2019t want to get ahead of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>And you\u2019re comfortable that the leading two party lists include people who were opposed to the United States presence in Iraq up to 2011?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We are very well aware of Moqtada al-Sadr and his background and his positions now, yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>And as well as the Conquest list, which includes figures like Qais al-Khazali?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t have any information on the so-called list that you mentioned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>They were number two.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. I don\u2019t have any information on that, Laurie. I\u2019ll see if I have anything more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>(Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Let\u2019s switch on. So North Korea? Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Okay. I guess you saw just before the briefing the reports that North Korea threatens to cancel its participation in the summit in Singapore because of the joint exercises, military exercises with South Korea. We were told by South Korea that they were okay with these exercises. What has changed? Did --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Well --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>-- Secretary Pompeo spoke about that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>So I just saw that report as I was coming out here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>-- when he was there?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>So we haven\u2019t had a whole lot of time to dig into that. I will say that Kim Jong-un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the Untied States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises. They\u2019re exercises that are legal; they\u2019re planned well, well in advance. We have not heard anything from that government or the Government of South Korea to indicate that we would not continue conducting these exercises or that we would not continue planning for our meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un next month.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So they didn\u2019t tell you anything about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We have no information on that whatsoever. What we have to go on is what Kim Jong-un had said before, that he understands and appreciates the importance to the United States of having these joint exercises. The Republic of Korea has as well. We\u2019ve received no formal or even informal notification of anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So you continue to plan the summit as --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Absolutely. We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Isn\u2019t a report on the official North Korean news agency at least an informal notice or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Did it actually go out on there? Because I got this just as I was walking out here, so I haven\u2019t had a chance to fully sit down and investigate. But this is \u2013 that would be news to me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Great.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> They\u2019re calling the exercises provocative and they\u2019re calling them --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, they\u2019re certainly not provocative. These are things that we do all around the world with many of our partners and allies. These are things that have occurred for decades and decades. Again, I\u2019ll say this for a third time, Kim Jong-un had said that he understands the importance to the United States that we conduct these joint exercises, these joint exercises continue to go on, so okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. In addition to saying that they might cancel the U.S.-North Korea summit, they\u2019ve also canceled high-level talks with South Korea over the military drills. Do you have any comment on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can\u2019t confirm that. I would just have to refer you to those respective governments.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But would you see that as an unwelcome sign?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I \u2013 guys, I would not get ahead of ourselves here. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. This news just came out. We need to verify it, get additional information on that, but we\u2019re going forward and planning our meetings next month, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi, yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Still on North Korea but not on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So Secretary Pompeo said on Sunday that the U.S. would have to provide security assurances to the Kim regime. Is that what he told Chairman Kim when he was in Pyongyang meeting with him, and if so, what was the response?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> So some of those would certainly fall under private diplomatic conversation. I was not there in the room when the Secretary spoke with Chairman Kim at the time. I \u2013 what I would go on is what the Secretary said in interviews in which he had talked about security assurances. Obviously, governments like that are concerned about their principals\u2019 security, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Hi. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So Secretary Pompeo has said that having a ambassador to South Korea is one of the high priority. Now that the \u2013 with the freeze of hiring, should we \u2013 what does the timetable look like? Should we expect a U.S. ambassador to South Korea before June 12th?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, I would refer you to the Senate, first of all. Let\u2019s see what they have to do, let\u2019s see what they can do to help speed this up. We look forward to having an ambassador in South Korea just as soon as we can get one. I don\u2019t know what the timeline is on that or the timeframe is on that, but we look forward to having him in place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can you confirm that Harry Harris --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hold on. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, no Secretary --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hold on a sec. Janne, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. In order to \u2013 me go?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes. Please, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> In \u2013 on North Korea. In order to \u2013 (coughs) \u2013 excuse me. In order to dismantle of North Korean\u2019s Punggye-ri, North Korean nuclear test site, on I think May 22nd \u2013 between the 22nd and 25 \u2013 only the reporters were invited to ceremony, but not \u2013 expert were not invited. Will the U.S. need verification or not? Do you have any comment on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> First I would say the United States and our allies look forward to getting some more information about that event that North Korea has said they would destroy that facility. I don\u2019t know if any of you are planning to go or hope to go over, but I\u2019m sure our Consular Affairs people would be okay with taking your calls, certainly. We look forward to learning more about that and seeing exactly what they have planned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You should have verification, that site, because they five times in a nuclear test. So why \u2013 you had to verify --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can just say our people will be all over this type of thing, whether it\u2019s now or in the future when our people can go in and start to verify. Hopefully we\u2019ll be in the position to be able to do that, but again, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of that process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, do you have \u2013 you mentioned the Senate would have a role to play in that. Has the administration formally nominated anyone for --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019d have to double check on that. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve actually formally nominated Admiral Harris to be the ambassador of South Korea, but I\u2019ll just double \u2013 take a look at it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But he is the nominee?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I \u2013 I\u2019ll double check on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKylie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So wait a second. Just to make sure I got this right, you\u2019re inviting all reporters to call Consular Affairs to ask them about traveling to North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019ll get in trouble with Consular Affairs. I\u2019m being lighthearted in that. I understand that the Government of North Korea has invited reporters. I\u2019ve not heard from any of you about that just yet.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKylie, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Will Secretary Pompeo be reaching out to North Korea to encourage them to carry through with this meeting with South Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t think he\u2019s picking up the phone and begging anybody to do anything at this point. We are operating under the idea and the notion that the President\u2019s meeting is going forward with Chairman Kim next month.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And if this meeting doesn\u2019t happen, will you still go forward?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That\u2019s a hypothetical. That\u2019s a hypothetical. Look, this news just came out. I can\u2019t verify it just yet. It\u2019s very early on in the process, but we\u2019re planning ahead for our meetings. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> How does that affect your confidence on North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Pardon me?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> North Korea making such announcements through state media ahead of the summit, how does that affect U.S. confidence on North Korea in pushing ahead with this summit \u2013 planned summit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, I would say that we\u2019ve seen some pretty good indications from them so far. It was just one week ago that we had three Americans who were being held prisoner in North Korea for far too long. The Secretary was able to bring home those Americans, and now they\u2019re home and reunited with their families.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo they have taken some steps in the right direction in having us and inviting this United States delegation to go to North Korea and saying that they\u2019re willing to meet with us, and they have said that we will commit to denuclearization. I think those are all good signs. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of this announcement that everybody\u2019s all worked up about until we have some time to take a look at things, okay? Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMichel, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, on the Gulf dispute, Secretary Pompeo has emphasized yesterday to <a name=\"UAE\"></a>UAE foreign minister the President\u2019s desire to see the Gulf dispute eased and eventually resolved.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And his hope that parties will engage constructively ahead of the U.S.-GCC summit. Was he trying to put a deadline for the GCC to resolve their dispute?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Initially, the GCC summit was supposed to be sometime this spring. I\u2019d have to double-check this --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> September?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- but it\u2019s now been moved to September.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can\u2019t remember the date exactly, but it\u2019s been moved. This is something that\u2019s important, though, for the President, and the President has talked to many of those countries. When Secretary Pompeo was recently in Saudi Arabia, he had conversations with the government there, also spoke with the Jordanians about this as well since they are our strategic partners in the region, about the importance of solving this dispute. The dispute\u2019s been going on now for, oh, 10 months or so. It\u2019s gone on far too long. So the President has said enough is enough, let\u2019s put an end to this and move forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is September a deadline?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a deadline, but last I had heard that that is when we have a meeting scheduled on GCC. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b><a id=\"DEPARTMENT2\" name=\"DEPARTMENT2\"></a>QUESTION:</b> Can I ask about the hiring freeze?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible.) Do you have a number for \u2013 the number of positions that were left unfilled because of the freeze and then how quickly you expect there to be movement on those jobs?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah. I don\u2019t have any numbers for you just yet. We are all very happy, as you all have worked here long enough to have known how frustrating it was for many people who wanted to get jobs at the State Department who were told no, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re not hiring as a result of the hiring freeze. This is something that the Secretary looked at very early on when he came on board. In fact, before he came on board, he had been briefed on this when he was briefed about the various issues that had to be resolved or various difficult issues at the State Department, and that was one of the things very early on that he wanted to take a very close look at, a careful look at, and has made this decision to lift that hiring freeze.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI don\u2019t have any numbers for you just yet. This is all pretty fresh and pretty new, but if I can get some numbers, I\u2019ll let you know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So can you, as you\u2019re checking that, also find out if this is going to affect the intake of new \u2013 of A-100 classes?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I believe that it does help facilitate, because we\u2019ve been getting some phone calls from young people asking if they can now get in, so I believe this helps sort of pave the road for some of those younger people to get in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. But could you find out a hundred percent --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- for sure if it was --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I will find out 100 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On <a name=\"TURKEY\"></a>Turkey?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Hold on. Hey, Abbie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b><a id=\"MIDDLEEASTPEACE2\" name=\"MIDDLEEASTPEACE2\"></a>QUESTION:</b> Can I go back to the Middle East for a moment?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We\u2019re done with the Middle East. I got nothing left for you. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> This is a separate question not related directly to the Gaza, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And then we\u2019ll move on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have any further explanation for why it was that Pastor Jeffress was chosen to participate in the ceremony given his past controversial comments?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can just tell you that Ambassador Friedman, I know, was looking at a variety of people to be a part of the service or the ceremony, and that\u2019s who was invited. I don\u2019t have anything more for you on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Was the State Department aware of some of his past comments regarding specifically Mormonism, Islam, Muslim, and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We certainly would not agree with --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- Jewish --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- his assertions. We would certainly not agree with the pastor\u2019s remarks, some of his controversial remarks that he has made about various religious groups, but he was chosen by Ambassador Friedman, who was certainly welcome to do so, and made that decision.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, wait, so that means that if not \u2013 even though you don\u2019t agree with those comments, you might say that they\u2019re wrong or what \u2013 I don\u2019t know what term you would use --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think I was just pretty clear. I said we do not agree with his opinion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But \u2013 so that\u2019s not disqualifying to be \u2013 I mean, does this \u2013 is this the embassy of the United States of America or is it basically Ambassador Friedman\u2019s embassy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> As we have seen before \u2013 I seem to recall not too long ago that there was another embassy that made some decisions \u2013 embassies certainly have their free will sometimes to make decisions about who they want to bring in as guest lecturers or people to lead a ceremony or some sort of a celebration. To my knowledge, we did not have any role in making that decision, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Not that we asked to. I just \u2013 I\u2019m not aware if we had any decision-making --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. So I just want to make sure I understand. So this is the equivalent \u2013 you\u2019re saying it\u2019s kind of like the equivalent of the Berlin situation?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just saying that embassies and people around the world bring in lots and lots of people who have various opinions. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And speaking of going \u2013 going back to that, when the U.S.\u2019s allies and eight European countries call for restraint on the part of Israel --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Michelle, I think we\u2019ve already --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- and they --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think we\u2019ve already covered this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And they asked for \u2013 but my question is different.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think we\u2019ve covered this already.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Are they wrong in asking for that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Michelle, listen, we\u2019ve covered this already. I don\u2019t have anything more for you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But there\u2019s still questions. I mean, the questions don\u2019t end just because you say that they do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have anything more for you on this. I think we\u2019ve covered it extensively. Okay. Go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much. A little bit closer to home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I wanted to find out the status of the visas for Cubans and also the preparations in Georgetown, Guyana for those Cubans who may wish to come to live in the United States and obtain their visas. Do you have any update on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I will take a look. I\u2019ll get in touch with our people in Western Hemisphere and see if I can get you some specific details on that. Okay? Okay, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On <a name=\"RUSSIA\"></a>Russia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Yeah, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You may have already seen the video that Russia President Putin drove the truck himself --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Oh, I did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- across a new bridge connecting the mainland Russia to the Moscow-annexed Crimea today, and which we note Ukraine has condemned such annexation. Would you have \u2013 would you like to comment, or did you have a reaction on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes, we certainly do. We saw as Vladimir Putin hopped in that truck and drove that truck from Russia into Crimea. We saw the construction and the partial opening of that bridge. It\u2019s over a strait. One of the things I want to mention about it is that the construction of that bridge certainly limits the ability to bring in goods via ship, so it\u2019s affected people \u2013 it\u2019s affected Crimea, it\u2019s affected Ukraine \u2013 in that way. The bridge represents not just an attempt for Russia to solidify its unlawful seizure and occupation of Crimea, but it also impedes that navigation that I just mentioned. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re watching carefully and is a concern of ours. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Do you have anything on the raid today by Ukrainian authorities on these two Russian news outlets and the arrest of a reporter?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I do. Yeah, that\u2019s another situation that we\u2019ve watched. And you all have heard me talk here about the importance of free speech. The arrests of journalists or searches taken of media outlets, if that is done, it has to be done in accordance with the law. It is something that includes international human rights law. We take those actions seriously. We hope that the government takes those actions very seriously. We understand that Ukraine, like a lot of other countries, has been concerned about intense propaganda. Goodness, when we talk with a lot of our allies and partners overseas, they certainly have fallen victim and understand the influence and the reach of Russian propaganda. So we do understand Ukraine\u2019s concerns about that. But overall, these are very serious actions that have to be taken in accordance with the law.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On Turkey?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The pulling of the ambassador from the U.S. and Israel \u2013 do you have any sense of how long this is going to be, and how would you say that it affects the relationship between Turkey and the U.S.?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to be. I\u2019d have to ask you to speak with the Turkish Government of that. We\u2019re certainly aware of Turkey\u2019s decision, and I think it\u2019s their decision and they\u2019re the best ones in the best position to be asked that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You don\u2019t have a reaction to it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, Turkey made that decision. That is their decision to make. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And is Secretary Pompeo still planning to receive his Turkish counterpart here in D.C. in the next days or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not aware of any meetings that we have fully solidified with really many governments at this point. When I \u2013 if I have those meetings, I\u2019ll be sure to bring them to you when I can.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay, and we\u2019re going to have to wrap.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b><a id=\"MIDDLEEASTPEACE3\" name=\"MIDDLEEASTPEACE3\"></a>QUESTION:</b> How is it not justification for killing \u2013 for Israel killing when you say Israel has the right to defend itself?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, we\u2019re done with this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Israel has a right to defend itself --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We\u2019ve already been there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- and there are no Israeli casualties --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- and there are literally tens of \u2013 there\u2019s over ten thousand --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think we\u2019ve covered this extensively already.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- Palestinian casualties in the \u2013 and a hundred dead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Go on, one last question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Do you have something else?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes. On the Lebanese.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Excuse me. Excuse me. No, no, no. That requires a response. And furthermore, I mean, the U.S. isn\u2019t mowing down people along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Isn\u2019t that accurate?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We are done with this issue. We\u2019ve covered it extensively already. I\u2019ve taken many questions on this, and we\u2019ve --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So Israel is off the hook again. Israel is off the hook again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Sir, thank you for your question. I think we\u2019ve covered this already, okay? I\u2019m sorry; I\u2019ll get back to you another time, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> That\u2019s okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(The briefing was concluded at 3:45 p.m.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s on-the-record conference call with our director of policy planning, Brian Hook. It\u2019s certainly been a busy week with calls and outreach to our allies and partners in which we\u2019ve been discussing our next steps on Iran. Following this, Secretary Pompeo will deliver a speech on Monday to outline the administration\u2019s overall strategy to counter Iran\u2019s malign influence. Director Hook is here to speak with us today in advance of that speech.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a reminder, this briefing is on the record. It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. Brian has just about 10 minutes to take your questions, so I would encourage you to be brief. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Director Hook for some brief opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks, Heather. Good to be with all of you. Just make a few points here. The Secretary \u2013 Secretary Pompeo will be giving a speech on Monday. It will be his first major foreign policy address as Secretary of State. It will be a very timely address because it is presenting the way forward post the Iran nuclear deal withdrawal. And he\u2019ll be essentially presenting a diplomatic roadmap to achieve a new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal, following the President\u2019s decision to end America\u2019s participation in the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary has had very good phone calls with the ministers, the foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We have been working closely with the Europeans over the last week at various levels of government \u2013 the President, the Secretary of State. I\u2019ve been in touch with the political directors of the E3. We\u2019ve had staff discussion. So we have been in very extensive and deep consultations with the Europeans on the way forward. Our broad approach now that we\u2019ve been emphasizing is that we need a new \u2013 a framework that\u2019s going to address the totality of Iran\u2019s threats. And this involves a range of things around its nuclear program \u2013 missiles, proliferating missiles and missile technology, its support for terrorists, and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we see an opportunity to counter and address Iran\u2019s nuclear and proliferation threats, its destabilizing activity, and to create a better nonproliferation and deterrence architecture for Iran and the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\u2019s broadly the way forward. I\u2019m happy to take some questions. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday; that\u2019s only three days away from now. And he looks forward to presenting a comprehensive strategy toward Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll start with our first question. That\u2019s with Josh Lederman from the Associated Press. Hi, Josh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I just wanted to ask you about the prospects of getting other countries, and particularly the Europeans, to join any kind of coalition. I mean, the Europeans are moving ahead with using the blocking statute; they\u2019re even considering direct transfers to Iran\u2019s central bank. So what makes you think they\u2019re going to join you? And if you don\u2019t get the Europeans or actually any of the P5+1 on board, can this coalition still have enough weight to succeed in bringing Iran back to the table? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that we agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on. During the negotiations with the E3, we made a lot of progress not only \u2013 I mean, just on the nuclear piece, on the \u2013 on sunsets, on ICBMs, on a stronger inspections regime, but also on the regional activities, human rights, the range of missiles that are destabilizing the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we, I think, have the very \u2013 I think we assess the situation very similarly in terms of the wanting to take a comprehensive approach. When President Macron was in the United States he talked about the four pillars, and his \u2013 what he was talking about is a very comprehensive approach. And I think for the last many years, the last three years or so, the JCPOA gave a lot of people a sort of false sense of security that by addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, that we were somehow then addressing the totality of Iranian threats. And it\u2019s important that we \u2013 that we change that dynamic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think that, again, we agree on more than we disagree, and we, as I said, have been working with the Europeans over the last week or two, and just in consultations with them, and we want to continue the momentum from our work with our European allies. And we see this, the coming months, as an opportunity to expand our efforts and to work with a lot of countries who share the same concerns about nonproliferation, about terrorism, about stoking civil wars around the region, and so we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re very hopeful about the \u2013 about the diplomacy ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Brian. Next question, Michael Gordon from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Hi, Michael.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Hook, the diplomats in Europe that I\u2019ve spoken with have said that it\u2019s clear the administration wants tough sanctions, but the administration has yet to spell out in any detail what it \u2013 the arrangements that it thinks should be put in place now that the JCPOA has been scrapped. What specific nuclear constraints do you think are necessary post-JCPOA in the sphere of enrichment or other nuclear activities? And if you can\u2019t say what you want in terms of nuclear constraints, how can you ask the Europeans to impose tough sanctions? You\u2019re asking them to impose tough sanctions but you\u2019ve not defined your goal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think, Michael, that\u2019s part of the reason why the Secretary is giving a speech on Monday. But Brian, I\u2019ll let you take it from here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, that is \u2013 this is \u2013 as I said, this will be the Secretary\u2019s first major foreign policy address. He has decided to make that on Iran. And we will be discussing our vision to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has had a definite military dimension to it, and the Iranians have yet to come clean on the military dimensions of their nuclear activities. That is going to be part \u2013 I mean, obviously with what Israel disclosed recently, that Iran has been protecting and preserving a vast atomic archive while it has been implementing the JCPOA, and of course that increases the relevance of the sunsets. We don\u2019t believe that Iran has earned the trust of the world to have restrictions on its nuclear program lifted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Carol \u2013 sorry, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, go ahead, Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Carol Morello from <i>The Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing this. Say, Donald Tusk said some pretty strong things a couple of days ago about the administration. Basically, I think he said: With friends like this, who needs enemies? But at least we now know if you need a helping hand, you don\u2019t have to go farther than the end of your arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I was wondering what, if anything, that Secretary Pompeo will be doing to address the lingering resentment over Iran. I realize that\u2019s not the only issue, but that\u2019s certainly one. And also, if you could address a little bit of what kind of negotiation do you see with Iran. You seem to be seeking a surrender on their part, not a negotiation. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah. The President expressed his appreciation to our European partners. And we have worked, tried to fix the significant flaws in the nuclear deal to counter Iranian aggression. He believes very strongly in supporting the Iranian people. We believe that our shared values and commitment to confront sort of the common security challenges will transcend any disagreements over the JCPOA. And we weren\u2019t able to bridge all the gaps between our respective views on the JCPOA. We think that we\u2019ve been able to make a lot of progress on the range of issues on the nuclear and security sort of objectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture, a new framework, and I think that, again, people, I think, are overstating the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Brian, thanks. Lesley Wroughton from Reuters is next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, hi, Brian. I kind of want to come back to what the others are trying to say, because at a time when \u2013 a sensitive time when you\u2019re actually trying to get Iran to be part of discussions, it seems that you\u2019re pushing them away. How does one convince them through this new architecture that it\u2019s to their benefit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Well, you\u2019ve seen the protests in Iran, and you\u2019ve seen their dissatisfaction with \u2013 I think the Iranian people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime which have not helped the Iranian people. The President has spoken very eloquently about the concerns of the Iranian people. And so we \u2013 the President has said \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if it was the President said it or \u2013 but we have said that we are ready to negotiate a better deal, and there are a range of nations that can be a part of that. We certainly have the folks within the JCPOA, but we think there are other countries that also share these concerns, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, last question is Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. Hey, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Brian, do you have a timeframe for how long the U.S. would like this next round of negotiations to occur? At what point would the U.S. just say this is not going to happen? And can you also draw a parallel to North Korea? One of the things the administration has said about why North Korea came to the table was this maximum pressure campaign that left it so isolated diplomatically and economically. Do you believe that you could obtain the same scenario with Iran, that you would be able to create a similarly sort of airtight sanctions regime again with them?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK: </b>With the \u2013 by reimposing the sanctions that were lifted under the JCPOA, that will bring economic pressure to bear on Iran. It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago. We very much want a diplomatic outcome, one that is going to increase the security of the American people. We thought that the JCPOA provided too much in return for too little, and we also thought that it had very strong deficiencies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are going to be very focused on trying to achieve the President\u2019s national security objectives, and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions is part of our diplomatic strategy to try to achieve a better security architecture. And so the goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be discussing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe very much want to be \u2013 have a very kind of up-tempo diplomacy, one that\u2019s very focused and very determined to achieve our national security objectives. And Secretary Pompeo is committed to spending as much time as necessary with his team to achieve our goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, everyone, we have to wrap it up. Brian, thank you so much for your time. Everyone, thanks for calling in. We look forward to having as many of you join us for the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday. I believe we\u2019ll be sending out a formal announcement if we haven\u2019t already. So we look forward to talking with you. The embargo has now been lifted. And have a great weekend, everyone. Brian, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

The forum is a result of cooperation between the United States and Brazil, and the Permanent Forum on Security. They are working there to fight transnational crime. They aim to foster continued teamwork, combat drug trafficking, arms trafficking, cyber-crime, money laundering, and also terrorism. Yesterday in Buenos Aires, the deputy secretary joined representatives from Argentina, Canada, Australia, Mexico, and Chile to condemn the fraudulent electoral process that culminated in sham elections in Venezuela on May the 20th. He echoed Secretary Pompeo\u2019s vow that the United States will take swift economic and diplomatic actions and welcomed a strong statement from the Lima Group unequivocally calling out the illegitimate electoral process and responding to the national \u2013 the regional humanitarian crisis caused by the Maduro regime\u2019s rampant corruption and also mismanagement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also want to note recent sanctions announcements that were made both on Friday and on Monday of this week. These sanctions reflect the continued commitment of the United States to use every appropriate diplomatic and economic tool to hold the corrupt Maduro regime accountable. The United States stands with the Venezuelan people in their efforts to restore democracy to their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to that, I\u2019d like to note our pleasure in announcing the announcement by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, an additional $7 million, bringing the total U.S. assistance thus far to $8 million in the fight against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As you know, there is an Ebola virus outbreak there right now. The $7 million in additional funding includes 5 million specifically authorized by Secretary Pompeo to address this crisis. One million of that money came from USAID. The funds will provide immediate resources to help combat the spread of this deadly disease. The U.S. Government is committed to global health security and commends the proactive efforts of the Congolese, and also our other international partners to control this outbreak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd lastly, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression in Ukraine. This has been one of the most violent weeks of the year. Five Ukrainian soldiers are now dead and 23 have been wounded. The fighting has not spared civilians either. A 13-year-old boy and his father were killed in a Ukrainian Government controlled territory when artillery shells struck their home. A pipe carrying chlorine gas at the Donetsk water filtration station was struck by artillery shells.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Kremlin controls the violence in eastern Ukraine and could bring this violence to an end tomorrow if the Kremlin wanted to do that. Russia has claimed it wants to protect Russian speakers, but as our Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, Kurt Volker has pointed out on numerous occasions, there\u2019s nowhere in the world more dangerous for Russian speakers right now than in eastern Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and civilians continue to die in a conflict manufactured by the Russian Government with forces that arms, equips, leads, and trains. And while Russia perpetuates the violence in eastern Ukraine by pouring money, soldiers, and resources into the region, the Russian economy continues to stagnate. We call on Russia to end its aggression in Ukraine and live up to its commitments when it signed the Minsk agreements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Do we start with you again?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>That seems a little unfair, but okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Well, I don\u2019t know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay, go right ahead, Matt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I don\u2019t think so. Just before I go onto something else, quickly on Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"VENEZUELA\"></a><b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m sorry I was spacing out a little bit there when you were reading your statement. Did you talk about the PNGs of the charge and the number two?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I did not, though.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I didn\u2019t think so. It\u2019s so late that I\u2019m kind of --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know. Well, wasn\u2019t it worth it? Now you wonder why --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I suppose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>-- our briefing \u2013 why our briefing was late.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Anyway, so what can you tell us about the expulsions of these \u2013 your diplomats from Venezuela?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, look, I can just say we\u2019ve seen the reports. This happened not that long ago. But we\u2019ve seen the reports that the Maduro regime intends to declare our charge d\u2019affaires Todd Robinson and our Deputy Chief of Mission Brian Naranjo persona non grata. I can say we completely reject the false allegations that have been made by the Maduro regime against our two colleagues. And I have nothing further beyond that, but we\u2019ll let you know if we do get anything in addition to that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thanks. Can I move to Mideast for a --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Certainly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"ISRAEL\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> The Palestinians today took the \u2013 took their brief or complaints against Israel to the International Criminal Court. And I am wondering: one, what you make of that move by the Palestinians; and secondly, if this is going to have any impact on the way the administration now approaches the Palestinians either legally or any other way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we have long believed that these types of actions are not conducive to peace. We are not a party to the International Criminal Court, as many of you know. We oppose the actions taking place against Israel at the International Criminal Court because we see that simply as counterproductive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have spoken about this many times before. Our position on this matter is well known. We oppose actions against Israel as \u2013 at the International Criminal \u2013 Criminal Court \u2013 pardon me \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t help the cause for peace. And that is one of the priorities of this administration, getting the Israelis and Palestinians back to the table where they can have a good, concrete negotiation about the peace process going forward. And the ICC just doesn\u2019t do that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. But the ICC was created \u2013 and I realize that the U.S. is not a member of it, but it was created to provide accountability. So is there anything that you think that Israel needs to be accountable for to the Palestinians?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, I\u2019m not going to get into that question. I think we have long talked about the situation going on in Gaza. We\u2019ve long talked about the misery that the people face in Gaza is because of Hamas. We have seen and have watched as the previous clashes between the Israelis and Palestinians and those of Gaza have taken place. We\u2019ve continued to call on Hamas to take better care of its people; it\u2019s not taking care of its people. And I don\u2019t have really much beyond that to give you right now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Just on the Gaza thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I want to ask you about Ambassador Friedman\u2019s op-ed column. Is it the position of the administration, as it appears to be the position \u2013 the personal position of the ambassador, that the quote-unquote \u201cliberal media\u201d have blood on their hands for their coverage?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I can tell you I\u2019m aware of the ambassador\u2019s editorial. I don\u2019t have anything to say about that. I could just refer you to Ambassador Friedman for any questions about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, does it reflect the administration\u2019s view that there is --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have anything --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- there is quote-unquote a \u201cliberal media\u201d that has blood on its hands?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have anything for you on that. I\u2019d just have to refer you to the ambassador for anything (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> All right. Well, do you have anything on him posing for a photograph today that photoshopped out the al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount for a facsimile of what would be a third temple?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, I\u2019m not going to say much about this because this information just came to us as I was coming out to brief today. So until we have a full assessment of what actually happened, I\u2019m going to be limited in terms of what I can say about this particular incident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have received a statement, however, I can share with you from Ambassador Friedman. He says he was not aware of the image that was put in front of him when the photo was taken. He was deeply disappointed that anyone would take advantage of his visit to Bnei Brak to create controversy. The U.S. policy is absolutely clear: We support the status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. I don\u2019t have anything for you beyond that because, again, this was just \u2013 information was just coming out as I was coming out here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that a statement in his name, or is that something that was put out by the embassy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I have Friedman\u2019s statement. I have Ambassador Friedman\u2019s statement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> That\u2019s a statement from him. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I believe so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So \u2013 but does he apologize for it? I mean, this is something that is deeply --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, that\u2019s all I have. Look, again --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> This is deeply offensive to more than 20 percent of the population. He\u2019s laughing in the photograph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> He is saying that he was not aware of the image that was taken and that someone took advantage of him being at that location. I don\u2019t have anything beyond that. I\u2019d refer you over to our embassy to answer additional questions about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But on the op-ed --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, Michelle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Surely \u2013 thanks. Surely you\u2019re able to say whether or not he\u2019s speaking for the State Department or not, at least.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, I don\u2019t have anything to say for you about this. I can just refer you to the ambassador at this point. Okay, all right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, we just need to know: Who do this guy represent? Does he represent himself when he writes an opinion piece that says \u2013 that refers to his title?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, all I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t have anything for you on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Does he represent \u2013 does he represent the administration? Does he represent the State Department? Does he represent the President? I mean, he does do all of those things with the title \u201cambassador\u201d on it. And if that\u2019s just his personal opinion, then okay, whatever. But if that\u2019s the position of the administration, then we need to know about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I would refer you to the ambassador\u2019s office. Anything else? Shall we move on?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Hi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A follow-up. One quick follow-up on the PLO. Will you take action to close the PLO office because they\u2019ve now gone to the ICC?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I know that was an issue that was brought up before under our previous secretary. As far as I am aware, that is all under consideration \u2013 the status of the PLO office, I mean. And I\u2019m not going to get ahead of any additional \u2013 potential steps or actions on the part of that office and any determination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Hi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. So yesterday, Secretary Pompeo said, and I quote here, \u201cIran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.\u201d That is an issue that you\u2019ll be working on now? That\u2019s the strongest statement any U.S. official has made about the problem. Is that an issue that you\u2019ll be working on now with the Iraqi Government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Sovereignty is something that\u2019s in our National Security Strategy, the administration\u2019s National Security Strategy, and that is respecting the sovereignty of another government and respecting the sovereignty of Iraq. You heard what the Secretary had to say about that yesterday. We respect Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and we partner with the Iraqi Government. We have for very many years. We have a great relationship with the Government of Iraq. Their efforts to protect their sovereignty from malign forces both inside and outside its borders continue to stand and they are quite strong in that action.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And Muqtada al-Sadr, since he\u2019s so anti-Iranian, would be a good partner for this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not saying that. We will work with whoever the Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq decide to elect into its government. We\u2019ve had a long, good \u2013 longstanding, good relationship with the Government of Iraq and we will continue to have a good relationship with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And if I could ask you one more question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Mm-hmm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The Iraqi electoral commission released the election results without dealing with the multiple complaints of fraud. Do you think that issue needs to be more seriously investigated?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> My understanding is that is still under investigation, and that investigation or the look at the election process continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you support that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we certainly continue to support the organization that\u2019s going through and taking a look at the election results, including complaints that you mentioned, and as far as I know, that that process continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I follow up on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah. Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Brett McGurk has been meeting with multiple parties in Iraqi Kurdistan and in Iraq. He met also with those parties that complained about the elections and the \u2013 can you share with us what is the meetings about? What is he talking to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have the specifics about Brett\u2019s meetings. What Mr. McGurk typically does is he meets with a range of parties from the north, including in Baghdad as well. I don\u2019t have the specifics from those meetings, but I know that he\u2019s engaged in a lot of conversations with the government.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And also at the same time, Qasem Soleimani is also meeting with a range of political parties, and so what is \u2013 are you doing anything or what is the U.S. doing to contain the Iranian influence on the formation of the next government in Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We have long said that we think that \u2013 not long said, but we have said since the election that we thought for \u2013 a coalition government would be formed. We\u2019re not going to get ahead of that process. We will work with the government, whoever the people elect, whoever the people decide. In terms of whether or not he\u2019s meeting with Muqtada al-Sadr, I just don\u2019t have any information for you on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s move on to something else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"BURUNDI\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Burundi?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, there. Yes, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We saw a statement yesterday \u2013 thank you very much. Just wondering if you have more to add regarding the Burundi referendum, because the constitutional referendum could extend the president\u2019s rule through 2034.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Let me see if I do. I do somewhere have something on that. And of course, we had watched the news come out of Burundi as they were stifling conversation and debate within the media, including your organization, Voice of America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe May 17th referendum process in Burundi was marred by lack of transparency, the suspension of media outlets, including Voice of America and also your colleague here from the BBC as well, and also attempts to pressure voters. The government allowed vigorous campaigning by the opposition during a designated two-week period, but prior to that, we had heard about numerous cases of harassment and also repression of the referendum opponents in the months that preceded the vote and contributed to a climate of fear and also of repression, and that\u2019s a serious concern of ours. The overall absence of independent observers also undermines confidence in the reported results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want to be clear about our condemnation of the government\u2019s recent decision to suspend the Voice of America and also BBC broadcasts. The decision, along with other media restrictions, arbitrary arrests, harsh sentences for human rights defenders signals a continuing limitation on civil and political space in Burundi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLastly, I\u2019d like to say we remain concerned about the passage of a revised constitution, that passage of the revised constitution will be interpreted as resetting the presidential term limits. We want to highlight that the ruling party made a commitment under the Pretoria Protocol with respect to the principles of the Arusha Agreement, including the respect for term limits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you. Okay. Let\u2019s move on. Hi, Michelle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"KOREANPENINSULA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> On <a name=\"NORTHKOREA\"></a>North Korea --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- the major hesitation that we saw from the President today on that subject, how much of that would you say could be due to an early overselling of the situation on the part of South Korea? Or do you think that we\u2019re way past that by now and that this is something else?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, I think the Secretary addressed a lot of these questions, so I am not going to step on what the Secretary just had to say about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Oh, come on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- about our meetings potentially on June the 12th. Look, I think the South Koreans proposed to us some meetings that the government \u2013 Kim Jong-un of North Korea \u2013 was willing to undertake with the United States. I think the United States met this in a full, good-faith effort to try to have those conversations, but beyond that, I\u2019m not just \u2013 I\u2019m not going to step on what the Secretary just had to say, or the President, for that matter. I think they did a sufficient job of addressing that and I couldn\u2019t \u2013 certainly couldn\u2019t do any better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi. Go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Going back to the bilateral for a moment, the President said that there are certain conditions that we want to happen in reference to the U.S.-North Korea summit. Can you offer any clarification on what those conditions are?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think we\u2019ve been very clear all along \u2013 and the Secretary alluded to this before \u2013 complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. How many times have you heard me say that here? A lot. That\u2019s our policy. Our policy has not changed and we stand there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So still on North Korea but not on the meeting per se. So the closure of the Punggye-ri site \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about this before, but because \u2013 especially since they didn\u2019t bring in expert, like, witnesses mostly; they just let in the press. So what is the U.S. position on that? Do you see that as a good sign for them moving to denuclearization?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, look, I\u2019m going to be very careful about what I say on this entire topic, and I hope you will all understand that. I can only say we saw as reporters went there and covered what the Government of North Korea had said was happening, the dismantling of a nuclear site. We certainly welcome the announcement of plans to dismantle its nuclear test site. I\u2019d go back to permanent, irreversible closure that can be inspected and fully accounted for. That is a key step in the denuclearization for North Korea, and we look forward to learning more about the details of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, can I just follow up on the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- on the closure of the nuclear site. Did the U.S. request for any officials to be able to attend that closure?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can only tell you that we have not had a \u2013 an invitation that was extended to us. My understanding is that the journalists were invited, and I just don\u2019t have anything beyond that, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, sir. How are you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAN\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Iran, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A couple days ago, the ambassador \u2013 Russian ambassador in Syria urged all foreign forces to leave the country, including Iran and Hizballah, and a spokesperson in Tehran at the foreign ministry said no one can make Iran do anything against its will. How do you read that and were you surprised?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It looks like there is a tension between the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, look, I think it\u2019s particularly rich that Russia would say that other countries must leave Syria and that Russia wouldn\u2019t choose to do so itself. So I\u2019m pretty suspicious of countries that are there backing the government of Bashar al-Assad. We\u2019ve had a lot \u2013 far too many conversations about the brutality and the nature of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. They continue to this day to be backed by Russia and also Iran. They continue to gas and kill their own people. The United States will continue to work to hold them responsible and hold those other regimes responsible, as we believe the world will increasingly step in and try to do so as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But to mention Iran by name didn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t surprise you? Did it surprise you or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> To mention Iran by name.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not going to comment on anything beyond what the Russians may say about the United States or other countries. What they have to say about Iran \u2013 they can say whatever they like, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Hi. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> From the Secretary\u2019s remarks yesterday and today, there\u2019s \u2013 particularly yesterday, obviously, there was some speculation that essentially what he wants is \u2013 the U.S. wants is regime change in Iran. Do you --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That is not our policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But does the United States believe that it can work with this \u2013 the Government of Iran to achieve its objectives --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think the Secretary was very clear in his speech yesterday about our government\u2019s concerns \u2013 and other governments share these very rational concerns \u2013 about the activities of the Iranian regime. For far too long, administrations have simply looked at Iran through the lens of the JPCOA, through the nuclear agreement. This administration is choosing to focus on not only keeping Americans safe, keeping our allies and partners safe, and frankly, keeping the world safe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But his answer today wasn\u2019t, \u201cWe think these sanctions will work even if it takes a long time,\u201d it was once again calling on the Iranian people themselves to do something about that. So if he\u2019s not advocating regime change, why does he keep making it sound exactly like he\u2019s advocating regime change?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think what he\u2019s saying is this is up to the Iranian people. The Iranian people for far too long have lived under a regime that has mistreated its people. We\u2019ve seen the human rights abuses, we\u2019ve seen the clampdown on the media, we\u2019ve seen the clampdown on freedom of expression. That continues to happen each and every day. People are imprisoned; we don\u2019t always know where they are, including Americans who are being held there as well. So I think the Secretary was very clear about concerns that the Iranian people have themselves \u2013 the Persian people, a very proud people. And we\u2019ve seen a certain level of frustration and anger at their own government for promises that the government has not fulfilled. That government, back when the JCPOA was put into effect said, effectively, \u201cWe will share this money with you. You will see the fruits of this.\u201d The people have not seen that. Those promises were not fulfilled, and so we see an increasing level of frustration by their own people. Our policy --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So what does he want them to do?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Our policy is not regime change; but if the Iranian people were to choose somewhere down the road to make their views known, they\u2019re certainly welcome to do so. But that is not our policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Just to follow up on that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ2\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> I mean, on your previous comment about Iraq, you\u2019ve said essentially that the U.S. is willing to work with whichever government the people of Iraq elect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think it\u2019s up to the Government of Iran how they want to behave. We certainly haven\u2019t seen them behave as a responsible international partner for very many years. There\u2019s no one who knows that better than my colleagues here at the State Department when we look back at what happened to our colleagues and our embassy so many years ago. We\u2019ve seen that as Iran has had such a destabilizing influence in the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary was recently in Saudi Arabia, where we had conversations with our Saudi Arabian partners about the missiles that had been launched on Riyadh. I\u2019d go back to you and say this: Imagine that happening at any other country around the world, where the Iranian regime is launching missiles at an airport, a commercial airport. You could hit civilians, you could hit Americans, could cause a great deal of damage. The world should not tolerate that from Iran. The would certainly wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from other countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A couple things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And we\u2019re going to have to wrap. We\u2019re going to have to wrap in just a minute.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It\u2019s not actually Iran that\u2019s \u2013 are you saying that Iran is firing these missiles?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Iran is backing the Houthi rebels, and we\u2019ve been very clear about that. This is not the first time we\u2019ve had that conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible.) Also, when you say for far too long the Iranian people have lived under this \u2013 these abuses that you talked about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- you\u2019re referring back to \u201979, to the Iranian Revolution?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> This has happened for a very long time. This is nothing new, Matt. I don\u2019t think you should be surprised by this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> No, I just want to know: Are you drawing a distinction between the human rights paradise that Iran was under the shah?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I am simply saying that people there have experienced repression. They know that repression very well. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"SAUDIARABIA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> And then last one on Saudi, because you just mentioned it --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I just want to \u2013 you can go back to Iran. I just need to get a \u2013 I just need to get your reaction to the arrests of these women\u2019s rights activists. There seem to be more today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Are there reports of \u2013 of that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It might have been yesterday. I think it\u2019s up to 10 now, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have the number. I can just tell you Saudi Arabia, as I just mentioned, was a country we recently visited. We remain supportive of their overall reform agenda. I think that\u2019s an important step in the right direction. A lot of people here and around the world were pleased and very happy to have heard their decision about women being able to drive on their own, attending movie theaters, and things of this sort. I can tell you that we are watching this carefully. We are concerned about the announced detention of activists in Saudi Arabia. We support space for civil society and also free speech, but overall, we\u2019re concerned about it and we are keeping a close eye on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay, last question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On Iran, the Secretary of State yesterday and today talked about assassinations in the heart of Europe being carried out today by the Quds Force. Are there any details about that? We looked and couldn\u2019t find anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ask the Secretary about that himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I was rather late. I apologize.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> He has information and access to information that I do not. I\u2019m not able to comment on that in particular, but I can tell you that the Secretary has assured me that there is a basis for that point in his speech and he stands firmly behind that. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it\u2019s sort of classified intelligence information he\u2019s saying there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I won\u2019t comment beyond that, but I can tell you that the Secretary has assured us of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay, guys, we have to wrap it there. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(The briefing was concluded at 4:23 p.m.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDPB # 29\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n</div>"

How are you today?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Freezing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> It is cold. It\u2019ll keep you awake. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Put on a sweater, as Jimmy Carter would say. (Laughter.) Good afternoon, everyone. Hope you\u2019re well. I do actually remember the warmer days in here when people \u2013 I won\u2019t name any names \u2013 would fall asleep because it was so warm in here, so we try to keep you awake.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right. Good afternoon. A couple of announcements I\u2019d first like to make.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Are you talking about Matt?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It was not me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> It was definitely not Matt. It was not Matt. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"UZBEKISTAN\"></a>I\u2019d like to start with this, and that is the Secretary welcomed the president of Uzbekistan earlier today here at the State Department. This is President Mirziyoyev\u2019s first trip to Washington and will raise the strategic partnership between the United States and Uzbekistan to a new level. We applaud the president\u2019s ambitious reform program to improve the human rights situation in his country. These efforts have created the conditions for increased economic, political, and security cooperation between our nations. We recognize that Uzbekistan has an important role in making Central Asia a stable and prosperous region through initiatives like the C5+1 framework and in supporting international efforts to stabilize Afghanistan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs part of the visit, Ambassador Alice Wells, the senior bureau official for South and Central Asian Affairs, signed agreements to promote U.S.-Uzbekistan cooperation in the field of education. Agreements were also signed with other U.S. Government agencies to intensify cooperation on energy, agriculture, law enforcement, two-way trade, and also investment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"VENEZUELA\"></a>Next, I\u2019d like to address a very concerning situation following a riot that took place at a prison in Venezuela just yesterday. It is called the <i>Helicoide </i>prison \u2013 it\u2019s in Venezuela \u2013 and that is where U.S. citizens, including U.S. citizen Joshua Holt from Utah, are being held right now. You may have seen Joshua Holt\u2019s Facebook videos and the tweets issued last night by our U.S. Embassy in Caracas. We continue to have serious concerns about the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens who are being held there. The Venezuelan Government is responsible for the safety of all detainees in its prison system, including U.S. citizens in detention. We hold the government responsible for their safety and well-being.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe observed Mr. Holt through his video and he has confirmed that he is still safe. Last night, our chief of mission in Caracas, Todd Robinson, went in person to the ministry of foreign affairs and made repeated requests to the highest levels of the Venezuelan Government for information about the situation at that prison. Venezuelan authorities refused to meet with our chief of mission at that time. Prior to yesterday\u2019s events, our Acting Assistant Secretary Palmieri called in the Venezuelan charge once again to ask for the release of Mr. Holt on humanitarian grounds.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. embassy and the Department of State continue to press the Venezuelan authorities for their assurances of the safety of U.S. citizens who are detained in Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPUTYSECRETARYSULLIVANTRAVEL\"></a>Lastly \u2013 pardon me \u2013 I would like to mention our deputy secretary will travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina for the G20 foreign ministers meeting. I believe he leaves on Saturday. At the G20 meeting, Deputy Secretary Sullivan will address global economic, political, and security issues, including sustainable development. The conversations will set the stage for the G20 Leaders Summit that will take place in Argentina this November.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the margins of the G20 ministerial, Deputy Secretary Sullivan will meet with foreign ministers for bilateral discussions including the Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie. Following the G20, Deputy Secretary Sullivan will travel to Brasilia, Brazil, and that\u2019s where he\u2019ll meet with the Deputy Foreign Minister Galvao and launch the U.S.-Brazil security forum. That\u2019s a bilateral law enforcement initiative that will address transnational crime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile in Brasilia, the deputy secretary will discuss our joint economic growth agenda and global and regional issue, including the crisis in Venezuela. The deputy secretary will also meet with Embassy Brazil staff and members of Brazilian civil society.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPARTMENT\"></a>With that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions, but not before recognizing some of our colleagues in the back. We have some information officers, some press officers, who are just getting ready to head out to their posts. I have a list of where you all are going. It\u2019s an impressive array, so congratulations to all of you. And they\u2019ve ranged from going to places from Afghanistan to \u2013 let\u2019s see, where else? I remember that one. Afghanistan \u2013 come on, somebody say something. Don\u2019t be shy. Where else are you going?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Guatemala.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Guatemala, okay. Where else?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The Vatican.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Vatican. Oh, that\u2019s a tough one. (Laughter.) Okay, nice. Rome. Sir, where are you going?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Beijing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Beijing, all right. Well, thank you so much for your service. Godspeed and good luck to you out there. Let us know if you need anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMatt, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Laughter.) Thanks, Heather. Before moving on to North Korea, and I\u2019m sure the Middle East, I just want to ask you one brief one about the statement that the Secretary \u2013 was released in the Secretary\u2019s name this morning --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"LGBTI\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> -- about the LGBTI discrimination, anti-discrimination day, basically. It says in there, \u201cThe United States firmly opposes criminalization, violence, and serious acts of discrimination such as in housing, employment, and government services, directed against LGBTI persons.\u201d And I\u2019m just wondering how it is that you guys can say this \u2013 or say it and expect to be taken seriously \u2013 when this administration\u2019s stated policy is to discriminate against transgender people by not allowing them to serve in the military.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, let me first start out by saying the Secretary released a statement earlier today. This is a matter that\u2019s important to the State Department. Promoting, protecting, and advancing human rights, including the rights of LGBTI persons, has long been and continues to remain the policy of the United States Government. As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, \u201call human beings are born free and equal in dignity and in rights.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn terms of what you\u2019re addressing with regard to the Department of Defense and its policies, it\u2019s a matter that\u2019s being handled in multiple courts right now. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the court process, but DOD will continue to comply with the court rules.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But I --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And I don\u2019t speak for the department of Defense --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- but that\u2019s all I have for you there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I get that. But I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 but that\u2019s what the policy is. Whether or not the courts rule on it or not, the President has tweeted that that is his policy. And on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, Biphobia for the United States \u2013 I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s consistent for the U.S. to stand with LGBTI people when the stated policy is to discriminate against it, at least one section of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, again, that\u2019s before the courts. I\u2019m not going to address that. That is a Department of Defense issue. One of the things that we stand for here at the State Department proudly \u2013 and we continue to do so \u2013 is the respect for human rights. And that includes the right to love anyone you want, to spend time with anyone that you choose, and we stand firmly behind that and that hasn\u2019t changed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"NORTHKOREA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. Very briefly on North Korea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The President, in remarks made just a few minutes ago with the NATO secretary general, seemed to confuse or conflate the quote-unquote \u201cLibya model,\u201d which, as the national security advisor referred to and as has been generally understood I think everywhere in this town except for one person maybe, that model is the \u201903 \u2013 the Bush administration\u2019s \u201903, \u201904 pact with the Libyans that saw them get rid of all of their weapons of mass destruction, and not the next administration, the Obama administration\u2019s, military intervention in 2011 that \u2013 so I just want to make sure. The State Department understands the difference between these two things, correct?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> In terms of what the President said in his remarks, I would just have to refer you to the White House. I have not had a chance to speak with the White House since the President spoke. We\u2019ve been really busy here today. In terms of using any sort of so-called Libyan model, our model is to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and we stand firmly behind that, and that hasn\u2019t changed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. But there is still enough institutional knowledge left in this building, right, that understands what the \u201903, \u201904 Libya deal was?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can tell you that we have Libya desk experts and we have people here staffed up in the building who are experts --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. All right. Okay. So if there is --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- on the entire history, but I don\u2019t want to get into a history lesson here with all of you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Fair enough. I\u2019m not going to ask you for the details of the history. But I just want to make sure, even if people up the street on Pennsylvania Avenue don\u2019t understand the difference, the people who work for the department does.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I\u2019m not going to go there. I\u2019d refer you to the White House if you have any specific questions about his comments. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, Lesley.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hello. Given that the Secretary has been the contact with Pyongyang, has he personally reached out to anyone in North Korea regarding the summit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I will go back to what the President said, and what the President said earlier today is that we\u2019re making arrangements for the meeting. The Secretary has said to me \u2013 and I spent time with him this morning having this conversation about this very issue. Chairman Kim had asked for a meeting with the President of the United States. He addressed this with our Secretary. We are continuing to push ahead and plan in our preparations. Those continue at this time for a meeting between the President and Kim Jong-un in June.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But he has not been in touch with him?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m not going to get into all of the details. I can tell you we\u2019ve been closely coordinating with our allies. We provided \u2013 or at least confirmed our call with the Republic of Korea, just yesterday I believe it was. And we continue with our \u2013 excuse me \u2013 we continue with our preparations for that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Uh-huh. Yeah. Hey, Rich.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On North Korea, Acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton discussed the idea of a big down payment at a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> conference in Tokyo. To that, Senator Marco Rubio said that this is the reason he would prevent her confirmation, because that position undermines the President and is essentially a gradual back-and-forth \u2013 North Korea does something, the United States rewards it. Is the State Department seriously considering that or what is --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think, first, what I would encourage everyone to do \u2013 and our Acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton was speaking through a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> panel in Tokyo. I would encourage all of you to go back and read our comments. If you have not seen them yourselves, we can certainly provide them to you. The headline in that <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article \u2013 and we\u2019ve reached out to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> about this \u2013 is, frankly, inaccurate and overblown. What Susan Thornton was talking about is very similar and the same thing to what Secretary Pompeo spoke about, and that is that we would like to see a bigger, bolder, different, faster deal than the kind of deals that have been proposed before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSusan said \u2013 and I\u2019ll read part of her quote for you, because it was a lengthy panel in which she provided information on \u2013 she said, \u201cThere is an expectation that he\u2019s already committed to complete denuclearization.\u201d She\u2019s referring to Kim Jong-un there. \u201cAnd in his conversations with the South Koreans that there will be a big down payment, a big, upfront demonstration of his intention to do that, not just words and statements but also actions.\u201d Our policy remains the same. It\u2019s complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. What she said is completely in line with what Secretary Pompeo has said.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Are you going to have this gradual back-and-forth that the Secretary is (inaudible) about?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>No. And you all can appreciate this. Headline writers sometimes take your pieces and they kind of change those pieces and they go their own direction with things. So we\u2019ll be in contact with them to have some conversations about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Just to follow up on that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b> -- two questions. One is the tweet from Marco Rubio suggested that Susan Thornton was somehow undermining the President with her statements there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Not at all. Not at all. Look, Susan Thornton has \u2013 and continues to be a very valued, hardworking member of our diplomatic community. Susan Thornton has had the opportunity to meet with the President. They spent time together. I think it was in Beijing, quite a few months ago, when they were traveling. Susan Thornton had been nominated for her position by the White House. Susan Thornton has a great deal of respect among people here in the building. She has professionally \u2013 just as our other Foreign Service officers in the building \u2013 pushed forward the agenda of this administration.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that has impressed me the most about our Foreign Service officers here is whether or not they like the policy \u2013 and I\u2019m not speaking to Susan; I\u2019m speaking in general terms \u2013 whether or not they like the policy, they push it out. They\u2019re professional. They do their jobs, and they\u2019re patriots. So Susan has continued to work hard on behalf of this administration, the American people, and the State Department.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And just one follow-up on this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Or slightly different, but also North Korea. The Secretary\u2019s comments over the weekend about U.S. offering the full weight of trade and investment in North Korea were met in the North Korean statements \u2013 essentially they said they don\u2019t want U.S. investment. Was he surprised by that? Has that changed his thinking or tactics or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I think one of the things that the Secretary had addressed with Chairman Kim is the idea that North Koreans could have a brighter future, and by a brighter future that means economic investment. That does not mean \u2013 some news organizations misreported this \u2013 that does mean U.S. tax dollars going to support the regime of Kim Jong-un, not at all. That means if they denuclearize we could see \u2013 we could envision a future for North Korea where there\u2019s private investment, where private money goes into North Korea, whether it\u2019s building hotels or cinemas or whatever. That could be a future that North Korea could have, if they choose to denuclearize. And I think that\u2019s an exciting opportunity. I think it\u2019s something that \u2013 I can\u2019t speak for the North Korean Government, but I think that\u2019s something that was certainly at least somewhat appealing to them. Who doesn\u2019t want a brighter future for their own people?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi, Barbara. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Just to follow up on the Libya model, which the essence of it is to remove the nuclear program from top to bottom and then there\u2019s compensation, which I believe is what Mr. Bolton was talking about \u2013 that falls along the lines of what Secretary Pompeo has been saying as well, right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of what the President and what Secretary Pompeo and all of our colleagues throughout the interagency are planning to discuss with the North Korean Government. Those meetings will all take place. We\u2019re having meetings in the meantime where we talk and discuss how meetings in June will be structured and how those conversations will go, but as far as those plans are, we are not ready to reveal those at \u2013 right at this point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hello.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The President also said that if there\u2019s a deal, Kim Jong-un can have very strong protections. Can you give more details --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, I\u2019m not going to get into the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- or is part of a peace treaty or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m not going to get into the security situation there. But as you would imagine \u2013 I think we talked about this just two days ago, that governments have concerns, especially countries like that, that something could happen to their leader. That is it. I will leave it at that, that of course countries are certainly going to be concerned about such things. But I\u2019m not going to get into details of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi, Janne.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thank you, Heather. But it seems North Korea does not want to open Western styles, so why they going offer the United States \u2013 offer economically, provide all kind of investment or make a (inaudible)?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>You\u2019re asking what the motivation would be --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: --</b> for the private sector to invest in North Korea someday?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Well, I think it\u2019s like any country, right? Any country wants to have or perhaps would want to have that kind of private investment so they can grow their economy. There\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done in North Korea. Electricity is not readily available throughout large parts of that country. That\u2019s one potential opportunity. I\u2019m sure there are very many U.S. corporations that would certainly welcome being involved in helping to bolster its infrastructure, whether it\u2019s electricity, roads, or whatever. So that\u2019s the incentive for the private sector.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAgain, U.S. taxpayers would not be financing this. We\u2019re a long way off from that point, of course, because the country hasn\u2019t denuclearized, but the point is we\u2019re just talking about what could be a brighter future for that country and for its people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But Kim Jong-un concerned about if --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> There\u2019s a big market for Gap and McDonald\u2019s, I think.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, McDonald\u2019s go there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You sure the North Koreans want that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But if Kim Jong-un is concerned about even open their country, their people is the freedom to saying or freedom to watch WIFIs or whatever they use in electricity. He\u2019s concern about human right issues in North Korea, so the best (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Certainly, and human rights issues is something that we bring up very often with governments all around the world. We talked here just a few weeks ago about our Human Rights Report, in which we were very clear about our concerns, our very real concerns, about human rights issues in North Korea. Not that long ago, the President hosted a group of North Korean defectors who spoke about their experiences and why they chose to leave the country. They\u2019ve spent time here at the State Department as well. I don\u2019t have much more for you on it, other than to say that that is an issue that we continue to raise with many countries around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I change the topic very quick?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hold on, hold on. Something on the Susan Thornton \u2013 your explanation. You said that she talked about how this deal \u2013 the administration wants this deal to be bigger, bolder \u2013 did I hear this right? \u2013 bigger, bolder, faster, stronger? Is that like the motto here? Because I don\u2019t \u2013 because that sounds like the intro --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>No, she did not. She did not use those words, no.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> That sounds like the intro to The Six Million Dollar Man, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>You\u2019re dating yourself, Matt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>No, Susan --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But what did she say?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Susan did not use those words.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What did she say? Bigger, bolder --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>No.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> You --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Let me find it, hold on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, maybe it wasn\u2019t \u2013 maybe it wasn\u2019t her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>She said, \u201cThere is an expectation, as he\u2019s already committed to complete denuclearization, and in his conversations with the South Koreans, that there will be a big down payment, a big up-front demonstration of his intention to do that \u2013 not just words and statements, but also actions.\u201d That\u2019s what she said. I said that that is in line with the Secretary and what he had said over the weekend when he talked about how this program \u2013 we\u2019re hoping that this deal would be bigger and different and faster.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Different and faster, okay. Sorry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I can find the exact quote for you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Could I move on?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, could I move on to Human Rights Watch, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay, certainly. Okay, yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Hold on, hold on. One more on this before \u2013 I\u2019ll come over to you next, I promise.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. The President also said that the model of \u201cdecimating,\u201d quote, Libya would be the model if we don\u2019t make a deal with North Korea. Is that the choice that the U.S. is giving North Korea, either come to the summit or be so-called decimated?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m not going to get into the details of that. I\u2019d just refer you back to the White House for anything more on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay, hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And then also on that, the President suggested that Kim Jong-un perhaps no longer wants to have a summit because he spoke with China. Previously you have said that China has been helpful. What is your assessment now? Has China been helpful, or would you like for them to do something differently?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We have always said \u2013 and we\u2019ve been consistent about this \u2013 that China can always do more. China, as the key trading partner with North Korea, has an incredible amount of leverage with the North Korean Government. And so we continue to say to China that you can certainly do more, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I ask one more on --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, Said. No, we\u2019ve got to \u2013 let\u2019s move on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"ISRAEL\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah. I have a quick question on the Israelis last week expelled or ordered \u2013 issued an order to expelling the head of the Human Rights Watch in Jerusalem and the West Bank, Omar Shakir. He\u2019s an American citizen. They gave him 14 days to leave. I wonder if you are raising this with the Israeli Government and how would you view this. This guy is doing his job.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Said, I can just tell you we\u2019re certainly aware of the report. I\u2019d have to refer you to the Government of Israel for any questions about that. I\u2019m not aware if we\u2019re having any conversations with the Government of Israel about his case.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, but would you call on the Israelis to allow him to do his work?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, I don\u2019t have the specifics of that case or the situation, so I\u2019m not in the position to call on any government to do anything on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. Because this comes in after \u2013 the week before the Israelis disallowed the two \u2013 a Columbia law professor and a constitutional center official from entering the country. They were there held for 14 hours and then they were deported. So this \u2013 there is a pattern right there. Are you concerned that American citizens who might be speaking about Israeli abuses of human rights are being sort of intimidated or not allowed in because of their views?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Said, I don\u2019t have any information on that, and I\u2019m not going to accept that premise. I don\u2019t have any information on that. Countries certainly have a right to allow in individuals that they choose to allow in. The United States does. Every country around the world as sovereign nations have the ability to make some of those decisions, and I\u2019m saying that in general terms. I don\u2019t have any specific information on his particular case.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible) at least on --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible) criticize all kinds of human rights situations around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> What, Matt? What, Matt?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I\u2019m just wondering, are you looking in at least to the \u2013 asking the Israelis about the case of the Human Rights Watch guy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think I just answered that. I\u2019m not aware if we are or not.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, can you find out? Because I mean, when --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I will \u2013 I will certainly look into it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> As you are \u2013 you are correct that every country has the right to allow in who it wants to, but if an American citizen is unjustly deported or prevented from going into a country, it is certainly within the remit of this building to inquire and \u2013 as to the details and to complain, sometimes even loudly, if they see --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I will certainly see if I can find something for you on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. There have been major complaints about fraud in the Iraqi voting, and the UN Mission there has called on Iraq\u2019s Electoral Commission to investigate them, quote, \u201cimmediately and fully.\u201d What is your position on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah. So we spoke about this a little bit the other day. The vote tally is still underway at this time. We\u2019re certainly aware that there have been some challenges with that. We agree with the UN special representative who \u2013 the individual has called on the Independent High Electoral Commission to immediately and fully investigate those complaints, the complaints that you\u2019re referring to, concerning the overall electoral process in Iraq. We call for the release of final election results just as quickly as possible and just as quickly as they\u2019re ready. We understand the concerns that some people have had about that, and that\u2019s why we call on them to quickly do this and resolve it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"TURKEY\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Okay, and a question on Turkey. The foreign minister has said that there was a preliminary agreement about Manbij that was reached under Secretary Tillerson. At that time, you said that there was no such agreement. Is it still your position that there\u2019s no agreement between the U.S. and Turkey on Manbij?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That\u2019s correct. The talks about Manbij are ongoing, and nothing has been concluded. This is something that we addressed at NATO when the Secretary had met with his counterpart in Brussels as well, and so we just don\u2019t have any new updates for you on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On Iraq --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And I will also point out that we do have a new Secretary, and so he has the ability to have conversations with the Government of Turkey, and then they can decide a new way forward if they should want to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ2\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Sorry, Heather, a quick question on the election in Iraq because --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Are you disappointed in the level of turnout because it was very low? I mean, I worked back during the civil war and the turnout was much, much bigger. Are you disappointed? Do you think that people have lost faith in the democratic process in Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t see it as that at all. We have seen from time to time when we\u2019ve had higher or lower election turnouts in the United States, and many other countries have experienced that as well. But what is significant here is that the Iraqis held this successful election. The election went off with very, very limited violence. That is a tremendous success. And if we just wind back the clock to where Iraq was just a few years ago, when ISIS had controlled large swaths of that country, and now here people are turning out to vote and the biggest complaint we can find is a low turnout? Well, I\u2019d say congratulations to the Iraqi people for pulling off a successful election.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"TURKEY2\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Back to Turkey, please?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> As you know, Turkey has recalled its ambassadors to \u2013 from the U.S. and Israel. Can you give us an update? Is this straining U.S.-Turkish relations? And also on Pastor Andrew Brunson, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Sure. So first, in terms of Pastor Brunson, his case is one that we watch very carefully, very closely, not just here at the State Department. I know the Vice President has been keeping a close eye on it. Our colleagues at the State Department have been able to spend time in the courtroom with Pastor Brunson and having conversations with his family. This is also something that the President has watched very closely and carefully. It\u2019s something that this administration continues to bring up in its bilateral meetings with the Government of Turkey, and at the next opportunity, I would not be surprised that this comes up yet once again. Congress is also following this very carefully and very closely. I don\u2019t have an update for you on his case. I can check with some of our experts who are following this on a day-to-day basis and see if I can find anything more out for you on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> India?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And then you had a second question? Sorry.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, about the reaction to the embassy move and Turkey recalling its ambassador.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, we\u2019re aware that Turkey has recalled its ambassador. That is within Turkey\u2019s right to do so. And I don\u2019t see that as diminishing our relationship with the Government of Turkey. We \u2013 they continue to be an important NATO ally. That is being maintained and we look forward to our next conversations with the government.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On India?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAN\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> On Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes. So we are now just seeing those big companies in Europe who are just pulling their business out of Iran, and the European countries, they are just about to protest their companies. So I\u2019m just wondering, how is your negotiation with the European countries, or do you just consider some exemptions for the European companies for their business in Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, first, I can tell you that companies have time to wind down their activities, and that in part gives them the ability to decide what business decisions that they want to make. This administration has been very clear since day one its concerns about Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities, whether it is ballistic missile tests, terrorism around the globe, supporting the Houthi rebels in Yemen, firing off rockets and missiles into our strategic partner\u2019s territory in Saudi Arabia, to all that they\u2019re doing in Syria to bolster and prop up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, also doing things in Israel as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo Iran has a very well-documented litany of bad behaviors that it\u2019s continued to be involved with. This administration has been clear about that. We\u2019ve explained that to our European partners and others around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEarlier this week, we hosted about 200 ambassadors here at the State Department, where many of our assistant secretaries or at least several of our assistant secretaries had a chance to talk with them about our real and serious and grave concerns about Iran\u2019s destabilizing activity. That\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ve been doing. The Secretary has been having phone calls with his counterparts from the E3 expressing our concerns. These concerns are not a surprise to those countries, but the Secretary continues to talk with them about those concerns, but also the way forward. And that\u2019s why we are happy and thrilled that the Secretary\u2019s first foreign policy address will be about that very thing, about Iran and the way forward.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States will be working hard to put together a coalition not unlike the D-ISIS coalition, where we bring together a lot of countries from around the world with the specific goal of looking at the Iranian regime through a more realistic lens \u2013 not just through the lens of the nuclear deal, but rather through all of its destabilizing activities that aren\u2019t just a threat to the region, but are a threat to the broader world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it means that there won\u2019t be any exemptions for the European companies --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- or their businesses, with Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not going to get into all of the details of that. The Secretary will provide his speech. Also I can tell you Treasury and other agencies are involved as well, and they may have some decision making in all of that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"INDIA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> India?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Sir, why don\u2019t \u2013 what do you have on India today?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Two quick questions, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. I\u2019ll see if I can answer them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> One will be on India. Two-plus-two was postponed because we didn\u2019t have the Secretary of State. Now we have the new Secretary of State, congratulations, so when are we going to have this now two-plus-two because Secretary of Defense is ready?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Ah, yes, okay. You\u2019re \u2013 the Indian secretary of defense is ready, you\u2019re saying?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> No --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Our secretary, okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- yeah \u2013 two-plus-two, right, yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. I don\u2019t have any information for you on that. Obviously, we have a very strong relationship with Prime Minister Modi\u2019s government. We have strong, strong people-to-people ties with the Indian population, and so I know when we get a chance to schedule something on that \u2013 I know we\u2019re looking at the Secretary\u2019s schedule right now to see what he has on his plate and what we\u2019re going to schedule in the near future \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"PAKISTAN\"></a><b>QUESTION: </b>And second, madam, one strange thing is going on on Pakistani television is that former prime minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, he told the Pakistani television and \u2013 that Pakistan was behind the Mumbai attacks in India. Now, this also asserted that last year, General Musharraf said that Pakistan is favoring terrorism against India.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Say the last part again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>General Musharraf also said last year that Pakistan is supporting terrorism against India as far as Kashmir is concerned, and we are making it public that we will be supporting terrorism against India.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>And now it\u2019s the prime minister of Pakistan who just stepped down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, the only thing I can \u2013 I have to share with you about that in terms of the Mumbai attacks, and we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve addressed this on numerous occasions from this podium here, and those would be our concerns about the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. And he\u2019s a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba guy who was being held in Pakistan, and he was eventually let out on house arrest, and we have a reward out for \u2013 I believe it\u2019s for his arrest \u2013 not information leading to his arrest, but his arrest. I don\u2019t recall off the top of my head the award amount, but that person out in the open is a tremendous concern to the United States. In terms of your other question, I\u2019d just have to look into that for you. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you, madam.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAN2\"></a><b>QUESTION: </b>Just back to \u2013 just back to the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>-- and this new anti-Iran coalition that you\u2019re --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>No, I \u2013 let me correct you on that. It\u2019s not an anti-Iran coalition.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>(Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>We stand firmly behind the people of Iran and make a very significant distinction between the Iranian population \u2013 a very proud, historic population; a rich, incredible society \u2013 to what the Iranian regime is doing to its country. And when Iran pledged that it would bring some of its money back home \u2013 because they\u2019ve done quite well for themselves as a result of the JCPOA and businesses, as she mentioned earlier, coming into the Iranian marketplace \u2013 they\u2019ve done very little to share that money with their people and the overall economy, and people are frustrated with that, and they have a right to be angry with that. So this isn\u2019t an anti-Iran thing, this is the Iranian regime and the bad actions that it\u2019s doing, nothing with the Iranian people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Okay. I wasn\u2019t intending to mean that it was about the Iranian --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Whatever you\u2019re going to \u2013 what are you going to call the coalition, then?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I don\u2019t know, Matt. Do you have any suggestions?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>The anti-Iranian regime \u2013 I don\u2019t know, whatever it\u2019s being called, whatever it\u2019s going to be called.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay. Okay, I get your point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Even if it \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even going to have a name. Well, whatever. Do you \u2013 has --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Maybe a government acronym.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Has \u2013 yeah, (inaudible) --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019m sure it will be fabulous.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Maybe it could be called IRAN, I-R-A-N. You can figure out when it comes up \u2013 anyway, is there \u2013 been any interest in countries other than Israel and Saudi Arabia, the other gulf Arab states, in joining your coalition?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I can just tell you that in the Secretary\u2019s calls that he\u2019s had with his counterparts, they are fully understanding and appreciative of our concerns about Iran\u2019s malign activity. These are countries that understand that. They\u2019re not turning a blind eye to these things, and we continue to coordinate very closely with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Are you talking about the Europeans here?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Many countries, many countries, as we --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Has he spoken to Foreign Minister Lavrov at all since --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Not to my awareness, but I can look into that and see if we have anything for you on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>(Inaudible) coalition --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>But the point is \u2013 the point is, these countries around the world understand \u2013 no one is ignorant to all the bad stuff that the Iranian regime has been involved with. And countries have an interest in joining us because we have a lot more work that we can do together, and recognizing that Iran needs to be addressed in a more comprehensive fashion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>They do, but I\u2019m just wondering if you get this \u2013 if there is a high level of enthusiasm given the fact \u2013 for joining the U.S. given the fact that this administration has thus far not exactly been a joiner, but rather a withdrawer of international coalitions and \u2013 from international agreements and \u2013 so I\u2019m trying \u2013 just trying --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Well, that \u2013 that\u2019s kind of funny that you say that as the President was just hosting the NATO secretary general. That is an example of something that we stand firmly behind and continue to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Yeah, I get that, but the TPP, the climate accord, the Iran deal --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Look, I know that\u2019s a narrative that people would like to believe, but there were previous agreements --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>By \u2013 yes, okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>-- that the United States has made the decision, and this administration has made the decision that it\u2019s not in the best interests of the American people to do that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>When you talk about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I get it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>-- certain trade agreements \u2013 let me finish \u2013 when you talk about certain trade agreements, the President believes, and he firmly believes, that we can sometimes get a better deal when we conduct, when we develop bilateral trade agreements rather than these multilateral trade agreements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Understood, but other countries --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>That is a not a bad thing when we\u2019re looking out for the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m not saying it is. I\u2019m just saying, when other countries have \u2013 they have not been silent about their disappointment, anger, upset, whatever that the administration has removed the U.S. from these kinds of agreements. So I\u2019m just curious if you can gauge their \u2013 the level of interest in joining the U.S. in a new coalition that is aimed at --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I can just tell you we\u2019ve had conversations with them about it, they understand the threat that the Iranian regime poses, and we look forward to having more meetings and conversations with them along the way. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Would it include --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I\u2019ve got to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Would it include the Iranian groups like Mujahedin-e Khalq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Said, I have no information on that for you on that. Okay, thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(The briefing was concluded at 3:59 p.m.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDPB # 28\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients. You can applause. (Laughter.) (Applause.) We would like to welcome them into the room. (Applause.) And they have come a long, long way to get here to meet you in Washington. (Applause.)</span></span>\n\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to welcome First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump. Melania, Mrs. Trump, welcome. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Thank you, everyone, and welcome to the State Department. I am honored to welcome you to the 12th Annual Secretary of State\u2019s International Women of Courage Awards, which have recognized more than 120 remarkable women from dozens of countries since the award\u2019s inception. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>In addition to the privilege of being joined by the First Lady, I would also like to extend a special welcome to the members of the diplomatic corps in the audience, including Ambassador Callista Gingrich. Where is she? She\u2019s here somewhere. Thank you, there she is. Ambassador Gingrich, welcome. (Applause.) She joins us from the Vatican today and has been in Washington this week. It\u2019s wonderful to have you back here with us.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>We know that women\u2019s voices are critical to global security, prosperity, and peace, which is why the Department of State annually presents the International Women of Courage Awards. Each awardee\u2019s story is an inspiring reminder of how individuals can make a difference. Taken together, they provide a powerful message of courage and leadership. And you can read some of their profiles in your pamphlets that you have with you. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This year we have recognized 10 extraordinary women who have demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight day in and day out for what they believe. The formidable leaders include a former slave and anti-slavery activist, a human rights lawyer documenting abuse under the junta rule, a nun sheltering internally displaced people from violence, a writer, director, and producer who wrote scripts under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and a courageous advocate for the families of forcibly disappeared persons. We are so happy to have them here today.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States is proud to honors these leaders as part of our commitment to advancing the status of women and girls around the world. I want to take a moment to thank my colleagues in the Secretary\u2019s Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues for the work that they do to ensure that women\u2019s equality and empowerment are integrated into our U.S. foreign policy. Our GWI folks, thank you so much for bringing them all together. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>I\u2019d also like to recognize the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, whose people-to-people programs are a critical element of our diplomacy, including the International Visitor Leadership Program these women are about to embark on for the next two weeks, I believe, as they share their stories with audiences around the United States.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This commitment to women\u2019s empowerment is the reason that President Trump signed the Women, Peace, and Security Act into law last October. The new law affirms the United States commitment to expanding women\u2019s leadership on the issues of international peace and security, especially efforts to prevent conflict and atrocities, promote peace and counterterrorism, and also violent extremism. We know that when women are empowered, communities are safer and countries are more stable. We see that around the world every day.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Another way to ensure that women are empowered is by expanding economic access and opportunity. Reports show that if the world closed the gender gap in workforce participation, global GDP would increase by $28 trillion by the year 2025. That is precisely why President Trump galvanized the creation of the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Finance Initiative through a U.S. contribution of $50 million at the G20 Leaders Summit last summer. Along with contributions from international partners, the initiative has leveraged more than 340 million in support to help advance women\u2019s entrepreneurship around the globe.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>From day one, the Trump administration has been committed to empowering women. Women\u2019s empowerment is not only a basic fulfilment of human rights, but a strategic investment in our collective future. Women and girls must have the tools they need to succeed and the pathways that they seek opened. That includes a safe environment that promotes their health and also their education. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Whether at home or abroad, expanding opportunities for women and girls is a priority of this President for this administration. And today I\u2019m honored to introduce someone who plays a central role in this critical initiative. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>As a philanthropist and a humanitarian, the First Lady has been a driving force behind the administration\u2019s efforts to promote the empowerment of women and children in our society. Mrs. Trump has been an Honorary Chairwoman for the Boys\u2019 Club of New York for five consecutive years and in 2005 was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador for the American Red Cross. She helped launch the National Child Abuse Prevention Month in April of 2008 and has been a champion for the American Heart Association. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Her deep concern for issues affecting children continues. As First Lady she is focused on the challenges of what children are exposed to online through technology. And as a mom whose children are always trying to sneak her electronic devices, I thank you for your work on that. (Laughter.) A lot of us can relate to that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump works tirelessly to raise awareness of the damaging effects of opioids and the harmful effects that drugs can have on pregnant women, particularly on newborns who develop neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS. Mrs. Trump, the State Department has watched with a great deal of pride as you visited hospitals and women\u2019s groups around the country to draw attention to this. Thank you for that.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Mrs. Trump is a powerful voice promoting women\u2019s equality and improving the lives of women and girls around the world. Now please join me in welcoming the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Melania Trump. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The First Lady gives remarks.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Mrs. Trump. Thanks to all of you. As Mrs. Trump just discussed, courage takes many, many forms. This year, we are honored to recognize 10 extraordinary women who have dedicated and demonstrated not only courage and leadership, but a deep resolve to fight for what they believe in day in and day out. I\u2019d like to introduce you to these women.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>First, we have Roya Sadat. She\u2019s from Afghanistan. She is a writer, a producer, a film director. Ms. Sadat, she\u2019s over here. She is being honored for refusing to be silenced in her home country. She uses the arts to raise awareness of the brutal challenges facing women and girls, and despite threats to herself, her cast, and her crew, she\u2019s served as a pioneer for Afghanistan\u2019s cultural reawakening. In fact, she wrote her film, \u201cThree Dots,\u201d while keeping it a secret from the Taliban, and many of you will recall that entertainment was not allowed \u2013 music, films, all of that was not allowed under the Taliban. Congratulations to you. Thank you for your bravery. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next, from Honduras, we have Dr. Julissa Villanueva. She is the director of forensic medicine at the Honduras political \u2013 excuse me, public ministry. Dr. Villanueva is being honored for tackling pervasive violence against women, changing the face of criminal accountability through the use of scientific evidence, and facing down gang violence in the struggle to bring justice. Welcome and thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aliyah Khalaf Saleh. She\u2019s from Iraq. A humanitarian volunteer working to resist sectarian and radical ideology, Ms. Saleh is being honored for her bravery, her heroism, and her compassion in the wake of ISIS terror. She selflessly risked her own life to save others. In fact, she is credited with rescuing 58 young Iraqi military cadets who were ambushed by ISIS back in 2014. Imagine the bravery that takes for a woman in that country. It\u2019s really incredible. She risked her own life to save others, and working with all Iraqi communities as well as security forces. Congratulations. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Such tremendous bravery in this room.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Sister Maria Elena Berini. She\u2019s from Italy. She\u2019s a Sister of Charity of Saint (inaudible) Antide Thouret. She was born in Italy but works at a Catholic mission in the Central African Republic. Sister Maria Elena is being honored for her service to counter hatred, injustice, and war-related horrors. She has provided refuge to those internally displaced people by conflict; and her tireless work to bring peace in the Central African Republic. Thank you, Sister. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>And next I\u2019d like to introduce you to Aiman Umarova. She\u2019s from Kazakhstan. She is a lawyer, a human rights defender, a promoter of justice and other reforms. Ms. Umarova is being honored for improving laws to address violence against women and children, delivering justice in a number of landmark cases for rape victims, and her efforts in countering violent extremism despite the grave risks that she faces in Kazakhstan. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Dr. Feride Rushiti is from Kosovo. She\u2019s the founder and executive director of the Kosovo Center for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims. Dr. Rushiti is being honored for decades of advocacy on behalf of civilian victims of Kosovo\u2019s war, including rape survivors, and she\u2019s laid the groundwork for a legislative victory to support survivors of wartime sexual violence. Thank you, Doctor. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To Mauritania now. I would like to introduce you to L\u2019Malouma Said from Mauritania. She\u2019s a former slave and now a deputy member of parliament in Mauritania\u2019s National Assembly. That is incredible. (Applause.) Mrs. Said is being honored \u2013 wait here, Mrs. Said. (Laughter.) You can stay here. We\u2019re not done yet. Stay right there. Thank you. Mrs. Said is being honored for her relentless activism in the fight against slavery, including work in the country\u2019s most effective anti-slavery organization; perseverance and promotion of human rights and equality; and resolve in addressing a failing prison system in Mauritania. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Godelive Mukasarasi is from Rwanda. She\u2019s the founder and coordinator of an NGO dedicated to helping widows and orphans of the Rwandan genocide, and she is herself a survivor of that trauma. She is being honored for her instrumental role in bringing women\u2019s voices to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, leading to the first historic conviction of rape as a war crime. Thank you, ma\u2019am, for your courage. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Next, Sirikan Charoensiri is from Thailand. She is a lawyer and human rights defender and is being honored for fiercely standing up for human rights. She includes \u2013 this includes the rights to peaceful assembly and expression. During Thailand\u2019s military rule, she co-founded an organization to provide pro bono legal services to those who are facing politically motivated charges and overcoming unprecedented harassment and persecution. As a result of her advocacy, she now faces three sets of criminal charges for her work as a lawyer, and those charges include sedition. What a brave woman. Thank you.

Aura Elena Farfan in a human rights activist and an advocate for families of the forcibly disappeared during Guatemala\u2019s civil war in the 1960s and subsequent conflicts. Ms. Farfan is being honored for her 33 years of fearless leadership and enabling the prosecution of former military officers involved in extrajudicial killings. She has been an activist since her brother disappeared back in 1984. Since then, she\u2019s received death threats, and has even been kidnapped by armed assailants in her country. We recognize Ms. Farfan in absentia today, as she is not able to travel to Washington from Guatemala due to a current medical condition that she suffers.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>So please join me in thanking these women, welcoming these women to the United States, and I would like to introduce you to our next speaker. Please join me in giving a round of applause for this remarkable group of leaders, and it is my pleasure to introduce one of our women of courage, who will give remarks on behalf of the group, Godelive Mukasarasi from Rwanda. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS MUKASARASI:</b> Mrs. Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to stand here to tell you my joy and my gratitude for this acknowledgement of my work in Rwanda. As a committed activist, I have been fighting for the rights of women, victims of rape, and their children born of such rapes during the genocide against the Tutsis in 1993 and \u201994. Through an extensive therapy process to help heal them of their trauma and through active advocacy, the rape victims have become models of self-development and resilient citizens.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>During the genocide, one million innocent lives were lost and millions of survivors were affected by the trauma, left with physical and emotional wounds. Rape has been used as a war weapon. Tutsi women and girls raped, raped en masse, and some of them became pregnant or by the militia and soldiers of the former regime. A number of these women were infected with HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Some underwent genital mutilation. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Others were forced to marry the perpetrators as a price to escape death, therefore becoming sexual servants and captives. When the militias were defeated, the women returned to their families but were rejected and stigmatized by relatives for having been the spouse of a militia member or for being pregnant by them. They were told to abort or to walk away with their cursed pregnancy. Some of these women decided to abort or they have left their families to hide far away, protecting those babies who today are beautiful 24 year-old women and the men.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Even too, the Government of Rwanda has done everything to address the effect of the genocide, the cases of rape were kept silent, because speaking of sexual issues is taboo in Rwanda culture. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Breaking the silence of this crime, I started the SEVOTA organization in Taba in December 1994. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Before meeting SEVOTA organization, every woman thought she was alone and would remain humiliated. But when sharing their stories, they find out that they could decided to accept themselves and accept their children. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>After experiencing the SEVOTA healing session and receiving assistance, these Rwandan women decide to speak out against the rape and stood up to testify about them in the international criminal court of Rwanda. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These women \u2013 these women\u2019s advocacy persuaded the international community make rape punishable as a crime against humanity. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>These resilient women and young people are fully integrated in the community, undertaking income-producing activities, sustaining themselves, and preventing renewed trauma. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>However, there is the need for more attention, as many of them are living with post-traumatic effects such as HIV/AIDS, poverty, and a fragilized and wounded memory.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>This is why SEVOTA continues to advocate, to heal, and to participate in self-development program using different channel \u2013 different channel, such as the recent film \u201cThe Uncondemned,\u201d where Seraphine, Victoria, and Cecile played a key role in speaking out. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my profound gratitude toward those who have encouraged me, including the Government of Rwanda, which appoint me as one of the guardians of the social pacts, and the institution who have selected me for this prize. </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Finally, I would like to extend many thank you who have attended this ceremony, and most of all, my sincerest thanks to First Lady Mrs. Melania Trump, Acting Under Secretary Nauert, the Secretary Office for Global Women\u2019s Issues, and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span><b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you. Godelive, thank you so much. Please join me in a final round of applause for this remarkable group of women leaders. (Applause.) </span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>The United States will continue to work the advance \u2013 the rights of women and girls globally, well aware that when women do better, countries do better, families do better, we all do better. Mrs. Trump, thank you for your inspiring words and for being part of today\u2019s ceremony and our ceremony last year as well. This is certainly your passion, and we are so grateful to have you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>To the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees, thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do. Thank you for your bravery, for your commitment, especially in the face of adversity. We honor you and your work.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>At this time, I\u2019d like to ask the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Award recipients to please stand for a group photo together, and we\u2019ll get a picture together, and then we\u2019ll conclude our ceremonies.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage Awardees then depart. Let\u2019s take a picture first.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>(The picture is taken.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>Please remain seated while the First Lady and the 2018 International Women of Courage awardees depart. Thank you, ladies. (Applause.) And thanks to all of you for coming today. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<span><span>For those of us who are joining us in our reception, you are now invited to proceed to the Ben Franklin room, and that is on the eighth floor. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, our First Lady, and thank you to these wonderful ladies. Thank you. (Applause.)</span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>"

In particular, we would like to thank the survivors who responded to our Survivor Voices Survey during the drafting of this report to represent the voices of survivors around the country. We would also like to thank the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), community members, faith-based organizations, U.S. government agencies, philanthropists, and individuals who have played a significant role in the life of every survivor of human trafficking in the United States and around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe are thankful to the U.S. government agencies that dedicated time to meet with the Council in preparation of this report. This includes the Department of State (DOS), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Education (ED), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These agencies provided answers to our questions and shared materials for our review\u2014helping us move closer to achieving agency implementation of the recommendations in our <i>United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking Annual Report 2016</i>.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also would like to thank the regional federal offices and local government agencies, survivors, law enforcement officials, prosecutors, NGOs, and tribal communities in Minnesota and Washington State for meeting with us, as well as the Metropolitan State University for providing space to host our town hall meeting in Minnesota.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe are most grateful to the Department of State\u2019s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and ICF staff, for spending countless hours to support the Council.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, we would like to thank President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump, Members of Congress, and the White House staff for providing an honorable platform for survivors of human trafficking to contribute their expertise in the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"2\" name=\"2\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>ABOUT THE COUNCIL </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking is comprised of eleven survivor leaders who bring their expertise and experience to advise and provide recommendations to the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) to improve federal anti-trafficking policies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council was established on May 29, 2015 by section 115 of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA), Pub. L. 114-22, also known as the Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act, and in December 2015 then President Barack Obama appointed the eleven members of the Council, to:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Provide advice and recommendations to the U.S. government, specifically the Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG)<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> and the PITF, to strengthen federal policy and programming efforts that reflect best practices in the anti-trafficking field.</li>\n\t<li>Review federal U.S. government policy and programs intended to combat human trafficking, including programs relating to the provision of services for victims.</li>\n\t<li>Gather information from U.S. government agencies, states, and the community for the Council\u2019s annual report.</li>\n\t<li>Publish an annual report that contains the findings derived from reviews conducted of federal government policy and programs.</li>\n\t<li>Serve as a point of contact for federal agencies reaching out to human trafficking survivors for input on anti-trafficking programming and policies in the United States.</li>\n\t<li>Represent the diverse population of human trafficking survivors across the United States.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council brings expertise from members\u2019 personal experiences of human trafficking as well as members\u2019 ongoing work and leadership in various national, state, and local anti-trafficking efforts. The Council has organized itself into five committees to conduct its work: Rule of Law, Public Awareness, Victim Services, Labor Laws, and Grantmaking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, in drafting this report, the Council sought input from survivors across the nation through a Survivor Voices Survey to incorporate additional perspectives on what is needed in the anti-trafficking movement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMore information about the Council is available in the Addendum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i>Note to the White House: The U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking appreciates the efforts of the White House to combat human trafficking. We are grateful to Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump, and for her willingness to work with the Council and fellow survivors to eliminate human trafficking in the United States. We seek the support of the White House to continue to engage the voices of survivors and to compensate survivors for their time and expenses. We encourage the White House to support a provision included in H.R. 2200, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017, which will amend the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 to remove the prohibition on Council members receiving compensation, to require they be reimbursed for travel expenses, and to extend the existence of the Council.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<em><b>U.S. ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING</b></em>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Harold D\u2019Souza</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Council Co-Chair and Rule of Law Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tCo-Founder Eyes Open International; Consultant for the International Organization for Migration; and Member of the Global Sustainability Network\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Sheila White</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Council Co-Chair and Grantmaking Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tSurvivor Leadership Activist\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Bukola Love Oriola</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Council Secretary and Report Editor</i></strong><br>\n\tFounder, The Enitan Story and CEO, Bukola Oriola Group, LLC\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Evelyn Chumbow</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Public Awareness Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tSurvivor Activist Project Assistant, Baker McKenzie LLP Advisor, Human Trafficking Legal Center Board of Directors, Free the Slaves\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Minh Dang</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Protocols &amp; Procedures Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tPhD student, University of Nottingham and Executive Director, Survivor Alliance\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Tina Frundt</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Protocols &amp; Procedures and Rule of Law Committees</i></strong><br>\n\tExecutive Director, Courtney\u2019s House\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Ima Matul Maisaroh</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Grantmaking and Public Awareness Committees</i></strong><br>\n\tSurvivor Coordinator, Coalition to Abolish Slavery &amp; Trafficking (CAST)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Ronny Marty</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Labor Laws Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tIndependent Anti-Human Trafficking Consultant and CPA\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Flor Molina</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Victims Services Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tFounding member of the Coalition to Abolish Slavery &amp; Trafficking (CAST) Survivor Leadership Program\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Suamhirs Piraino-Guzman</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Victim Services Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tBehavioral Health Specialist and Senior Program Manager IRC, Washington Anti-Trafficking Response Network\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Shandra Woworuntu</b><br>\n\t<strong><i>Labor Laws Committee</i></strong><br>\n\tFounding Director, Mentari Human Trafficking Survivor Empowerment Program Inc., and Member of The Reference Group of the Alliance 8.7 Knowledge Platform\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"3\" name=\"3\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>ABOUT THE PRESIDENT\u2019S INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons was authorized by section 105(a) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Pub.

It is a violation of basic human rights. It is a social justice issue and exacts a significant social and economic toll on survivors and the community. Many have lost their lives; others struggle daily as they cope with the trauma of this heinous crime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is commendable to see the United States taking the lead among nations around the world, and continuing to place survivors in key positions, including as members of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking. Survivors play uniquely important roles in combating human trafficking effectively in the U.S. and around the world. As subject matter experts, they provide essential tools that investigators, prosecutors, and communities need to combat and prevent human trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt was encouraging to hear Ivanka Trump recognize the enormous value survivors of human trafficking bring to combat this crime when, at the release of the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2017 <i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i>, she stated: \u201chere in the United States, we have our own Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, comprised exclusively of survivors. We cannot meaningfully address this pervasive issue without the brave voice of survivors at the table. They can help us understand what they experienced and they will play a leading role in solving this pressing crisis.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis report acknowledges federal agencies\u2019 efforts to implement recommendations provided in the <i>United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking Annual Report 2016<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><b>[3]</b></a></i>, and includes key takeaways from the Council\u2019s two regional trips, and the work and structure the Council developed in the past year. It is our hope that federal agencies, state governments, NGOs, faith-based organizations, community members, corporate bodies, and philanthropists will continue to collaborate with survivors regardless of their gender, age, race, or sexual orientation to combat and prevent human trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking has worked tirelessly since the October 2016 release of our first report to further engage with federal agencies. The Council is particularly impressed that shortly after the release of its report, several agencies met with us to begin implementation. Over this year, we have also seen increased federal engagement with survivors in implementing these recommendations, as well as compensating other survivors for their time, expertise, and expenses. In addition to focusing on documenting the implementation efforts of the Council\u2019s recommendations in its 2016 report, this year\u2019s report includes calls to action, as well as a special note on survivor engagement and empowerment.\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\" width=\"200\">\n\t<thead>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tfoot>\n\t</tfoot>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s ideal for the response team to include advocates, including survivors, who are educated on both sex and labor trafficking (and other forms of violence like domestic violence) as well as victim-centered and trauma-informed approaches.\u201d\n\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\u2013 Holly Gibbs, CA\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n\t<b><em>WHAT IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING?</em><a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><b>[4]</b></a></b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Sex Trafficking </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen an adult engages in a commercial sex act, such as prostitution, as the result of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion or any combination of such means, that person is a victim of trafficking. Under such circumstances, perpetrators involved in recruiting, harboring, enticing, transporting, providing, obtaining, advertising, maintaining, patronizing, or soliciting a person for that purpose are guilty of federal sex trafficking of an adult. This is true even if the victim previously consented to engage in such activities.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Child Sex Trafficking: </b>When a minor (defined under federal law as a person under 18 years) is recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, advertised, maintained, patronized, or solicited to engage in a commercial sex act, proving force, fraud, or coercion is not required. The use of children in the commercial sex trade is prohibited both under U.S. law and by legislation in most countries around the world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Labor Trafficking </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLabor trafficking encompasses the range of activities \u2013 recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining \u2013 involved when a person uses force or physical threats; psychological coercion; abuse of the legal process; a scheme, plan, or pattern intended to hold a person in fear of serious harm; or other coercive means to compel someone to work. Once a person\u2019s labor is obtained by such means, the person\u2019s previous consent or effort to obtain employment with the trafficker does not preclude the person from being considered a victim, or the government from prosecuting the offender.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Bonded Labor or Debt Bondage: </b>U.S. law prohibits the use of a bond or debt as a form of coercion used to compel a person\u2019s labor. Some workers inherit debt, while others fall victim to traffickers or recruiters who unlawfully exploit an initial debt assumed as a condition of employment.</li>\n\t<li><b>Debt Bondage among Migrant Laborers: </b>Although contract violations and hazardous working conditions for migrant laborers do not necessarily constitute human trafficking, the burden of costs and debts on these laborers can contribute to a situation of debt bondage. Employment-based temporary work programs when the workers\u2019 legal status in the country is tied to the employer make it more difficult for workers to speak up and seek redress.</li>\n\t<li><b>Domestic Servitude: </b>In the case of domestic servitude, the circumstances of providing services in a residence create unique vulnerabilities. Domestic workplaces are often informal, connected to off-duty living quarters, and not shared with other workers. Such an environment, which often isolates domestic workers, is conducive to exploitation because authorities cannot inspect private homes as easily as formal workplaces.</li>\n\t<li><b>Forced Child Labor: </b>Although children may legally engage in certain forms of work, forms of slavery or slave-like practices \u2013 including the sale of children, forced or compulsory child labor, and debt bondage and serfdom of children \u2013 continue to exist as manifestations of human trafficking, despite legal prohibitions and widespread condemnation. U.S. law prohibits the importation of goods produced by forced labor, including forced child labor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Unlawful Recruitment or Use of Child Soldiers </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChild soldiering can be a manifestation of human trafficking when it involves the unlawful recruitment or use of children \u2013 through force, fraud, or coercion \u2013 by armed forces as combatants or to carry out support roles such as cooks, porters, messengers, medics, or guards. Perpetrators may be government forces, paramilitary organizations, or rebel groups. In addition to being recruited or used for combat or labor, some child soldiers are sexually exploited by armed groups.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"5\" name=\"5\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>RULE OF LAW</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Overview </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tConsistency, continuity, and improvement of human trafficking training by law enforcement agencies engaging, educating, and empowering officials with survivor input, feedback, and recommendations will help end modern slavery. Focusing on training the trainer, engaging survivors, and understanding all forms of human trafficking are crucial steps for law enforcement and federal agencies to move ahead in protecting victims and preventing human trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our first report, this Committee recommended:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>DOJ, DHS, DOL, DOI, and DOD improve training on all forms of human trafficking.</li>\n\t<li>DOJ, DHS, DOL, DOI, and DOD engage survivors as trainers for law enforcement investigators.</li>\n\t<li>Club Owners Against Sex Trafficking (COAST) program work with the Council to improve training.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, we focused on implementing aspects of each of our recommendations and prioritized working with DOD, DHS, DOJ, and members of COAST.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Implementation Efforts </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe would like to thank DOD, DHS, DOJ, and members of COAST for taking time to not only meet with us, but seek our input and ongoing support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, we met with DOD to discuss its training materials. DOD plans to collaborate with the Council in the future to update its Investigative Professionals Training.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDHS\u2019 Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) discussed its plans to develop long-range strategies to train federal, state, and local law enforcement about human trafficking with the Council. This may include a proposed train-the-trainer program on basic human trafficking awareness, as well as plans to consult with the DHS Blue Campaign as DHS addresses the needs for human trafficking awareness courses for specific industry professionals, such as those in the hospitality and banking industries. The Council and DHS Blue Campaign plan to collaborate on the future development of these advanced law enforcement trainings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also met with DOJ\u2019s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit (HTPU) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). The Council provided input for the development of HTPU\u2019s training videos for engaging survivors during investigations as well as content for future training material. HTPU agreed with many of our suggestions and plans to include survivor experts in training videos, which will focus on survivor-informed investigations and prosecutions. Council members collaborate on training, including investigative training, with local FBI field offices and requested to review FBI headquarters training materials. The Council was informed that as a matter of policy, the FBI does not turn over training material for review. FBI headquarters plans to connect with the Council in the future to discuss suggestions and tips regarding its human trafficking training.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council met with members of COAST and DHS\u2019 Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) to discuss outreach, training, and survivor participation in their efforts. The Council provided edits to HSI\u2019s training material used by COAST and HSI is incorporating those edits. We hope to work with HSI and COAST in the future to develop club-specific training material.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Call to Action </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe passion and purpose of the Council is to collaborate with law enforcement officials and federal agencies to engage survivors of human trafficking to end modern slavery. Listening, learning, and looking to human trafficking survivors will give hope, courage, and freedom to victims and strengthen agency efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe suggest that these efforts not only happen at a national level, but a regional and local level as well. We recommend federal agencies encourage state task forces and other multidisciplinary teams to engage with local survivors and increase collaboration among local law enforcement partners with survivors to develop and deliver training for criminal justice professionals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"6\" name=\"6\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>PUBLIC AWARENESS</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Overview </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council\u2019s Public Awareness Committee focuses on human trafficking public awareness and outreach materials.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our first report, this Committee recommended:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>All PITF agencies include a more diverse representation of survivors and represent all forms of trafficking in public awareness and outreach efforts.</li>\n\t<li>The SPOG Public Awareness and Outreach Committee agencies collaborate with survivors of human trafficking to increase efforts on prevention and identification.</li>\n\t<li>All PITF agencies\u2019 public awareness and outreach be trauma-informed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, this Committee decided to focus on its first and second recommendations and prioritized working with DOT and ED.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Implementation Efforts </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, we met with representatives from ED and DOT to review their public awareness materials. This included ED\u2019s <i>Human Trafficking in America\u2019s School Guide </i>(released in 2015)<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>, and the <i>Human Trafficking Framework for Instructional Programing in Schools </i>(released in 2017)<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">[6]</a>, as well as DOT\u2019s public awareness posters, and a PowerPoint training for transportation stakeholders. ED partners with schools and DOT partners with other organizations to develop their public awareness materials. We provided recommendations to both agencies to improve the development of their materials and are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with ED and DOT. We encouraged both agencies to ensure images for awareness materials reflect all forms of trafficking and represent various backgrounds and nationalities of both victims and traffickers. We also suggested DOT increase awareness about labor trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tED and the Council agreed to set up a formal process for the Council to provide feedback on materials. This process includes quarterly calls between ED and the Council to discuss ED\u2019s public awareness efforts, providing the Council an opportunity to share input. DOT has agreed to connect with the Council for possible participation if and when speaking requests are received at industry conferences or events. ED also recommended the Council connect with the DHS Blue Campaign to learn about its efforts to develop public awareness resources for schools and their stakeholders. When we met with the Blue Campaign, we were pleased to see they had created a toolkit for college and university students. We recommended that the toolkit be updated in the future to include as much information on labor trafficking as there is on sex trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Call to Action </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the development of public awareness materials and training curricula of all PITF agencies, the voices of survivors are often missing, and materials may focus only on one type of trafficking or one type of survivor background. We recommend all PITF agencies collaborate and share public awareness resources and materials with each other to improve their outreach efforts and their progress in implementing the Council\u2019s recommendations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"7\" name=\"7\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>VICTIM SERVICES</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Overview </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council\u2019s Victim Services Committee focuses on ensuring services to trafficking survivors are comprehensive, meet the needs of all victims, and empower survivors. We also work with federal agencies to make sure programs are trauma- and survivor-informed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our first report, this Committee recommended:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>DOJ, HHS, DOS, USAID, and DOL provide comprehensive services for all survivors of human trafficking.</li>\n\t<li>Establishment of housing preferences for survivors of human trafficking at the federal and local levels.</li>\n\t<li>DOJ and HHS anti-trafficking grantees use standardized screening questions developed with survivors\u2019 professional input.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, we focused on our second and third recommendations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Implementation Efforts </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council met with DOJ\u2019s Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), HUD, HHS\u2019 Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP), and DOJ\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) regarding a new national housing initiative to support human trafficking survivors. The agencies requested input from the Council on different housing assistance programs, partnerships with affordable housing providers, and challenges survivors experience in obtaining and maintaining long-term and permanent housing. We also shared guidance on the housing challenges experienced by foreign national victims. We are thankful for the opportunity to provide extensive feedback to the agencies as they develop this new initiative.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe met with DOJ OVC and HHS OTIP to discuss victim identification and make recommendations regarding the use of standardized screening questions. We shared with the agencies that victims often do not self-identify and may go undetected when the right questions are not asked by service providers and other professionals. DOJ OVC and HHS OTIP shared that they do not require their grantees to use a standardized tool at intake to allow for flexibility in screening approaches in a wide range of settings. However, they have made efforts to improve detection of human trafficking victims across all programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHHS OTIP requested that the Council review screening guidelines it is developing for adult victims encountered in the healthcare, behavioral health, public health, and social welfare settings. The Council provided feedback on the screening tool and shared that the length of the tool was appropriate and the content was clear and easy to follow. HHS OTIP is incorporating our feedback.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Call to Action </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe are grateful to HHS OTIP and DOJ OVC for meeting with us, sharing their efforts to identify victims, and soliciting our feedback. We recommend other relevant offices at HHS and DOJ solicit Council feedback on existing trafficking screening tools for victim identification.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe also continue to encourage all federal agencies to explore ways to ensure equal service provision to certain vulnerable victim populations, especially elderly survivors of human trafficking and survivors with disabilities. We recommend agencies require applicants to demonstrate their capacity to serve these special populations and reduce barriers to access created by mobility issues, disabilities, language, or reduced social and familial supports.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"8\" name=\"8\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>SURVIVOR ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSurvivor mentorship and empowerment are the keys to helping survivors with their reintegration into the community and society so they can truly be free and independent. Providing survivors with education, job training, and job placement are important elements to help survivors sustain their life. Also, encouraging and engaging survivors in their leadership capacity will help government and NGOs do better in their anti-trafficking work. This includes more support from federal, state, and local funders for survivor-led organizations that aid individual survivors as well as strengthening the voice of survivors in program implementation. It also includes connecting survivors with government agencies to inform the development of anti-trafficking policies and initiatives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council had an opportunity to engage survivors by sending out surveys in 2016 and 2017 to get their input, and on our regional trips to Minnesota and Washington State. For both trips we hosted roundtable meetings and discussions with survivors to share information about the Council\u2019s work and empower them to share recommendations that could be incorporated into our annual report. Survivors in both regions shared the importance of targeting services to under-served survivor populations, including tribal communities, the elderly, and adult women. They also recommended that federal and state government agencies support long-term services for survivors and work to address gaps in housing, employment, education, health, and mental health support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"9\" name=\"9\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>LABOR LAWS</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Overview </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council\u2019s Labor Laws Committee works together with agencies to help them improve their efforts, and has focused its work with DOL.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our first report, this Committee recommended:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>DOL collaborate with the Council to establish survivor-informed training.</li>\n\t<li>DOL Wage and Hour Division (WHD) increase investigations in the hospitality, agriculture, and construction industries to identify potential exploitation or human trafficking cases.</li>\n\t<li>DOL eliminate age requirements and background checks for all employment assistance programs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, we followed up with DOL on several aspects of our recommendations.\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"\" cellspacing=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n\t<thead>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tfoot>\n\t</tfoot>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\u201cWe need more awareness education in the schools and all of the business that traffickers use to promote and transport the victims, such as hotels, bus stations, airports, etc.\u201d\n\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\u2013 Delores Day, Wisconsin\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Implementation Efforts </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year we met with DOL staff in Washington, DC, as well as staff in the Seattle district office. We learned that DOL already undertakes specific enforcement initiatives in various industries, including in the hospitality, agriculture, and construction industries, and that the focus depends on each geographic region and the labor market. For example, Seattle\u2019s district office has investigated cases in the fishing industry. However, DOL has faced challenges in accessing remote areas with a limited number of investigators. DOL also conducts investigations in industries that often employ low income, seasonal, or temporary workers and refers potential human trafficking cases to law enforcement. Increasing awareness training and staff support can help better detect trafficking in these industries as well as prevent and protect workers from being exploited. To increase staff awareness, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act regulations include a requirement for training outreach workers to identify cases of human trafficking.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\">[7]</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn meetings with DOL WHD we learned about DOL\u2019s mandatory human trafficking training for all staff and contractors, as well as its human trafficking training specifically for DOL WHD investigators, which incorporate DHS\u2019 Blue Campaign materials. We encouraged DOL to use survivor trainers who are uniquely positioned to provide strategic guidance that will help increase the detection of trafficking in the workplace. The Council met with DHS and discussed Blue Campaign materials used by DOL and plans to provide feedback to DOL on those materials. In addition, while DOL\u2019s data on trafficking cases is limited, coordination with other federal agencies and organizations that focus on trafficking is critical to increase public awareness about this crime and to help DOL staff better detect trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile DOL does not have specific job readiness and job placement programs for survivors of trafficking, survivors can access employment programs that are provided for various populations such as the American Job Centers, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. We continue to encourage DOL to eliminate the need for background checks for employment programs as survivors may have convictions as a result of the crime committed against them. We also encouraged DOL to work with Congress to remove age requirements for all employment assistance programs. We have learned from survivors the challenges they face to enter job training programs and secure job placement because of their age or criminal backgrounds.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Call to Action </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recommend DOL continue to enforce the laws within its jurisdiction to protect vulnerable workers and to continue to refer potential trafficking cases to the appropriate authorities. Resources may be limited to equally investigate industries where exploitation occurs, but the Council also recommends increased monitoring and investigation on child labor exploitation that occurs in informal market places, with respect to begging, selling candy on the street, in family businesses, restaurants, and stores.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe further recommend:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>DOL partner with the Council to establish survivor-informed guidelines for DOL\u2019s investigation trainings.</li>\n\t<li>DOL work with partner agencies to develop a process to collect data on labor trafficking cases by region and industry to inform investigations as well as raise public awareness about the scope of labor trafficking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\tWe recognize DOL\u2019s efforts to protect workers from exploitation and human trafficking and we encourage increased collaboration across federal, regional, and local offices to enhance these efforts. We look forward to further partnering and collaborating with DOL to develop survivor-informed programs and trainings, especially in the detection and referral of potential trafficking cases.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"10\" name=\"10\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>GRANTMAKING </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Overview </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is important to document promising and innovative practices as the anti-trafficking movement grows in the United States and around the world. The Council\u2019s Grantmaking Committee focuses on government agencies that fund domestic and international anti-trafficking programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn our first report this Committee recommended:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>SPOG Grantmaking Committee agencies (DOS, DOJ, DOL, HHS, and USAID) provide funding for survivor leadership and empowerment.</li>\n\t<li>SPOG Grantmaking Committee agencies (DOS, DOJ, DOL, HHS, and USAID) collaborate with the Council to identify areas for survivor input in the grantmaking process.</li>\n\t<li>The SPOG Grantmaking Committee identify promising practices in anti-trafficking programming.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2017, this Committee decided to focus on implementation of its second and third recommendations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Implementation Efforts </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year we met with the SPOG Grantmaking Committee co-chairs from DOS, DOJ, and USAID. Based on the Council\u2019s recommendation in our first report, the SPOG Grantmaking Committee plans to develop a promising practices resource, similar to the <i>2012 Promising Practices, A Review of U.S. Government-Funded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Programs</i>, which can be regularly updated and maintained. This may allow agencies to identify gaps in evaluation and monitoring, begin to identify and develop best practices, and inform future funding allocations. The SPOG Grantmaking Committee will collaborate with and seek input from the Council on developing the promising practices resource to highlight innovative practices and programming around prevention, empowerment, and leadership of human trafficking survivors. The SPOG Grantmaking Committee\u2019s new promising practices resource should include the following topic areas:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Survivor-informed/survivor-led trainings, resources, and curricula</li>\n\t<li>Survivor economic empowerment tools and leadership development curricula</li>\n\t<li>Survivor collaboration and survivor partnerships</li>\n\t<li>Survivor-informed and culturally competent awareness materials</li>\n\t<li>Evaluation tools used to measure survivor-specific services and impact</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council also suggests the SPOG Grantmaking Committee broaden the scope of the \u201cPromising Practices\u201d document by adding sub-categories to the prevention, protection, and prosecution model, which could include survivor-informed outreach and public awareness materials/curricula and capacity-building specifically for survivor-led initiatives. It could also include specialized and trauma-specific services for survivors, survivor collaboration and partnerships, and measuring and monitoring impacts and outcomes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe SPOG Grantmaking Committee co-chairs also requested the Council\u2019s input on the grantmaking process to better inform agencies\u2019 efforts. The Council is developing guidelines that address what agencies should look for in grant solicitations and program designs and what to consider in monitoring and evaluation activities. The guidelines will offer suggestions that seek to avoid the re-exploitation of survivors. They may also offer a checklist on what to look for during performance review site visits and make recommendations to assess how programs empower survivors with needed services that build their economic self-sufficiency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Call to Action </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the SPOG Grantmaking Committee begins to develop a promising practices resource, some critical questions to consider include:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How are best practices and outcomes being documented?</li>\n\t<li>What information and/or curricula are currently being used for prevention and awareness internationally and domestically?</li>\n\t<li>What does survivor collaboration and survivor input look like within each federal agency?</li>\n\t<li>How is survivor input used and what is the process to incorporate survivor insight?</li>\n\t<li>What are the grant evaluation and monitoring processes for each federal agency?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council hopes to continue working with the SPOG Grantmaking Committee as closely as possible to implement the above suggestions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"11\" name=\"11\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>COUNCIL TRIPS TO MINNESOTA AND WASHINGTON STATE</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the first year of the Council\u2019s work, various organizations at the local and regional level reached out to the Council to learn more about our work. Consequently, during the Council\u2019s strategic planning retreat in February 2017, Council members identified two regional trips to pursue for the year. First, the Council selected the Midwest Region to maximize resources and support existing efforts of Council members. Second, the Council selected the Pacific Northwest because the Council does not have representation from this part of the country, or from tribal communities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Minnesota </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Goals and Objectives </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council\u2019s goals for this trip were to gather information, educate, empower, create awareness, and brainstorm about meaningful survivor engagement; meet with regional federal agency offices in Minnesota; and host a public event to raise awareness about human trafficking and survivor engagement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Meeting Overview </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council met with the University President and faculty at Metropolitan State University (MSU), members of the Minnesota Human Trafficking Task Force, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO), and the Minnesota Department of Health. We also met with county sheriffs and attorneys, local survivors, and NGOs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Key Findings and Takeaways </b>\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Educate Students and Faculty about Human Trafficking. </b>In meeting with leadership at MSU, we learned that while their anti-trafficking efforts are limited, there is great interest in bringing more attention to the issue for students and faculty. MSU is interested in becoming more trauma-informed and developing curricula and awareness materials on human trafficking, and committed to working with the Council to form a strategy to educate staff, faculty, and students.</li>\n\t<li><b>Reinforce Terminology about Human Trafficking. </b>Meetings with MSU, task force members, and law enforcement raised questions about how stakeholders speak about and define human trafficking. We heard phrases such as \u201chuman trafficking and sex trafficking\u201d or the use of the phrase \u201csex trafficking\u201d being referenced as the only form of trafficking. We encourage federal and state stakeholders to reinforce state and/or federal definitions of human trafficking, which include both sex and labor trafficking.</li>\n\t<li><b>Increase Capacity to Combat Labor Trafficking. </b>We also saw a strong focus among regional stakeholders on sex trafficking, particularly of minors, with less emphasis on investigation and prosecution of labor trafficking cases. We noted a demonstrated need for greater resources to support labor trafficking investigations. Also, stakeholders shared ongoing challenges related to the provision of Continued Presence, a form of short term immigration relief, noting difficulties in DHS\u2019 Homeland Security Investigations\u2019 willingness to request Continued Presence for survivors. The Council is encouraged by DHS\u2019 recent updates to its policy on Continued Presence. We recommend DHS continue to prioritize training for agents in the field on Continued Presence and ensure Special Agents consult with their field Victim Assistance Coordinator/Specialist for technical assistance on each Continued Presence request.</li>\n\t<li><b>Strengthen Local Services for Survivors. </b>In meeting with survivors and the Minnesota Department of Health, we heard about the importance of federal agencies supporting long-term programs and services for all survivors, especially those for adult women. They also expressed the need for services that do not have age limits and for culturally appropriate service programs.</li>\n\t<li><b>Increase Collaboration between Federal and Local Law Enforcement. </b>During meetings with task force members, including the FBI and local law enforcement, the Council learned about strong and replicable partnerships that have helped centralize information sharing and improve identification and prosecution efforts across state and federal efforts. Task force meetings are critical in encouraging these partnerships, as can be the co-location of a federal agent with local law enforcement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\t<i><u>Washington State </u></i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Goals and Objectives </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council\u2019s primary goal in visiting Washington State was to meet and connect with tribal communities and learn about their anti-trafficking efforts. Since there are no tribal members on the Council, we hoped to focus on outreach to tribal communities to enhance our recommendations to federal agencies. We wanted to learn the extent of trafficking in tribal communities and types of trafficking; challenges they face in providing services; gaps in services and/or training and education of staff and tribal leaders; and the types of collaborations they would like to see with the federal government to address human trafficking. Additional goals for the Washington trip were to hear from local survivors and solicit their recommendations, observe and learn about the work of federal agencies at the regional level, and learn about anti-trafficking efforts in Washington State.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Meeting Overview </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe met with the Tulalip and Muckleshoot Tribes. We convened survivors from the surrounding Seattle region to invite their feedback on a number of issues, including social service provision and the anti-trafficking movement at large. We met with the regional offices for HHS, DOL, DHS, and the USAO. Lastly, we met with NGOs and law enforcement officials of the Washington Advisory Committee on Trafficking (WashACT), the Ending Exploitation Collaborative, and the Washington State Department of Commerce, Office of Crime Victims Advocacy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Key Findings and Takeaways </b>\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Develop Resources for Tribal Communities. </b>The Tulalip and Muckleshoot Tribes are in the early stages of their anti-trafficking work, leveraging their existing services for children and domestic violence survivors. To expand their work, they are looking for resources that are tailored to, or focused specifically on, tribal communities.</li>\n\t<li><b>Collaborate with Tribal Communities to Collect Data. </b>Data about the incidence and prevalence of trafficking within reservations and tribal communities is needed to secure support among tribal leadership to address human trafficking as an issue of concern.</li>\n\t<li><b>Develop Long-Term Solutions for Housing, Education, and Employment for Survivors. </b>In meeting with local survivors, they shared how housing for adults over 25 and scholarships for survivors to pursue education are still lacking. Barriers to viable employment still persist, including lack of vacatur laws in all states. Survivors also requested that employers receive training on how to work with survivors. Long-term solutions also require support for survivor leadership and mentorship programs.</li>\n\t<li><b>Increase the Pool of Trauma-Informed Mental Health Providers. </b>Survivors often find it difficult to find private therapists who are trained to address trauma. In addition, interns or mental health trainees are often providing low-cost services but without the adequate training. We recommend institutions ensure mental health training programs are including curriculum about working with human trafficking survivors.</li>\n\t<li><b>Promote Collaboration to Ensure an Increase in Labor Trafficking Investigations and Prosecutions. </b>In Seattle, the WashACT task force receives funding from DOJ through the Enhanced Collaborative Model Program. DHS\u2019 Homeland Security Investigations takes a proactive approach to working closely with other members of this task force, including service providers, the Seattle Police Department, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, building a high degree of trust and collaboration between their offices. This has led to more investigations in labor trafficking industries than in many jurisdictions and we recommend replicating this example.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"12\" name=\"12\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>CONCLUSION</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe U.S Advisory Council on Human Trafficking encourages partnership and collaboration between government agencies, survivor-led organizations, and anti-trafficking organizations to empower, engage, and employ survivors who bring their experience and expertise to create better programs and anti-trafficking policies. We highly recommend federal agencies incorporate trauma-informed approaches, with survivor input, into their work implementing federal anti-trafficking policies and programs. We hope that our recommendations will be implemented by federal agencies through establishing national and global partnerships. Collaboration must be the foundation of our national efforts. We also hope that this report will provide an opportunity for collaboration between federal agencies and the next U.S. Advisory Council.\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"\" cellspacing=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n\t<thead>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tfoot>\n\t</tfoot>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\u201cSurvivors would benefit from housing, vocational opportunities, healthcare, trauma informed therapy, alternative therapy, and collaborative community networking to empower victims and survivors.\u201d\n\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\u2013 Angie Conn, WV\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n\t<a id=\"13\" name=\"13\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>\n\t<b>ADDENDUM ON PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Council developed and adopted protocols and procedures that guide our work.

This includes the use and recruitment of child soldiers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhere a person younger than 18 is induced to perform a commercial sex act, it is a crime regardless of whether there is any force, fraud, or coercion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Department of State\u2019s annual Trafficking in Persons Report, or TIP Report, examines what governments are doing on three fronts: prosecution, protection and prevention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Report assesses 187 countries and territories\u2013including the United States.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Department of State places each country onto one of four tiers based on the extent of the government\u2019s efforts to meet the \u201cminimum standards for the elimination of trafficking\u201d as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTier 1,\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTier 2;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTier 2 Watch List,\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tand Tier 3.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe TIP Report is the U.S. Government\u2019s principal diplomatic tool to engage foreign governments on human trafficking and the world\u2019s most comprehensive resource of governmental anti-trafficking efforts, and reflects the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to global leadership on this key human rights and law enforcement issue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt represents an updated, global look at the nature and scope of trafficking in persons and the broad range of government actions to confront and eliminate it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe TIP Office consists of four sections: The Reports and Political Affairs team engages with foreign governments on human trafficking and also prepares the annual TIP Report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe recommendations in this report inform the TIP Office\u2019s diplomatic engagement and drive its programming objectives for the following year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs team works with Congress, federal agencies, multilateral organizations, the media, NGOs, corporations, academia, and civil society to raise awareness about modern slavery and to build partnerships to help strengthen our efforts to fight it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Resource Management and Planning team provides management support to the TIP Office, including strategic planning, grants management, performance management, evaluation and oversight, and budget formulation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the International Programs team manages the Office\u2019s foreign assistance process and anti-trafficking projects, which we\u2019ll examine a bit in this video.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTIP Office programming supports our global engagement with foreign governments in the fight against human trafficking and builds partnerships with civil society and international organizations to combat modern slavery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe way we do this is through the \u201c3-P\u201d paradigm: prosecuting traffickers, protecting trafficking victims, and preventing trafficking in persons.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA fourth \u201cP,\u201d partnership, is also a critical element in the majority of our programs. Along with funding NGOs that offer services to trafficking victims, much of our anti-trafficking assistance goes to organizations that help partner governments build their own capacity to fight human trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast fiscal year, more than $64 million dollars of U.S. government foreign assistance was appropriated for international anti-trafficking programming. The TIP Office received approximately half of this foreign assistance to implement anti-trafficking programs in the form of grants and cooperative agreements. Additionally, another $25 million was appropriated to reduce the prevalence of modern slavery.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSome of these funds are directed by Congress to be used for specific purposes, while others can be used to fund projects in priority countries and regions identified by the TIP Office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs of 2017, the TIP Office currently manages more than $68 million dollars in foreign assistance to support more than 81 anti-trafficking projects worldwide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese projects are awarded in every region of the world, and the amount of funding within each region changes annually as new programming priorities emerge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe TIP Office has five main programming activities: The annual competition for grants is the primary means through which the Office allocates foreign assistance funds.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGrants and cooperative agreements awarded through this funding mechanism may be bilateral, regional, or global.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the annual competition for grants, funding is also available for short-term Training and Technical Assistance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese awards are intended to address specific knowledge gaps in host-country stakeholders, as identified by U.S. embassies, and are not competitively solicited.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are also the Emergency Victim Assistance Fund and Research and Innovation Fund, which, respectively, provide immediate assistance to vulnerable populations in emergency situations and collect data on trafficking trends.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Child Protection Compact Partnership is a program that aims to reduce child trafficking through a structured, multi-year plan developed jointly by the United States and a partner government. The first Child Protection Compact Partnership began in 2015 with the Government of Ghana. In 2016, the TIP Office also began Child Protection Compact Partnerships with the Government of the Philippines and the Government of Peru.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, the TIP Office awarded a new $25 million Program to End Modern Slavery, which aims to advance transformational programs and projects to achieve a measurable and substantial reduction of the prevalence of modern slavery in specific countries and regions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow that you know more about how the TIP Office works, let\u2019s move onto the annual competition for grants process.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhile the TIP Office has several funding opportunities available each year, this is the primary process by which our office provides anti-trafficking foreign assistance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut first, let\u2019s go over definitions:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA solicitation or notice of funding opportunity is an invitation to organizations to submit proposals for a specific purpose or mission.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA statement of interest (SOI) is a concept note submitted by a group seeking funding that describes planned activities for a specific outcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe first stage of the annual competitive grants process begins with our intra- and interagency Strategy Review Panels, which occurred in early September of this year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDuring this time, the TIP Office works closely with our Department of State, USAID, and Department of Labor colleagues to determine regional strategies for future programming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut how does the TIP Office formulate its programming priorities and objectives?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll programmatic decisions are guided by the recommendations in the most recent TIP Report, as well as by input provided by U.S. embassies around the world and other U.S. government agencies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tProgram objectives are also based on selected \u201cpriority\u201d countries ranked Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List, and Tier 3.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, there are exceptions and these are often determined by a host governments\u2019 political willingness to respond to the issue of human trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a general rule, we don\u2019t typically fund high income countries \u2013 as determined by the World Bank, using the measurement of gross national income per capita (also known as the Atlas method). The current threshold for high income countries is a gross national income per capita of $12,236 or more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe scope of human trafficking varies widely around the world, and program objectives must address the specific challenges in each of the identified priority region or countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNot all objectives apply to each location, and this is taken into consideration when drafting the strategies mentioned earlier.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOnce the programming priorities and objectives for each region and country are determined, we then post the annual solicitation requesting statements of interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, the annual solicitation was posted on October 13, 2017.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe TIP Office posts its call for proposals on GrantSolutions.gov , Grants.gov, and on the TIP Office\u2019s website.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe solicitation outlines the Office\u2019s specific programming priorities for the year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt also provides detailed instructions on how to submit statements of interest that meet ALL of the solicitation\u2019s technical requirements, including the necessary documentation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s important to note that statements of interest must be submitted through GrantSolutions.gov. This year while the funding opportunity will be posted to both GrantSolutions.gov and Grants.gov, we will only be accepting statements of interest through GrantSolutions.gov.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe TIP Office cannot, and will not, accept statements of interest submitted via email, mail, fax, or any other means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe solicitation will be posted for 30 days and all applicants must submit their statements of interest before the deadline of Monday, November 13<sup>th</sup> at 5:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf you encounter any technical issues, the Help Desk is available.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe annual competition for grants process is fair, transparent, and open to ALL organizations and institutions of higher education.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAny U.S. or foreign-based nongovernmental organization, public international organization, college or university, or for-profit organization can apply for a grant from our office.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOnce all statements of interest are received, each statement of interest goes through a two-stage review.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe first stage is the technical review \u2013 a brief, but thorough check to ensure all basic requirements, as detailed in the funding opportunity, have been met.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe technical requirements are listed in the solicitation. You should follow these carefully to avoid simple mistakes that will disqualify your statement of interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn its technical review, the TIP Office confirms whether:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe statement of interest is written in English?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe applicant requests an amount in U.S. dollars?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe statement of interest addresses AT LEAST ONE programming priority, as identified in the solicitation?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tEach statement of interest that passes the technical review is then reviewed by the TIP Office and other Department colleagues, including Regional Bureau officials and U.S. embassy staff.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDuring this rigorous assessment, the Office looks for:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA brief description of the organization\u2019s capacity and partner(s), including previous and current work in the country or region, if any; as well as prior and current work to combat human trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA description of how the project meets at least one of the TIP Office\u2019s programming objectives as described in the funding announcement is also required.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKeep in mind, statements of interest received for projects in countries or regions not identified in this solicitation or that do not address at least one project objective will be rejected automatically and will not be considered for funding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition, statements of interest that address more than one priority country or region in a single statement of interest will be rejected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA single statement of interest may address multiple project objectives, but cannot address more than one priority country or region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYour organization may submit separate statements of interest for any number of priority countries or regions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYour project description also needs to identify all intended beneficiaries, and include thoughtful and clearly-linked goals and objectives, the project\u2019s intended duration, and a sustainability plan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGoals and objectives mentioned in the website instructions are important to include, along with performance indicators, including outputs and outcomes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll these should demonstrate how your program would measure project objectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, be sure to include a brief overview of current and prospective funding for related projects in your statement of interest\u2019s intended priority country or region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf cost sharing is proposed, include the cost share amount in U.S. dollars and explain the source of the proposed cost-share.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNo other budget figures are requested or required at this stage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOnce again, all funding requests must be in U.S. dollars.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are a few additional points that can make your statement of interest stand out among the rest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYour statement of interest should be easy to read and understand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt should clearly link proposed activities to programming priorities and desired outputs and outcomes, while also demonstrating an understanding of the difference between an output and an outcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOrganizations must also demonstrate strong partnerships, whether by proposing to work with sub-grantees, partnering with other organizations in the area, or building local or national government buy-in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition, be sure to set realistic project targets and create a plan for monitoring and evaluating the project.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBe creative and innovative when designing activities\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tand ensure your statement of interest discusses how activities will not duplicate existing efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHundreds of organizations apply for funding from the TIP Office, so make sure your proposal stands out with experience and passion to combat trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tConsider and explain your organization\u2019s comparative advantage over other organizations working in the country or region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBe careful not to make simple mistakes that will disqualify your statement of interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, submitting your statement of interest late, or submitting an incomplete statement of interest, such as a statement that is missing required Standard Forms 424, 424A and 424B.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOr not submitting your statement of interest in English.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd, just quickly, here are screenshots of the SF424, SF424A, and SF424B so you know what they look like.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRemember, these three forms must be submitted to GrantSolutions.gov along with your three-page statement of interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPlease do not forget to include them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you for taking time to learn more about the TIP Office\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Grants Process Tutorial: Stage One - Request for Statements of Interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe hope it was informative, and we look forward to receiving your innovative anti-trafficking program ideas.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Welcome to the State Department. Do you see those two junior reporters in the back? Those are my kids. Hi, boys. Welcome to mommy\u2019s new job. (Laughter.) So that means you all have to try to be a little bit nice today, or at least keep it clean.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAll right. Good afternoon, everybody. I know we\u2019ve got a lot to get to today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> A blatant play for sympathy. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> No, I wish. This morning, Secretary Tillerson released the 17th installment of the Trafficking in Persons Report, also known as the TIP Report. To go into greater detail about that report today, we have with us Susan Coppedge, who is the ambassador-at-large to monitor and combat trafficking in persons. She\u2019ll join us in just a second.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Coppedge will deliver remarks and then take a few of your questions. If you\u2019d like to ask a question, just raise your hand, let her know which outlet you\u2019re with since she isn\u2019t here for you every day, and she can take your questions. So if you do have any questions about the TIP Report, please do ask those questions of her now so that she can best address them. When she\u2019s finished, then I\u2019ll take over and answer your questions about other matters at that time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ambassador Coppedge. Thank you so much for joining us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Let me move this for you so you don\u2019t have to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> Thank you. Good afternoon, although I\u2019ve lost all track of time today. It\u2019s been quite busy. Thank you, Heather. Thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis morning, Secretary Tillerson released the 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, a reflection of global leadership on this key human rights issue and our principal diagnostic tool to assess government efforts across the three Ps of prosecution, protection, and prevention.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe TIP Report is also a symbol of our moral and legal obligation to combat human trafficking and is in keeping with our country\u2019s historical commitment to advancing human dignity and freedom around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year\u2019s TIP Report \u2013 I brought a copy; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all want one \u2013 emphasizes that governments must do everything in their power to hold traffickers accountable, from passing and enforcing tough anti-trafficking laws to prosecuting complicit officials who betray the public trust and profit from the suffering of others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs the Secretary said this morning, the complicity and corruption that facilitates human trafficking must end. Justice must be served both to deter potential traffickers but also to restore the dignity of survivors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo accomplish this, governments needs to speed up the delivery of justice while respecting due process, impose adequate terms of imprisonment commensurate with the heinous nature of the crime, and prosecute all criminally culpable parties and intermediaries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTrafficking in persons is a hidden crime rooted in deception. Victims are coerced or intimidated into silence, and they often fear that if they do come forward they will be punished. When governments enact and enforce strong, comprehensive anti-trafficking laws, they send an unmistakable message to criminals: We will not tolerate this. Traffickers, not their victims, should and will face punishment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis morning, the Secretary highlighted some positive examples of government action to hold human traffickers accountable, and we commend these and other governments that take up difficult cases and prosecute them to the end. But with more than 20 million estimated trafficking victims globally, prosecutions are still inadequate given the scale of the problem, and we all have more work to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHere are a few quick statistics from this year\u2019s report. Of the 187 countries assessed under the minimum standards, 36 countries were placed on Tier One, 80 on Tier Two, 45 were placed on the Tier Two Watch List, and 23 countries were on Tier Three. In all, there were 21 downgrades, meaning a country moved down a level, and 27 upgrades.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut no matter the tier, every country, even those on Tier One, should do more to combat trafficking. Tier One countries only meet the minimum standards to address trafficking, which is why the TIP Report offers recommendations for Tier One countries as well as others.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA key concern for many countries is a failure to impose sentences for traffickers that are sufficient to deter the criminal activity or reflect the nature of the crime. We still see instances of government officials protecting brothels, taking bribes from traffickers, and obstructing investigations for profit, and while we still see governments criminalize and penalize victims for crimes their traffickers force them to commit.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis is why we continue to use the Trafficking in Persons Report as an instrument in diplomacy, a means to effect global change and motivate tangible progress around the world. We hope it will continue to prompt foreign governments to enact legislation, establish national action plans, and implement meaningful anti-trafficking policies and programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI am very proud of this report, and I am happy to take any questions you might have. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, yes, I\u2019m with Reuters. I wanted to ask about the Child Soldiers Prevention Act list. So Iraq and Burma were taken off the list this year, and Human Rights Watch put out a statement about an hour ago saying that as of \u2013 even as of last week there were children that were part of Burma\u2019s armed forces, and in Iraq children have died fighting the Islamic State along with Iraqi Government units, meaning that both of those governments are still complicit in the use of child soldiers. I\u2019m just wondering, what is the reasoning for taking those countries off the list?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> So the State Department will continue to monitor and report on the recruitment and use of child soldiers and will continue to engage the governments of Iraq and Burma on this issue. And in the report narrative, for example, for Iraq, we recognize that children remain highly vulnerable to forcible recruitment and use by armed groups, including ISIS, the Popular Mobilization Forces or PMF, tribal forces, and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. We are also concerned as well in the trafficking report about what happens to those children when they are recovered and make sure that governments continue to provide services for those individuals when they are released from military forces.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, with respect to Burma, we continue to remain concerned that that government\u2019s response to past instances of child soldiering \u2013 the government has punished some military officers who engaged in the unlawful recruitment of child soldiers, but these punishments were not sufficiently stringent. They were more administrative than they were criminal sanctions. And I was able to directly raise this point with the government officials while traveling to Burma in December.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe 2017 report urges the Burmese Government to cease official involvement in compelling civilians to perform any type of forced labor, to reform the military\u2019s self-reliance policy and others that drive the demand for forced labor, and to look at child soldier conscription, and then again, when children are removed from the military to work on reintegrating them into society. So the narratives for those countries accurately and factually report what happened in those countries during the reporting period which ended March 30th of 2017.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>But do you see any improvement? I mean, is there \u2013 what\u2019s the justification for then removing \u2013 if there are all these continued concerns, what\u2019s the justification for removing them from that list?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> So we look at various factors under the minimum standards when determining a tier ranking for those countries, and that analysis is reflected in the report. So certainly for these countries, we talk about areas where improvements need to be made, but Burma has made significant strides in removing children from military service.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. China obviously responded with some displeasure, calling it irresponsible. So what effect do you expect this to have on working with China on North Korea, and is it possible that it might actually have the opposite effect?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> Well, we have to continue working with all governments that are ranked in the report, and sometimes there is initial displeasure with that ranking. However, the report is seen worldwide as a real factual and accurate analysis of what\u2019s going on in countries such as China, and there are recommendations for China as there are for other ranked countries \u2013 Tier Two and Tier Two Watch List as well. And so all countries have recommendations, including the United States. We certainly look at ourselves as well and talk about areas where progress can be made and hope to continue those good working relationships diplomatically.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So what expectation do you have that this will be a positive pleasure \u2013 pressure that will spur them to act in the way that the U.S. wants them to do towards North Korea?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> So the Trafficking Victim Protection Act sets out these minimum standards and the analysis that officials in the State Department are to use, and this is done by people in the field at our embassies as well as here. So we don\u2019t consider whether it\u2019s going to be positive or negative. We want to be truthful and accurate, and we certainly hope to continue our diplomatic engagement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHistorically, we have heard that this report does make a difference. When I travel, I meet with senior government officials who want to do more to address this issue and want to do more to improve their ranking. And so I hope that internal pressure on a country as well as diplomatic pressure from other nations will continue to be an impetus for change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question on (inaudible)?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> What was it that \u2013 what was it that tipped the edge \u2013 tipped the edge for China? Because it\u2019s been on the Two Watch List for a while, and according to reports there was some pressure other years to put it down to three. Was it the North Korean forced labor? Because that\u2019s what Secretary Tillerson decided to emphasize in his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> Secretary Tillerson did highlight the concerns with forced labor with respect to North Korea, but there are other forced labor concerns in China as well. There have been NGO reports that indicate there is still government complicity with respect to drug rehabilitation facilities where individuals continue to be detained without judicial process. Human rights organizations and media continue to report that local officials in western China coerced Uighur men and women to participate in forced labor outside that province there. And then despite the local government issuing a decree in early 2017, that practice has not ceased. Last, international media and the ILO report that children in some work-study programs supported by local governments and schools are forced to work in factories. So forced labor in China is not one-dimensional.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more on China. I\u2019m Felicia Schwartz with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So in terms of just to follow up on Barbara\u2019s question, in terms of one thing tipping the scale, I guess. You listed several things that are of concern, but did one of them tip the scale? And then in general, was downgrading China part of a broader strategy on China or is this just happening in the context of this relationship without a connection?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>So it\u2019s hard to say that any one thing for any one country will tip the scale, because there are so many minimum standards we look at. We look at whether the law is comprehensive. In China, for children under 18, it appears that Chinese law does not require \u2013 or does require force, fraud, and coercion, which is an international standard for those over 18. Children under 18 who are placed in sex trafficking should automatically be viewed as victims, because they are not consenting based on their age. So there\u2019s a concern about the law there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere\u2019s a concern about victim services in China as well, that once individuals are identified they\u2019re not screened for trafficking indicators, they aren\u2019t provided the services they need, and they aren\u2019t assisted with reintegration into society. So there are many factors that go into any country\u2019s ultimate tier ranking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Question on child brides?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then anything about the broader relationship, about downgrading China this year to pressure them in any way?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>So the minimum standards that are in the law don\u2019t really allow for consideration of strategic relationships or other factors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I \u2013 question on child brides. My name\u2019s Said Arikat from <em>Al Quds</em> daily newspaper. About child brides, especially Syrian refugees on the side of the Jordan border in the Zaatari camp in particular and in Lebanon as well, where girls as young as 13 and 14 are married off to wealthy, middle-aged men from the Gulf region and so on. And it seems to be sanctioned by both the Jordanian Government or the Lebanese Government and the clerics. I wonder what you\u2019re doing about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>Certainly if there\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>And the UN.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>Certainly if there are instances of sex trafficking with respect to forced marriage, that is recounted in the report. Forced marriage is one of those truly horrible issues that may not, however, always be trafficking. It can be that you\u2019re forced into marriage without the continued exploitation via force, fraud, and coercion. But we do look at forced marriage as a component of sex trafficking in cases where it\u2019s indicated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Patty Culhane, Al Jazeera English. What will be the real-world impact of China being put in this tier? Will the \u2013 sanctions, cultural programs \u2013 how will we see an impact?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>So there are restrictions that can come with a Tier Three ranking. We have a 90-day process to put that into place and the White House makes the final determination on those restrictions, so we don\u2019t yet know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Are you aware of any time that sanctions have been imposed, that a president since \u2013 has imposed sanctions on a country for being in Tier Three?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>I\u2019ve been in the office for two years, and last year there were partial restrictions that were imposed is my understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On which countries?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>I can\u2019t recall right now. We can get back to you on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I\u2019m with <em>The Washington Post</em>. Some of the human rights groups have said that some of the current policies, such as putting an end to sanctuary cities, might make it more difficult for the U.S. to remain on Tier One next year. Is \u2013 I\u2019m just pulling that one out, just to be straightforward about it. Is that a realistic possibility, that something like ending sanctuary cities could cause the U.S. ranking to take a hit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>So one of the vulnerabilities that the report addresses worldwide is individuals who are in a country unlawfully and may not have access to documentation or lawful work. That then makes them more vulnerable to traffickers, who can then impose upon them work requirements that could lead to forced labor and labor trafficking. And so it certainly is a concern globally how to address and how to screen for indicators among those who might not be in a country lawfully to see if they are, in fact, victims of trafficking.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd here in the U.S., if that is found to be the case, that someone is here unlawfully but is a victim of trafficking, they are allowed to apply for a T visa, and that T visa allows them to stay and work with the prosecution in their case and to move forward. And one of the messages while I have been in this office is \u2013 has been that we really need to focus on not criminalizing victims who are committing crimes due to the situation of being trafficked \u2013 for example, the trafficker brings them across the border or the trafficker puts them into employment or the trafficker puts them into prostitution. These are crimes in this country, but the victim is not the one perpetrating the crime, it\u2019s the trafficker.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Last question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> This may be a question for DHS, but how \u2013 if you\u2019ve been deported, how do you apply for a T visa?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>You can still apply for a T visa with the Department of Homeland Security. In fact, I had a victim in a trafficking case who was back in Central America, and we needed to bring her here to testify, and she received a T visa for that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who had been deported for being here illegally?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>She had been deported. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And she has come back and testified?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>She did. She was able to obtain a T visa from abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So last year, China actually was given a waiver to stay on the Tier Two Watch List. Can you speak a little bit to whether that was considered in this particular year or kind of generally speaking how the department considers whether or not to issue a waiver?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>Sure. So for two years, a country can be on the Watch List without a waiver. And then for two years a waiver is required to remain on the Watch List. And to be eligible for that waiver, a country must submit a national action plan that if it were fully funded would lead toward significant efforts to eliminate trafficking. So that decision is made every year that a country needs that waiver.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it didn\u2019t impact this year\u2019s decision. We analyzed the minimum standards and made a determination that China was not making significant efforts and therefore belonged on Tier Three.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they issue an action plan or send you an action plan, China specifically?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>I don\u2019t recall.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thanks, everybody.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> That\u2019s all the ambassador has time for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR COPPEDGE: </strong>Thank you all.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

Thank you so much for coming, especially on a Friday. Today the State Department released the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Promoting freedom \u2013 promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms are central to who we are as a country, and the United States will continue to support those around the world struggling for human dignity and liberty.\n\n\n<p>\n\tThis is the 42nd annual Human Rights Report that the department has now released. We\u2019re delighted to have our Acting Secretary of State, John Sullivan, with us here today to say a few words about this report. After Acting Secretary Sullivan\u2019s remarks, we will invite Ambassador Michael Kozak to the podium to answer some of your questions. I will help facilitate, as we all know one another, and assist with that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Kozak is a senior bureau official with the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and he\u2019s looking forward to speaking with you shortly. He has served this department under Republican and Democrat administrations for 46 years, which is incredible. Sir, thank you for your service to the State Department.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will hand over the podium to our Acting Secretary John Sullivan. Sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>ACTING SECRETARY SULLIVAN: </strong>Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s an honor to be here to formally release the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper\">2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a>. Now in their 42nd year, these reports are a natural outgrowth of our values as Americans. The founding documents of our country speak to unalienable rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law \u2013 revolutionary concepts at the time of our founding that are now woven into the fabric of America and its interests both at home and abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPromoting human rights and the idea that every person has inherent dignity is a core element of this administration\u2019s foreign policy. It also strengthens U.S. national security by fostering greater peace, stability, and prosperity around the world. The Human Rights Reports are the most comprehensive and factual accounting of the global state of human rights. They help our government and others formulate policies and encourage both friends and foes to respect the dignity of all individuals without discrimination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis year, we have sharpened the focus of the report to be more responsive to statutory reporting requirements and more focused on government action or inaction with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights. For example, each executive summary includes a paragraph to note the most egregious abuses that occurred in a particular country, including those against women, LGBTI persons, persons with disabilities, indigenous persons, and members of religious minorities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBefore I turn the podium over to Mike, I\u2019d like to discuss a few countries in particular, including some with the most egregious human rights records.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe entire world is aware of the horrendous human rights abuses in Syria, including barrel bombing of civilians, attacks on hospitals, widespread reports of rape and abuse by Syrian Government personnel. A week ago, the President took action, together with our French and British allies, to deter the use of chemical weapons and protect the human rights of Syrian civilians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe condemn the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Burma and the atrocities committed against them, and we are working with partners to address that crisis. More than 670,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in recent months. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been internally displaced. Those responsible for the violations, abuses, and attacks must be held accountable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe DPRK is one of the most repressive and abusive regimes in the world. As the report makes clear, the Kim regime systematically neglects the well-being of its people to underwrite and fund its illicit weapons programs via forced labor, child labor, and the export of North Korean workers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina continues to spread the worst features of its authoritarian system, including restrictions on activists, civil society, freedom of expression, and the use of arbitrary surveillance. The absence of an independent judiciary, the government\u2019s crackdown in independent lawyers, and tight controls on information undermine the rule of law. We\u2019re particularly concerned about the efforts of Chinese authorities to eliminate the religious, linguistic, and cultural identities of Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists, as well as restrictions on the worship of Christians.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian people continue to suffer at the hands of their leaders. The right of peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression are the legitimate expectation of all individuals worldwide. Unfortunately for the Iranian people, these human rights are under attack almost daily.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Turkey, the detention of tens of thousands of individuals, including journalists and academics, under an ongoing state of emergency has undermined the rule of law there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Venezuela, the Maduro regime represses the human rights of its people and denies them the right to have a voice in their government. Thousands flee their homes daily in response to this growing humanitarian crisis. At the Summit of the Americas last week, Vice President Pence announced $16 million in humanitarian aid from the United States to help those who have fled Venezuela, are in \u2013 and are in desperate need of food, water, and medical help. We stand by the Venezuelan people even as their leaders refuse to allow aid into the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFinally, the Russian Government continues to quash dissent and civil society, even while it invades its neighbors and undermines the sovereignty of Western nations. We once again urge Russia to end its brutal occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, to halt the abuses perpetrated by Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and to address impunity for the human rights violations and abuses in the Republic of Chechnya.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat\u2019s a brief overview of the factual reports on countries of most concern. I know that Ambassador Kozak will be happy to answer any questions you may have, but before I turn the podium over to him, let me note at least a few bright spots.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUzbekistan \u2013 although there\u2019s still much progress to be made, the country has pursued a strategic reform agenda with positive effects on human rights, including the release of eight high-profile prisoners last year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Liberia, the recent presidential election represents a milestone marking the first peaceful transition from one democratically elected leader to another in more than 70 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Mexico, the general law on forced disappearances established criminal penalties for persons convicted of forced disappearance and a national framework to find victims.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese represent a few of the more positive examples noted in the reports which are released today. We hope to see many more positive accounts of countries taking serious action to improve the human rights record in the reports next year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn conclusion, let me say America leads the way globally to promote human rights. We will also continue to impose consequences on those who abuse human rights. Over the past year, through the Russia Magnitsky and Global Magnitsky sanctions programs, we have undertaken some of our most aggressive measures yet. No human rights abuser, no matter where in the world, is out of our reach. The Human Rights Reports are a significant part of that overall effort. Creating them is an enormous undertaking and not for the fainthearted. I\u2019m grateful to so many of my colleagues in the State Department, including those here in Washington and many others in embassies and consulates around the world, who\u2019ve made these reports possible and contribute to America\u2019s longstanding leadership in promoting human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\u2019d like to turn the podium over to Acting Under Secretary Nauert and to my friend and colleague, Ambassador Mike Kozak. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

So thank you very much. One second. Sir, come on up. Thank you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s start our first question with the Associated Press\u2019s Matt Lee.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. I realize that this report doesn\u2019t cover the United States and \u2013 but in this preface and in his comments just now, Acting Secretary Sullivan talked about how the U.S. is promoting \u2013 promotes and defends rights, and that that\u2019s central to us as a country, and that the United States will lead other nations by example in promoting rule of law and respect for human rights.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019m just wondering how effective you think that you can be in leading by example when you take \u2013 you accuse numerous \u2013 there \u2013 a lot of countries of, say, assaults on press freedom when here, in this country, we have a President who routinely excoriates the press, calling individual media outlets \u2013 and individual reporters sometimes \u2013 fake news. I\u2019m wondering how you can criticize countries for discrimination against LGBT people when this administration\u2019s stated policy is to exclude transgender people from serving in the military. I\u2019m wondering about discrimination of \u2013 criticism of other countries for discriminating against religious minorities when courts and a lot of critics see the travel ban as, in fact, a ban on one particular religion. And lastly, you criticize countries for the mistreatment and refoulement of refugees, which I suppose this administration is not in that great of a position to do because it doesn\u2019t accept hardly any refugees, or at least far fewer than it ever did before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo how is this not \u2013 how do you not open yourself up to charges of hypocrisy, and how effective do you think you can be at leading by example? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay, let\u2019s see if I can remember each one of those. But I think as you go through the report, you\u2019ll see the countries that we criticize for limiting press freedom, it\u2019s for things like having criminal libel laws where you can be put in jail for what you say. It\u2019s for things like yanking the licenses of media outlets you don\u2019t like or, in many cases, killing the journalists. So I think we make quite a distinction between political leaders being able to speak out and say that that story was not accurate or using even stronger words sometimes, and using state power to prevent the journalists from continuing to do their work. So I think there\u2019s an example there, and we\u2019ve used that with many of our colleagues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe other end of your stream was refoulement, which is a legal term. It\u2019s sending somebody back to a place where they are \u2013 where you know they\u2019re going to be persecuted or where they have a well-founded fear of persecution without going through due process to assess the risk to them. And of course, our law provides that people have rights of appeal through the immigration courts system and into the federal courts if they think they\u2019re going to be. So it doesn\u2019t go to the quantity of refugees; it goes to whether you\u2019re --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, I understand. But you\u2019re not in a position if you even wanted to refoule a refugee, you don\u2019t have many to do it to. But it\u2019s also mistreatment of refugees. It\u2019s not just that. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah, and that usually involves, as you\u2019ll find documented in many countries in the report, physical mistreatment of refugees and that kind of thing. Your --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> LGBT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> LGBT. As we are very clear in the reports, and this has been U.S. policy for some time, the things we\u2019re focused on are is: Has the government in question criminalized same-sex sexual activity, and that\u2019s highlighted now right up front in the reports; have they failed to prevent violence against people because of their LGBT status, or the same applies to ethnic groups and religious and so on; and then, third, discrimination in housing, employment, and government services. Usually, military and police are a slightly different form of government employment. So you can have a debate about that one, but most of the other countries where we\u2019re criticizing them, I think we would be very happy if they were following the procedures we are.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of policy decisions in these areas that governments make that aren\u2019t internationally recognized human rights, so that\u2019s where we try to distinguish. And that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s nothing new. That\u2019s been the case in the last couple of administrations as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michelle from CNN.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> I\u2019d like to know if you think that such statements in the United States weaken the impact of this report, because the American President has called the press an enemy of the people. And I think at one point he called for a closer look at libel laws or something like that. Do you think in the eyes of people that are looking at this report, as an example and as a resource, do statements like that currently weaken its impact?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think the report is very clear about the kinds of things that we consider to be inappropriate restrictions on freedom of the media \u2013 as I mentioned, using the legal system to go after members of the press, using physical force and so on. It doesn\u2019t go to the nature of discourse in a country. And you can have your own judgments as to how \u2013 how strong a statement might or might not be, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have a hard time explaining that in a lot of places. When you talk to some of my friends in Cuba, for example, who try to be independent journalists there and are routinely slapped around, they also get called names, but they \u2013 I think if it were limited to that they\u2019d be pretty happy as compared to the situation now. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when the State Department is talking about this represents our values as Americans, the removal of sections on women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 why is that not included in values as Americans?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> There\u2019s still a long section on women. And by the way, if you look elsewhere in the report, I mean, women are also activists, are also journalists. There are \u2013 yeah, now --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Understood. But it\u2019s so conspicuous that it\u2019s removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Let me \u2013 now, it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to explain why it was removed. It was introduced six years ago into the report. It hadn\u2019t been there before. The \u2013 it\u2019s one of the few terms that are used in the report that isn\u2019t derived from an international treaty that has a definition or derived from U.S. law, where there\u2019s a clear definition to the term.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in this case, the previous administration intended it to mean look at the availability of contraception, at the \u2013 whether the government tried to impose or coerce people in making decisions about reproduction. In the statements that were made \u2013 this was derived from the Beijing Declaration that was done in the \u201890s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAt that time, it was very clear and our delegation made a very clear statement that this has nothing to do with abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion, it doesn\u2019t mean abortion. Unfortunately, over the last few years, groups on both sides of that issue domestically have started to use the term, and both seem to think it does include abortion and then argue about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo our thought was let\u2019s just not use a term that has the opposite meaning from the one we intend. We went back to the term that\u2019s used in the U.S. statute that requires the Human Rights Report, which is coerced family planning, namely coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI might mention too, because I went back and looked at last year\u2019s report, the question being asked was, \u201cWere there obstacles opposed to getting contraception information and means?\u201d The answer in virtually every country was no, there were no obstacles other than, in almost every country, including our own, the availability in rural areas is less than it is in urban areas. But we were taking a lot of space to explain that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve kept that information in there. We\u2019ve done it now by a hyperlink. We used to take that information from the WHO report and put it in. We said let\u2019s just use a hyperlink, and then there\u2019s actually more information available that way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo that\u2019s the rationale behind that. It\u2019s not a diminishment of women\u2019s rights or a desire to get away from it; it was to stop using a term that has several different meanings that are not all the ones we intend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Okay. Dave Clark from AFP.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you very much. When countries around the world are looking at the U.S. for leadership on human rights, should they be looking at this report, or should they be looking at President Trump\u2019s embrace of Rodrigo Duterte, of meeting with Sisi, and with the very warm relations with Mohammed bin Salman, who runs a country where women have no rights at all? Is \u2013 what sends the stronger signal, the President\u2019s close personal friendship with Xi Jinping and his golf tours at Mar-a-Lago or you at that podium decrying human rights abuses?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, this is a official report, and by the way, I think it\u2019s one of the most widely read U.S. Government documents in the world when we do the hit counts on the internet. It\u2019s put out in the name of the Secretary of State, who was just here to deliver it, and he certainly is reflecting the President in this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think this is showing what we assess to be the human rights situation in all of the countries you\u2019ve just mentioned, including \u2013 now even more so \u2013 the responsibility of the government for the abuses that are occurring there. They\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not just saying there are these societal problems in the country; we\u2019re saying the government either has done these bad deeds or not. And I\u2019ll give you some examples.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Russia we highlighted the fact \u2013 their response to an increase in domestic violence there \u2013 and they have a terrible problem, I mean tens of thousands of deaths of women being killed in domestic disputes every year. But since it went up, the government spokesman who went into the State Duma said, \u201cWell, we have to decriminalize this, because it\u2019s better that our women be beaten than that our men be humiliated by their behavior.\u201d So \u2013 and this was Putin\u2019s party, they decriminalized spousal beating. So not a very good thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, does that mean that the President should never speak to these people? This is what \u2013 we\u2019re trying to keep the report as the factual baseline for what we\u2019re going to do in policy terms or sanctions as the secretary was mentioning. So we can learn a lot from this, and we can use it to formulate a policy. But usually part of your policy is engaging with the people whose behavior you\u2019re trying to change at some level. And I don\u2019t think those two things are in distinction. The fact is, these other governments and their populations do read the report, and I don\u2019t think they discount it because the President speaks with their leader or otherwise. And when the President speaks to their leader, often he\u2019s talking about these issues, so it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s complementary, it\u2019s not a \u2013 two things that are in conflict\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Since we\u2019re citing examples, what does Saudi law say about spousal abuse?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Saudi law is very, very restrictive on women. We\u2019ve tried to encourage changes in that, we\u2019ve seen the minor changes that are reflected in the report, that they\u2019ve started to say they\u2019re going to allow women to drive cars and so on. That isn\u2019t very much, but it is a baby step in the right direction, and we\u2019re trying to encourage more of that kind of reform at the same time that we\u2019re calling out the areas in which they\u2019re deficient, which are many.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>All right, Rich Hudson from Fox News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks, Heather. Ambassador, I want to follow up a little bit on Saudi Arabia, the conversation you were just having with Dave. You note in the report \u2013 and a lot has happened on the government level in Saudi Arabia in just the past year, and you note in the report the jailing or hoteling of 200 officials there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Yep. Hoteling, that\u2019s a good \u2013 (laughter).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are you \u2013 overall, in Saudi Arabia, are you encouraged by some of the things that are happening? Are you discouraged by what\u2019s happened over the last year? Where do you see the trend going in Saudi Arabia?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, of course it\u2019s always hard to predict trends, but I think \u2013 I\u2019m always encouraged when you start to see things break out of a static holding pattern. When you see a little bit of change as we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia, and the hoteling was connected to \u2013 ostensibly anyway \u2013 to more of concern about corruption, which is not \u2013 another one of our issues, insofar as corruption and human rights abuse seem to \u2013 tend to go together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re trying to encourage that kind of movement on the part of the Saudis. At the same time, you can look at that and say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t do this with sufficient due process,\u201d and I think that\u2019s also well spelled-out here. So it\u2019s trying to get that right balance of, hey here\u2019s where we think you\u2019re deficient, but we\u2019re seeing some movement and we\u2019re trying to encourage the movement in the positive direction and see more. But I\u2019m usually more encouraged when I see some movement going on than when things are just stuck in the same rut for years and years and years. So in that sense, at least there\u2019s an opportunity there. We\u2019ll see if it comes to anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>So is hoteling now going to be standard language in --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>I think your colleague just came up with a new term with --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Cindy with Voice of America. We have a few minutes left.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, thank you. We were talking about press freedoms, and you\u2019re probably aware that in Nicaragua, the Ortega Government ordered at least five television stations off the air for their coverage of massive protests. What is the U.S. Government prepared to do to stem this new wave of repression?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </strong>Well, Nicaragua is \u2013 and I think if you looked at the report \u2013 is going to wrong direction on many fronts and that is one of them, of media freedom. But also on all the basics, I mean, it\u2019s a long litany of torture, extrajudicial killing, the elections were a sham. And so we\u2019ve put more and more pressure on \u2013 I think you\u2019ll see some of the sanctions programs will start to affect some people in that country. But it\u2019s a tough one; the Ortega Government has basically shut down a lot of the opposition, a lot of the independent civil society organizations as well as the free media.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I mean, in our policy everywhere, and certainly in Nicaragua, is to try to provide both moral \u2013 and to the extent we can support NGOs and so on that are working to keep \u2013 to help them keep working, help free media keep working, and bring about a change in that dimension. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s tough, but we can\u2019t do it ourselves. We have to be in a position of supporting the people in those countries that are trying to bring about change, and we try to do that through a variety of means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he met with any Nicaraguans \u2013 but at the Summit of the Americas had meetings with civil society activists from Cuba, Venezuela \u2013 same camp as Nicaragua \u2013 and it was in part just to give them that \u2013 show that we stand with them and that we\u2019re trying to be supportive of what they\u2019re trying to do to bring about change in their own country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question about Gaza and --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Janne. Janne, go right \u2013 excuse me, Janne, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korean human rights issues, as the North Korean nuclear issue is an important issue and the North Korean human rights is also serious issues, unless the regime of the North Korean Kim Jong-un changes, the North Korean human rights abuse against the North Korean people will continue. What is the U.S. solutions on this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Okay. We have \u2013 I mean, we are concerned about the nuclear issue in North Korea, but we\u2019re equally concerned about the human rights issues, and they both derive from the same problem. And I think you see in the report we\u2019ve laid out pretty starkly the kinds of abuses, and over the last year or two, we\u2019ve supported, like, a commission of inquiry on North Korea, we support NGOs that are working on North Korea and exposing the human rights abuses that occur in the camps there and so on. But some of the stories that are contained in the report are just overwhelming. There\u2019s one about 11 people who were arrested for supposedly making a pornographic film and they were executed by shooting anti-artillery weapons at them, and then they brought out tanks and ran over the bodies, and this is supposed to be a civilized country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I don\u2019t think you will see a diminishment in our concern about that issue even as we try to work the nuclear issue. It\u2019s not a trade-off. I think the President\u2019s laid out a vision there that North Korea can get on a much better path, but it needs to make progress across the board, not just on one issue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Michel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, thank you. Sir, you \u2013 the report considers China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea forces of instability. What do you mean by that? And will there be any consequences?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve called them as forces of instability in the report. Perhaps --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, in the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> In the preface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> In the preface. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, exactly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> Well, I think that has to do with their international behavior as well as their internal behavior. I mean, sometimes, internal behavior \u2013 you can\u2019t really separate them because when you start oppressing your own people, you generate refugee flows, you generate humanitarian crises like you\u2019re seeing in Venezuela, for example. So \u2013 but there\u2019s not \u2013 saying something is a force of instability is saying or characterizing a set of facts. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a prescribed policy flow. None of this does.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis report doesn\u2019t say countries that reach a certain level we\u2019re going to cut off aid or something like that. It\u2019s the factual predicate for making those decisions, but those are policy decisions where the President and his advisors will have to weigh a whole number of factors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> And our final question --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask \u2013 can I ask a question on the Gaza and the West Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> -- Kylie from CBS News.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because, I mean, he pointed to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just go back to the reproductive rights for a second? So you said there are no obstacles for women to get contraception in any country except for if there\u2019s a remote issue, right?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> I said with some exceptions, and the exceptions were and still are \u2013 and we\u2019ve really gotten at it by flipping back to the original U.S. statutory language. It\u2019s in places like China, where in order to enforce their two \u2013 now two-child policy, that there are reports of coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization. In North Korea, where the government also coerces or forces abortion \u2013 although sometimes that\u2019s for political punishment rather than family planning. And we uncovered it \u2013 so as we were digging through trying to reduce the bulk of some of this report, I found in the old country I served in, in Belarus, that it turns out that the doctors in the state hospitals, and particularly in the institutions there, if they have a woman who is pregnant and who is a woman with disabilities, the doctors insist on an abortion. Or if they believe the fetus has a disability, they\u2019ll insist on an abortion. So we\u2019ve called that out too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not \u2013 those were the cases, though, in the \u2013 under the previous formula where you would say there was a restriction on family planning, freedom of family planning. For most countries, it said, there isn\u2019t any restriction except for the ones imposed by economics and rural-urban type thing. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> So just to be clear just on that, so taking out the language about those cases therefore means that the U.S. doesn\u2019t believe that the inability for women to get an abortion physically or by law is an abuse of human rights?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</strong> That \u2013 correct under the previous administration and this one and the one before that. We have never taken the position that abortion was a right under \u2013 a human right under international law. This is supposed to be internationally recognized human rights, and it\u2019s an issue on which \u2013 some countries prohibit abortion, some countries, like our own, pretty much no restriction on it, and we don\u2019t say one of those is right and one of those is wrong. We don\u2019t report on it because it\u2019s not a human right. It\u2019s an issue of great policy debate, you can have a good discussion, but there\u2019s no internationally recognized standard as to what\u2019s the right treatment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut the other, yes. The \u2013 it is internationally recognized that somebody shouldn\u2019t coerce you to have an abortion or force you to be sterilized, so that\u2019s --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>Thank you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask a question on the Palestinian --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We \u2013 the ambassador has to go. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, one quick question on the Palestinian (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT: </strong>We have to go. Sir, thank you. Thank you. We\u2019ll get you another time.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, welcome to our call today with Ambassador Mike Kozak of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Ambassador Kozak will talk about the 2016 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, which Secretary Tillerson released about an hour ago here at the State Department. This call is on-the-record, although it\u2019s embargoed until the end of the call.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ambassador Kozak. Thank you, sir.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK: </b>Thank you, Heather. I thought I might just briefly introduce what the report is, how it\u2019s prepared, the purposes it serves, and then be ready to take your question. As Secretary Tillerson mentioned in his remarks, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 requires the Secretary of State to prepare and transmit to Congress an annual report on international religious freedom describing the status of religious freedom in foreign countries and U.S. actions and policies in support of religious freedom worldwide.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDepartment of State officers in our embassies and consulates around the world, working with the State Department\u2019s Office of International Religious Freedom, obtain input from governments, media, NGOs, and others to come up with the content that goes into the report. The purpose of the report is to give Congress and the Executive Branch data to inform judgments about foreign assistance, allocation of diplomatic resources, and other issues, including adjudication of asylum and refugee requests. It is not designed to pass judgment or to rank other countries, but rather to create a fact-based review for use in U.S. Government decision making.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe instructions for preparing the report are the same for all countries. We do not single out countries or religious groups for special treatment. The record should be based on a country\u2019s actions, not on anybody\u2019s preconceived notions. The report does not automatically affect policy, but it does provide the factual input to policy decisions that get made during the year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI would also note that as \u2013 that this is the first religious freedom report to be issued under this administration \u2013 as the Secretary pointed out in his remarks, the administration is making a strong commitment to advancing religious freedom for all. The President, the Vice President, and the Secretary have all emphasized religious freedom as a priority of the administration. As the Secretary mentioned, Governor Brownback is the highest-ranking person to be nominated for the ambassador-at-large position since its creation in 1998. The U.S. has multiple ways to advance these rights across the world, and congressional actions add to them and last year strengthened those mechanisms. We will continue to lead the international community and partner with allies on ways to advance this issue.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust a few highlights, and a bit in the good news program. First, that ISIS is being defeated. And since the defeat of ISIS in great chunks of Iraq, it means that religious minorities can return to their liberated towns and villages, and the next challenge is to see that they have security and that their homes are rebuilt. There is also good news in terms of positive U.S. engagement. For example, due to steady engagement, and despite the severe religious freedom problems that the Secretary mentioned, Sudan this year released some people who were imprisoned for their religious beliefs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVietnam also, as a consequence of heavy U.S. engagement, improved its religion law. At the same time, in both countries the situations remain of great concern, and so we will stay engaged. But this is the kind of activity that we\u2019re looking for, incremental progress in improving religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve also had some positive overtures from the Uzbek Government, such as the president there\u2019s offer to amnesty to some religious prisoners. And if implemented, this would address a key religious freedom concern in Uzbekistan. We\u2019ve also, as the Secretary mentioned, asked the Sudanese Government to engage on religious freedom concerns and to work on an action plan for improving religious freedom in that country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOne note is that there is a growing consensus on the need to act. The genocidal acts of ISIS awakened the international community to the threats facing religious minorities. And in response, the U.S., with our Canadian partners, created a network of more than 20 countries focused on advancing religious freedom. It\u2019s called the International Contract<a name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Group for Freedom of Religion or Belief.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere is also increasing religious tolerance in some parts of the world. In Marrakech, Islamic scholars got together and issued a declaration promoting equal citizenship for religious minorities. In Tunisia, there was a remarkable display of government support for the annual pilgrimage to the Djerba island synagogue. And in the Persian Gulf, the United Arab Emirates and Oman allowed the construction of churches to host large expatriate communities, as well as Hindu temples and Sikh gurdwaras.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I will be happy to take your questions about the report. Please do stick to the report itself, which covers calendar year 2016. If you have questions about other issues or other periods of time, our regular spokespeople will be able to take those questions on another occasion. But with that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions and comments concerning the report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> All right. Thank you, Ambassador. First question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> All right. Ladies and gentlemen, again, if you do wish to ask a question, please press * followed by the 1. You\u2019ll hear a tone indicating that you\u2019ve been placed in queue, and you may remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the pound key. Once again, for questions please press *1 at this time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOur first question comes from Matthew Lee with the Associated Press. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi there. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m just \u2013 I imagine other people are going to have similar questions, so I\u2019ll make this one really brief. I\u2019m wondering how the report can \u2013 and the Secretary can \u2013 square the line, the protection of these groups, referring to the ISIS victims, and others who are targets of violent extremists remains a human rights priority for the Trump administration \u2013 how do you square that with the refugee decision? The appendix on refugee admissions to this report mentions that refugee admissions are a vital tool in helping to deal with religious persecution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, thanks for the question. Look, obviously, one of the purposes of the report is to provide that factual database so that our department and the Department of Homeland Security can use that in evaluating refugee claims from around the world. Every year, unfortunately, there are way, way, way more refugees than any one country can possibly take in. The number for the United States gets set each year through consultations between the President and the Congress. There have always been different protocols for vetting refugees for security and other reasons, and those vary from country to country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo just in talking with my colleague in the refugee department the other day, we are moving along, processing refugees. And I think a number of them \u2013 I don\u2019t have an exact number how many are people who are fleeing religious persecution as opposed to other types of persecution, but a significant percentage will be.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think also you should look at what we are doing in some of these areas. As I mentioned, your \u2013 in the areas liberated from ISIS, the preferred option is to allow people to return to their traditional villages and areas. We don\u2019t want to uproot communities that have been there for thousands of years and take them elsewhere if we can help provide them with the security and other means that they need to be able to resume their traditional role as valued members of their own societies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> Question comes from the line of Michele Kelemen with NPR. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yeah, just to follow up on Matt\u2019s question: Do Christians or other minorities sort of go to the front of the line in the refugee program now that you\u2019ve said that this is a \u2013 that protection of these groups is a human rights priority?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Look, you\u2019d have to ask our refugee people exactly how they\u2019re prioritizing different groups. It depends on the country. In some places, religious persecution is the primary form of persecution; in others, it\u2019s ethnic; sometimes it\u2019s a mixed state of the two. And I know PRM, our refugee bureau, does set up priorities for different countries or typologies that they look at, but I\u2019m not the expert on that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Nick Wadhams with Bloomberg. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. I have a similar sort of squaring-the-circle question, which is: How do you sort of square the demand for religious freedom overseas in the report against President Trump\u2019s own comments when he was a candidate seeking a Muslim ban, and then registry for Muslims, and then also circuit court decisions on the travel ban, finding that reasonable observers would conclude that the executive order was \u2013 its primary purpose was to exclude people on the basis of their religious beliefs? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Thank you. Well, first, I would put our record on religious freedom up against pretty much anybody in the world. The U.S. has a long, strong tradition of this. On the executive order, I \u2013 not sure I would share the characterizations that you\u2019ve made, but I\u2019m not the expert on the order. I think you\u2019ve had plenty of good explanation of what\u2019s behind it, how it operates and so on, both from our spokespeople, but also from Homeland Security, the Justice Department, and the White House. So I would just refer you back to them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> Our next question comes from the line of Gardiner Harris with <i>The New York Times</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. I noticed that \u2013 do you not track religious freedom in the United States? And if so, how would you square, for instance, this spike in attacks on Muslims in the United States that the FBI has cited and many others have cited over the past year? Isn\u2019t that precisely this sort of thing that your report would, and should, take note of?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, thank you. As is the case with the Human Rights Report, we do not rate ourselves. I \u2013 there was an effort to do so \u2013 I\u2019m old enough to remember; it was 30-some years ago. And when we all looked at it, people started laughing. It was like writing your own performance evaluation or something. You either were way too modest or you looked like you were bragging on yourself. So that \u2013 but that does not mean that the U.S. thinks itself exempt from this kind of rating. There are mechanisms in the United Nations, in the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe and so on that do publish this kind of data. There\u2019s an excellent, for example, in the OSCE, a tolerance unit. We \u2013 the U.S. is actually a pretty good model in that the data that you\u2019re citing there comes from FBI reports, and those are all cranked into the OSCE reports at the end of the year. So we actually have, I think, a better record than many of the other member-states in terms of reporting details about performance in our own country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we\u2019re very much desirous and responsive to being judged on our record, but are not \u2013 figure we should not be the judge and jury when it\u2019s \u2013 when it comes to ourselves but let others take on that role.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Wilt, representing <i>WORLD</i> <i>Magazine</i>. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thanks for taking my question. My \u2013 first part of my question is that from what I understand is that this report is supposed to come out May 1st each year, so my question for you is why was this delayed until August 15th?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd the second part is that from what I understand, you, sir, recommended that Russia should be designated the country of particular concern, and I don\u2019t think this report had Russia as a country of particular concern, so I was wondering why they were omitted. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Okay, thank you. On the date of the report, I think we\u2019re \u2013 this \u2013 pretty much the same place we were last year. It came out in mid-August last year as well. This is \u2013 when you\u2019re trying to get high-level people involved in the rollout and so on, trying to get all the stars to align sometimes takes a little bit of time, and in any event, we\u2019re very pleased that the Secretary did take the time and was able to do it personally this morning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn countries of particular concern, let me be clear that this report does not designate any countries as countries of particular concern. A separate part of the International Religious Freedom Act requires the Secretary and the President to make those designations 30 days after the issuance \u2013 or not 30 days, 90 days after the issuance of the report, so the ones you see designated were the ones that were designated last year. So the connection between the two is simply that this report does provide the fact base that will inform those judgments by the Secretary when the time comes to issue the CPC report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe role of the USCIRF, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, in this is that it is a \u2013 again, another separate entity established by the IRF Act, and it\u2019s designed to be an advisory body to the Executive Branch. So you\u2019ve got some really sharp, high-powered people on the IRF \u2013 USCIRF commission. In previous incarnations, I\u2019ve worked very closely with them. They come up with lots of good advice, but their advice isn\u2019t binding on the Executive. The Secretary will make his own decisions taking into account their recommendations, his own staff recommendations, and first and foremost the information that \u2013 the facts that are contained in the report.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Lisa Schwartz with <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing this. The judge \u2013 or the assessment of genocide that the Secretary mentioned, citing the report, does that imply any sort of legal ramifications or actions separate from a similar determination that the Obama administration made?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, thank you. I\u2019ll jump back to one of my old jobs to try to give you the best answer I can, although I\u2019m not currently with the Legal Adviser\u2019s Office. The obligation with respect to genocide is that countries that have signed on to the convention are supposed to criminalize it, which the U.S. has; and then second, if you find someone who has committed genocide within your territory or jurisdiction, you either have to prosecute them or extradite them to another country that can prosecute them. So that\u2019s the essential legal obligation with respect to genocide, and it hasn\u2019t changed whether it\u2019s this administration or the previous administration. And it \u2013 now, there\u2019s the moral side of it too, which is what are you going to do to try to put a stop to genocide, and I think on that we, the U.S., have a good record in that we\u2019re in the process of defeating the perpetrators of the genocide pretty soundly in Iraq and elsewhere. So those are the \u2013 there\u2019s first the legal obligation, which is extradite or prosecute, and then the moral obligation is to try to stop it, and I think the administration has very good news on that front in terms of pushing ISIS back into the hole it crawled out of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, thank you. Next question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> All right, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Clark with the AFP. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, good afternoon \u2013 good morning, thanks for taking the call. Secretary Tillerson has been very clear when he\u2019s been outlining his policy review that the goal of America First is to prioritize prosperity and the security of the American people. Can you explain why it\u2019s so important to protect religious freedom in foreign countries and how this aids in the prosperity and the security of Americans at home? Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes, thank you. Good morning. I think it\u2019s true of religious freedom, particularly also of human rights abuse generally that when we see serious abuses of people\u2019s basic rights, that correlates very often and very closely with instability and unrest and warfare and murder around the world. And so if you can take care of these problems or make improvements, give people hope that they can practice their own faiths without interruption, you reduce the chances of civil wars breaking out and terrorist recruitment and that kind of thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s \u2013 yes, we have a very strong national interest in not having those things happen and get ourselves caught up in it, and if we can, through diplomacy and through programming and other work that we do, try to minimize the \u2013 or reduce the fertile field for those kinds of things growing up, we\u2019ve done something that does help protect the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you. Next question, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>OPERATOR:</b> Next question today comes from the line of Yeganeh Torbati with Reuters. Please, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, thanks for doing this. In the section on Saudi Arabia, it notes that Saudi Arabia often uses counterterrorism laws to target both atheists and Shia Muslims, and I\u2019m just wondering, given the cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia when it comes to counterterrorism, particularly the new initiatives that were announced when President Trump visited in May, is there any effort or are there any restrictions that the United States places on its support when it comes to Saudi Arabia to make sure that it\u2019s not used to target religious minorities?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>AMBASSADOR KOZAK:</b> Yes. Well, I think in Saudi, that it \u2013 we had the problem of the excessive or overbroad use of antiterrorism laws. That\u2019s true of quite a number of countries. And then also, the Saudi Government simply does not recognize the right of non-Muslims to practice their religion in public and imposes criminal penalties for doing so. So that is why Saudi has been listed in the past as a country of particular concern, which does cut off assistance unless there is a waiver, and there have routinely been waivers for that country because of the things that we do in common.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, that said, we \u2013 with respect to our security assistance everywhere in the world, there are efforts made to be sure that none of it goes to units that would engage in repression of people. We have \u2013 one of the things our bureau does, for example, is anytime we\u2019re training or equipping foreign security forces, whether it\u2019s police or military, we have to vet the units that are being trained or equipped to see if they have any record of committing gross violations of human rights. And if they have, they don\u2019t get that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo yes, the problems exist in Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ve been working to try to get the government to improve its record and have made some progress on some parts of it \u2013 not enough to get them off the CPC list as \u2013 at least as of last year. And at the same time, we applied it to them but also to all other countries. We do our darndest to try to be sure that we\u2019re not putting U.S. training and weaponry to use in service of human rights or religious freedom violations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Thank you, everyone. That\u2019s all we have time for right now. Thanks for joining us and thank you to Ambassador Kozak for answering the questions. The embargo on this call has now been lifted. Hope you have a great day and we look forward to seeing you later.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">\n\t<hr align=\"center\" size=\"3\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_ftn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Contact\n</p>\n\n</div>"

This action reflects the U.S. commitment to doing all it can to protect the innocent people of South Sudan.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy placing these entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List, the United States will impose a license requirement on all exports, re-exports, and transfers of any U.S.-origin items to those entities. The names of these specific entities will be published in the Federal Register on March 22. Technical questions regarding the details of today\u2019s action should be addressed to the Department of Commerce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe listed entities are a source of substantial revenue for the Government of South Sudan. Unfortunately, the South Sudanese Government, and corrupt official actors, use this revenue to purchase weapons and fund irregular militias that undermine the peace, security, and stability of South Sudan rather than support the welfare and current emergency food needs of the South Sudanese people. We call on the region and broader international community to join us in limiting the financial flows that fuel the continuing violence in the country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Government of South Sudan can do better. The United States expects it, as well as the armed opposition, to fulfill their commitments to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and to their own people to cease hostilities, allow unimpeded humanitarian access, and pursue a negotiated peace in good faith. As the largest donor of aid to South Sudan, the United States is proud to uphold humanitarian values and deliver vital assistance. The Government of South Sudan must not squander that generosity and should take concrete steps to provide for the vast needs of the South Sudanese people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday\u2019s actions are part of our ongoing effort to hold to account those who foment violence, commit human rights violations, obstruct the peace process, or engage in illicit financial activities against the interest of the South Sudanese people.

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country.

I\u2019m a little shorter than the Secretary, so pardon me here for my \u2013 for my little box. I have a couple announcements to make, and then I\u2019d be happy to take your questions, although it\u2019s certainly a hard act to follow when you have the Secretary of State.\n\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"DEPARTMENT\"></a>Today I\u2019d like to mention that our Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan is in Brazil. He\u2019s meeting with his counterpart, the Deputy Foreign Minister Galvao, to launch the U.S.-Brazil Permanent Forum on Security. The forum is a result of cooperation between the United States and Brazil, and the Permanent Forum on Security. They are working there to fight transnational crime. They aim to foster continued teamwork, combat drug trafficking, arms trafficking, cyber-crime, money laundering, and also terrorism. Yesterday in Buenos Aires, the deputy secretary joined representatives from Argentina, Canada, Australia, Mexico, and Chile to condemn the fraudulent electoral process that culminated in sham elections in Venezuela on May the 20th. He echoed Secretary Pompeo\u2019s vow that the United States will take swift economic and diplomatic actions and welcomed a strong statement from the Lima Group unequivocally calling out the illegitimate electoral process and responding to the national \u2013 the regional humanitarian crisis caused by the Maduro regime\u2019s rampant corruption and also mismanagement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also want to note recent sanctions announcements that were made both on Friday and on Monday of this week. These sanctions reflect the continued commitment of the United States to use every appropriate diplomatic and economic tool to hold the corrupt Maduro regime accountable. The United States stands with the Venezuelan people in their efforts to restore democracy to their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn addition to that, I\u2019d like to note our pleasure in announcing the announcement by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, an additional $7 million, bringing the total U.S. assistance thus far to $8 million in the fight against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As you know, there is an Ebola virus outbreak there right now. The $7 million in additional funding includes 5 million specifically authorized by Secretary Pompeo to address this crisis. One million of that money came from USAID. The funds will provide immediate resources to help combat the spread of this deadly disease. The U.S. Government is committed to global health security and commends the proactive efforts of the Congolese, and also our other international partners to control this outbreak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd lastly, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression in Ukraine. This has been one of the most violent weeks of the year. Five Ukrainian soldiers are now dead and 23 have been wounded. The fighting has not spared civilians either. A 13-year-old boy and his father were killed in a Ukrainian Government controlled territory when artillery shells struck their home. A pipe carrying chlorine gas at the Donetsk water filtration station was struck by artillery shells.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Kremlin controls the violence in eastern Ukraine and could bring this violence to an end tomorrow if the Kremlin wanted to do that. Russia has claimed it wants to protect Russian speakers, but as our Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, Kurt Volker has pointed out on numerous occasions, there\u2019s nowhere in the world more dangerous for Russian speakers right now than in eastern Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and civilians continue to die in a conflict manufactured by the Russian Government with forces that arms, equips, leads, and trains. And while Russia perpetuates the violence in eastern Ukraine by pouring money, soldiers, and resources into the region, the Russian economy continues to stagnate. We call on Russia to end its aggression in Ukraine and live up to its commitments when it signed the Minsk agreements.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Do we start with you again?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>That seems a little unfair, but okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Well, I don\u2019t know.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Okay, go right ahead, Matt.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I don\u2019t think so. Just before I go onto something else, quickly on Venezuela.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"VENEZUELA\"></a><b>QUESTION: </b>I\u2019m sorry I was spacing out a little bit there when you were reading your statement. Did you talk about the PNGs of the charge and the number two?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I did not, though.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I didn\u2019t think so. It\u2019s so late that I\u2019m kind of --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>I know. Well, wasn\u2019t it worth it? Now you wonder why --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>I suppose.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>-- our briefing \u2013 why our briefing was late.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION: </b>Anyway, so what can you tell us about the expulsions of these \u2013 your diplomats from Venezuela?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Yeah, look, I can just say we\u2019ve seen the reports. This happened not that long ago. But we\u2019ve seen the reports that the Maduro regime intends to declare our charge d\u2019affaires Todd Robinson and our Deputy Chief of Mission Brian Naranjo persona non grata. I can say we completely reject the false allegations that have been made by the Maduro regime against our two colleagues. And I have nothing further beyond that, but we\u2019ll let you know if we do get anything in addition to that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thanks. Can I move to Mideast for a --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Certainly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"ISRAEL\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> The Palestinians today took the \u2013 took their brief or complaints against Israel to the International Criminal Court. And I am wondering: one, what you make of that move by the Palestinians; and secondly, if this is going to have any impact on the way the administration now approaches the Palestinians either legally or any other way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we have long believed that these types of actions are not conducive to peace. We are not a party to the International Criminal Court, as many of you know. We oppose the actions taking place against Israel at the International Criminal Court because we see that simply as counterproductive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have spoken about this many times before. Our position on this matter is well known. We oppose actions against Israel as \u2013 at the International Criminal \u2013 Criminal Court \u2013 pardon me \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t help the cause for peace. And that is one of the priorities of this administration, getting the Israelis and Palestinians back to the table where they can have a good, concrete negotiation about the peace process going forward. And the ICC just doesn\u2019t do that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Okay. But the ICC was created \u2013 and I realize that the U.S. is not a member of it, but it was created to provide accountability. So is there anything that you think that Israel needs to be accountable for to the Palestinians?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, I\u2019m not going to get into that question. I think we have long talked about the situation going on in Gaza. We\u2019ve long talked about the misery that the people face in Gaza is because of Hamas. We have seen and have watched as the previous clashes between the Israelis and Palestinians and those of Gaza have taken place. We\u2019ve continued to call on Hamas to take better care of its people; it\u2019s not taking care of its people. And I don\u2019t have really much beyond that to give you right now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Just on the Gaza thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I want to ask you about Ambassador Friedman\u2019s op-ed column. Is it the position of the administration, as it appears to be the position \u2013 the personal position of the ambassador, that the quote-unquote \u201cliberal media\u201d have blood on their hands for their coverage?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I can tell you I\u2019m aware of the ambassador\u2019s editorial. I don\u2019t have anything to say about that. I could just refer you to Ambassador Friedman for any questions about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, does it reflect the administration\u2019s view that there is --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have anything --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- there is quote-unquote a \u201cliberal media\u201d that has blood on its hands?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have anything for you on that. I\u2019d just have to refer you to the ambassador for anything (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> All right. Well, do you have anything on him posing for a photograph today that photoshopped out the al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount for a facsimile of what would be a third temple?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, I\u2019m not going to say much about this because this information just came to us as I was coming out to brief today. So until we have a full assessment of what actually happened, I\u2019m going to be limited in terms of what I can say about this particular incident.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe have received a statement, however, I can share with you from Ambassador Friedman. He says he was not aware of the image that was put in front of him when the photo was taken. He was deeply disappointed that anyone would take advantage of his visit to Bnei Brak to create controversy. The U.S. policy is absolutely clear: We support the status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. I don\u2019t have anything for you beyond that because, again, this was just \u2013 information was just coming out as I was coming out here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that a statement in his name, or is that something that was put out by the embassy?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I have Friedman\u2019s statement. I have Ambassador Friedman\u2019s statement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> That\u2019s a statement from him. So --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I believe so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So \u2013 but does he apologize for it? I mean, this is something that is deeply --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, that\u2019s all I have. Look, again --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> This is deeply offensive to more than 20 percent of the population. He\u2019s laughing in the photograph.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> He is saying that he was not aware of the image that was taken and that someone took advantage of him being at that location. I don\u2019t have anything beyond that. I\u2019d refer you over to our embassy to answer additional questions about that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But on the op-ed --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, Michelle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Surely \u2013 thanks. Surely you\u2019re able to say whether or not he\u2019s speaking for the State Department or not, at least.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, I don\u2019t have anything to say for you about this. I can just refer you to the ambassador at this point. Okay, all right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Well, we just need to know: Who do this guy represent? Does he represent himself when he writes an opinion piece that says \u2013 that refers to his title?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Look, all I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t have anything for you on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Does he represent \u2013 does he represent the administration? Does he represent the State Department? Does he represent the President? I mean, he does do all of those things with the title \u201cambassador\u201d on it. And if that\u2019s just his personal opinion, then okay, whatever. But if that\u2019s the position of the administration, then we need to know about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I would refer you to the ambassador\u2019s office. Anything else? Shall we move on?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Hi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A follow-up. One quick follow-up on the PLO. Will you take action to close the PLO office because they\u2019ve now gone to the ICC?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I know that was an issue that was brought up before under our previous secretary. As far as I am aware, that is all under consideration \u2013 the status of the PLO office, I mean. And I\u2019m not going to get ahead of any additional \u2013 potential steps or actions on the part of that office and any determination.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay. Hi, Laurie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. So yesterday, Secretary Pompeo said, and I quote here, \u201cIran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.\u201d That is an issue that you\u2019ll be working on now? That\u2019s the strongest statement any U.S. official has made about the problem. Is that an issue that you\u2019ll be working on now with the Iraqi Government?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Sovereignty is something that\u2019s in our National Security Strategy, the administration\u2019s National Security Strategy, and that is respecting the sovereignty of another government and respecting the sovereignty of Iraq. You heard what the Secretary had to say about that yesterday. We respect Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and we partner with the Iraqi Government. We have for very many years. We have a great relationship with the Government of Iraq. Their efforts to protect their sovereignty from malign forces both inside and outside its borders continue to stand and they are quite strong in that action.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And Muqtada al-Sadr, since he\u2019s so anti-Iranian, would be a good partner for this?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not saying that. We will work with whoever the Iraqi Government and the people of Iraq decide to elect into its government. We\u2019ve had a long, good \u2013 longstanding, good relationship with the Government of Iraq and we will continue to have a good relationship with them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And if I could ask you one more question?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Mm-hmm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> The Iraqi electoral commission released the election results without dealing with the multiple complaints of fraud. Do you think that issue needs to be more seriously investigated?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> My understanding is that is still under investigation, and that investigation or the look at the election process continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you support that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, we certainly continue to support the organization that\u2019s going through and taking a look at the election results, including complaints that you mentioned, and as far as I know, that that process continues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Can I follow up on that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah. Hi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Brett McGurk has been meeting with multiple parties in Iraqi Kurdistan and in Iraq. He met also with those parties that complained about the elections and the \u2013 can you share with us what is the meetings about? What is he talking to --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have the specifics about Brett\u2019s meetings. What Mr. McGurk typically does is he meets with a range of parties from the north, including in Baghdad as well. I don\u2019t have the specifics from those meetings, but I know that he\u2019s engaged in a lot of conversations with the government.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And also at the same time, Qasem Soleimani is also meeting with a range of political parties, and so what is \u2013 are you doing anything or what is the U.S. doing to contain the Iranian influence on the formation of the next government in Iraq?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> We have long said that we think that \u2013 not long said, but we have said since the election that we thought for \u2013 a coalition government would be formed. We\u2019re not going to get ahead of that process. We will work with the government, whoever the people elect, whoever the people decide. In terms of whether or not he\u2019s meeting with Muqtada al-Sadr, I just don\u2019t have any information for you on that. Okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLet\u2019s move on to something else.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"BURUNDI\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Burundi?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, there. Yes, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We saw a statement yesterday \u2013 thank you very much. Just wondering if you have more to add regarding the Burundi referendum, because the constitutional referendum could extend the president\u2019s rule through 2034.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Let me see if I do. I do somewhere have something on that. And of course, we had watched the news come out of Burundi as they were stifling conversation and debate within the media, including your organization, Voice of America.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe May 17th referendum process in Burundi was marred by lack of transparency, the suspension of media outlets, including Voice of America and also your colleague here from the BBC as well, and also attempts to pressure voters. The government allowed vigorous campaigning by the opposition during a designated two-week period, but prior to that, we had heard about numerous cases of harassment and also repression of the referendum opponents in the months that preceded the vote and contributed to a climate of fear and also of repression, and that\u2019s a serious concern of ours. The overall absence of independent observers also undermines confidence in the reported results.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want to be clear about our condemnation of the government\u2019s recent decision to suspend the Voice of America and also BBC broadcasts. The decision, along with other media restrictions, arbitrary arrests, harsh sentences for human rights defenders signals a continuing limitation on civil and political space in Burundi.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLastly, I\u2019d like to say we remain concerned about the passage of a revised constitution, that passage of the revised constitution will be interpreted as resetting the presidential term limits. We want to highlight that the ruling party made a commitment under the Pretoria Protocol with respect to the principles of the Arusha Agreement, including the respect for term limits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you. Okay. Let\u2019s move on. Hi, Michelle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"KOREANPENINSULA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> On <a name=\"NORTHKOREA\"></a>North Korea --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- the major hesitation that we saw from the President today on that subject, how much of that would you say could be due to an early overselling of the situation on the part of South Korea? Or do you think that we\u2019re way past that by now and that this is something else?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, I think the Secretary addressed a lot of these questions, so I am not going to step on what the Secretary just had to say about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Oh, come on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> -- about our meetings potentially on June the 12th. Look, I think the South Koreans proposed to us some meetings that the government \u2013 Kim Jong-un of North Korea \u2013 was willing to undertake with the United States. I think the United States met this in a full, good-faith effort to try to have those conversations, but beyond that, I\u2019m not just \u2013 I\u2019m not going to step on what the Secretary just had to say, or the President, for that matter. I think they did a sufficient job of addressing that and I couldn\u2019t \u2013 certainly couldn\u2019t do any better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHi. Go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. Going back to the bilateral for a moment, the President said that there are certain conditions that we want to happen in reference to the U.S.-North Korea summit. Can you offer any clarification on what those conditions are?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think we\u2019ve been very clear all along \u2013 and the Secretary alluded to this before \u2013 complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. How many times have you heard me say that here? A lot. That\u2019s our policy. Our policy has not changed and we stand there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So still on North Korea but not on the meeting per se. So the closure of the Punggye-ri site \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about this before, but because \u2013 especially since they didn\u2019t bring in expert, like, witnesses mostly; they just let in the press. So what is the U.S. position on that? Do you see that as a good sign for them moving to denuclearization?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, look, I\u2019m going to be very careful about what I say on this entire topic, and I hope you will all understand that. I can only say we saw as reporters went there and covered what the Government of North Korea had said was happening, the dismantling of a nuclear site. We certainly welcome the announcement of plans to dismantle its nuclear test site. I\u2019d go back to permanent, irreversible closure that can be inspected and fully accounted for. That is a key step in the denuclearization for North Korea, and we look forward to learning more about the details of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather, can I just follow up on the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, go ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- on the closure of the nuclear site. Did the U.S. request for any officials to be able to attend that closure?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I can only tell you that we have not had a \u2013 an invitation that was extended to us. My understanding is that the journalists were invited, and I just don\u2019t have anything beyond that, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll right.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Hi, sir. How are you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAN\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> Iran, please.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A couple days ago, the ambassador \u2013 Russian ambassador in Syria urged all foreign forces to leave the country, including Iran and Hizballah, and a spokesperson in Tehran at the foreign ministry said no one can make Iran do anything against its will. How do you read that and were you surprised?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It looks like there is a tension between the --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Well, look, I think it\u2019s particularly rich that Russia would say that other countries must leave Syria and that Russia wouldn\u2019t choose to do so itself. So I\u2019m pretty suspicious of countries that are there backing the government of Bashar al-Assad. We\u2019ve had a lot \u2013 far too many conversations about the brutality and the nature of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. They continue to this day to be backed by Russia and also Iran. They continue to gas and kill their own people. The United States will continue to work to hold them responsible and hold those other regimes responsible, as we believe the world will increasingly step in and try to do so as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But to mention Iran by name didn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t surprise you? Did it surprise you or --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> To mention Iran by name.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I\u2019m not going to comment on anything beyond what the Russians may say about the United States or other countries. What they have to say about Iran \u2013 they can say whatever they like, okay?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Hi. Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> From the Secretary\u2019s remarks yesterday and today, there\u2019s \u2013 particularly yesterday, obviously, there was some speculation that essentially what he wants is \u2013 the U.S. wants is regime change in Iran. Do you --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> That is not our policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But does the United States believe that it can work with this \u2013 the Government of Iran to achieve its objectives --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think the Secretary was very clear in his speech yesterday about our government\u2019s concerns \u2013 and other governments share these very rational concerns \u2013 about the activities of the Iranian regime. For far too long, administrations have simply looked at Iran through the lens of the JPCOA, through the nuclear agreement. This administration is choosing to focus on not only keeping Americans safe, keeping our allies and partners safe, and frankly, keeping the world safe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> But his answer today wasn\u2019t, \u201cWe think these sanctions will work even if it takes a long time,\u201d it was once again calling on the Iranian people themselves to do something about that. So if he\u2019s not advocating regime change, why does he keep making it sound exactly like he\u2019s advocating regime change?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think what he\u2019s saying is this is up to the Iranian people. The Iranian people for far too long have lived under a regime that has mistreated its people. We\u2019ve seen the human rights abuses, we\u2019ve seen the clampdown on the media, we\u2019ve seen the clampdown on freedom of expression. That continues to happen each and every day. People are imprisoned; we don\u2019t always know where they are, including Americans who are being held there as well. So I think the Secretary was very clear about concerns that the Iranian people have themselves \u2013 the Persian people, a very proud people. And we\u2019ve seen a certain level of frustration and anger at their own government for promises that the government has not fulfilled. That government, back when the JCPOA was put into effect said, effectively, \u201cWe will share this money with you. You will see the fruits of this.\u201d The people have not seen that. Those promises were not fulfilled, and so we see an increasing level of frustration by their own people. Our policy --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So what does he want them to do?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Our policy is not regime change; but if the Iranian people were to choose somewhere down the road to make their views known, they\u2019re certainly welcome to do so. But that is not our policy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Just to follow up on that --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"IRAQ2\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> I mean, on your previous comment about Iraq, you\u2019ve said essentially that the U.S. is willing to work with whichever government the people of Iraq elect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think it\u2019s up to the Government of Iran how they want to behave. We certainly haven\u2019t seen them behave as a responsible international partner for very many years. There\u2019s no one who knows that better than my colleagues here at the State Department when we look back at what happened to our colleagues and our embassy so many years ago. We\u2019ve seen that as Iran has had such a destabilizing influence in the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary was recently in Saudi Arabia, where we had conversations with our Saudi Arabian partners about the missiles that had been launched on Riyadh. I\u2019d go back to you and say this: Imagine that happening at any other country around the world, where the Iranian regime is launching missiles at an airport, a commercial airport. You could hit civilians, you could hit Americans, could cause a great deal of damage. The world should not tolerate that from Iran. The would certainly wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from other countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> A couple things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> And we\u2019re going to have to wrap. We\u2019re going to have to wrap in just a minute.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It\u2019s not actually Iran that\u2019s \u2013 are you saying that Iran is firing these missiles?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Iran is backing the Houthi rebels, and we\u2019ve been very clear about that. This is not the first time we\u2019ve had that conversation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Inaudible.) Also, when you say for far too long the Iranian people have lived under this \u2013 these abuses that you talked about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> -- you\u2019re referring back to \u201979, to the Iranian Revolution?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> This has happened for a very long time. This is nothing new, Matt. I don\u2019t think you should be surprised by this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> No, I just want to know: Are you drawing a distinction between the human rights paradise that Iran was under the shah?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Matt, I am simply saying that people there have experienced repression. They know that repression very well. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"SAUDIARABIA\"></a><b>QUESTION:</b> And then last one on Saudi, because you just mentioned it --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I just want to \u2013 you can go back to Iran. I just need to get a \u2013 I just need to get your reaction to the arrests of these women\u2019s rights activists. There seem to be more today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Are there reports of \u2013 of that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> It might have been yesterday. I think it\u2019s up to 10 now, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I don\u2019t have the number. I can just tell you Saudi Arabia, as I just mentioned, was a country we recently visited. We remain supportive of their overall reform agenda. I think that\u2019s an important step in the right direction. A lot of people here and around the world were pleased and very happy to have heard their decision about women being able to drive on their own, attending movie theaters, and things of this sort. I can tell you that we are watching this carefully. We are concerned about the announced detention of activists in Saudi Arabia. We support space for civil society and also free speech, but overall, we\u2019re concerned about it and we are keeping a close eye on it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay, last question.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> On Iran, the Secretary of State yesterday and today talked about assassinations in the heart of Europe being carried out today by the Quds Force. Are there any details about that? We looked and couldn\u2019t find anything.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Yeah, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ask the Secretary about that himself.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I was rather late. I apologize.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> He has information and access to information that I do not. I\u2019m not able to comment on that in particular, but I can tell you that the Secretary has assured me that there is a basis for that point in his speech and he stands firmly behind that. Okay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it\u2019s sort of classified intelligence information he\u2019s saying there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I won\u2019t comment beyond that, but I can tell you that the Secretary has assured us of that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOkay, guys, we have to wrap it there. Thank you so much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t(The briefing was concluded at 4:23 p.m.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDPB # 29\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s on-the-record conference call with our director of policy planning, Brian Hook. It\u2019s certainly been a busy week with calls and outreach to our allies and partners in which we\u2019ve been discussing our next steps on Iran. Following this, Secretary Pompeo will deliver a speech on Monday to outline the administration\u2019s overall strategy to counter Iran\u2019s malign influence. Director Hook is here to speak with us today in advance of that speech.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs a reminder, this briefing is on the record. It will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call. Brian has just about 10 minutes to take your questions, so I would encourage you to be brief. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Director Hook for some brief opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brian, go right ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks, Heather. Good to be with all of you. Just make a few points here. The Secretary \u2013 Secretary Pompeo will be giving a speech on Monday. It will be his first major foreign policy address as Secretary of State. It will be a very timely address because it is presenting the way forward post the Iran nuclear deal withdrawal. And he\u2019ll be essentially presenting a diplomatic roadmap to achieve a new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal, following the President\u2019s decision to end America\u2019s participation in the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary has had very good phone calls with the ministers, the foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. We have been working closely with the Europeans over the last week at various levels of government \u2013 the President, the Secretary of State. I\u2019ve been in touch with the political directors of the E3. We\u2019ve had staff discussion. So we have been in very extensive and deep consultations with the Europeans on the way forward. Our broad approach now that we\u2019ve been emphasizing is that we need a new \u2013 a framework that\u2019s going to address the totality of Iran\u2019s threats. And this involves a range of things around its nuclear program \u2013 missiles, proliferating missiles and missile technology, its support for terrorists, and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we see an opportunity to counter and address Iran\u2019s nuclear and proliferation threats, its destabilizing activity, and to create a better nonproliferation and deterrence architecture for Iran and the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\u2019s broadly the way forward. I\u2019m happy to take some questions. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday; that\u2019s only three days away from now. And he looks forward to presenting a comprehensive strategy toward Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Brian, thank you. We\u2019ll start with our first question. That\u2019s with Josh Lederman from the Associated Press. Hi, Josh.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hey, thanks for doing this, Brian. I just wanted to ask you about the prospects of getting other countries, and particularly the Europeans, to join any kind of coalition. I mean, the Europeans are moving ahead with using the blocking statute; they\u2019re even considering direct transfers to Iran\u2019s central bank. So what makes you think they\u2019re going to join you? And if you don\u2019t get the Europeans or actually any of the P5+1 on board, can this coalition still have enough weight to succeed in bringing Iran back to the table? Thanks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that we agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on. During the negotiations with the E3, we made a lot of progress not only \u2013 I mean, just on the nuclear piece, on the \u2013 on sunsets, on ICBMs, on a stronger inspections regime, but also on the regional activities, human rights, the range of missiles that are destabilizing the region.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we, I think, have the very \u2013 I think we assess the situation very similarly in terms of the wanting to take a comprehensive approach. When President Macron was in the United States he talked about the four pillars, and his \u2013 what he was talking about is a very comprehensive approach. And I think for the last many years, the last three years or so, the JCPOA gave a lot of people a sort of false sense of security that by addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, that we were somehow then addressing the totality of Iranian threats. And it\u2019s important that we \u2013 that we change that dynamic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think that, again, we agree on more than we disagree, and we, as I said, have been working with the Europeans over the last week or two, and just in consultations with them, and we want to continue the momentum from our work with our European allies. And we see this, the coming months, as an opportunity to expand our efforts and to work with a lot of countries who share the same concerns about nonproliferation, about terrorism, about stoking civil wars around the region, and so we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re very hopeful about the \u2013 about the diplomacy ahead.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT: </b>Thank you, Brian. Next question, Michael Gordon from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Hi, Michael.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Hook, the diplomats in Europe that I\u2019ve spoken with have said that it\u2019s clear the administration wants tough sanctions, but the administration has yet to spell out in any detail what it \u2013 the arrangements that it thinks should be put in place now that the JCPOA has been scrapped. What specific nuclear constraints do you think are necessary post-JCPOA in the sphere of enrichment or other nuclear activities? And if you can\u2019t say what you want in terms of nuclear constraints, how can you ask the Europeans to impose tough sanctions? You\u2019re asking them to impose tough sanctions but you\u2019ve not defined your goal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> I think, Michael, that\u2019s part of the reason why the Secretary is giving a speech on Monday. But Brian, I\u2019ll let you take it from here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, that is \u2013 this is \u2013 as I said, this will be the Secretary\u2019s first major foreign policy address. He has decided to make that on Iran. And we will be discussing our vision to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which has had a definite military dimension to it, and the Iranians have yet to come clean on the military dimensions of their nuclear activities. That is going to be part \u2013 I mean, obviously with what Israel disclosed recently, that Iran has been protecting and preserving a vast atomic archive while it has been implementing the JCPOA, and of course that increases the relevance of the sunsets. We don\u2019t believe that Iran has earned the trust of the world to have restrictions on its nuclear program lifted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Carol \u2013 sorry, Brian.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah, go ahead, Heather.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay. Carol Morello from <i>The Washington Post</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Thanks for doing this. Say, Donald Tusk said some pretty strong things a couple of days ago about the administration. Basically, I think he said: With friends like this, who needs enemies? But at least we now know if you need a helping hand, you don\u2019t have to go farther than the end of your arm.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo I was wondering what, if anything, that Secretary Pompeo will be doing to address the lingering resentment over Iran. I realize that\u2019s not the only issue, but that\u2019s certainly one. And also, if you could address a little bit of what kind of negotiation do you see with Iran. You seem to be seeking a surrender on their part, not a negotiation. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Yeah. The President expressed his appreciation to our European partners. And we have worked, tried to fix the significant flaws in the nuclear deal to counter Iranian aggression. He believes very strongly in supporting the Iranian people. We believe that our shared values and commitment to confront sort of the common security challenges will transcend any disagreements over the JCPOA. And we weren\u2019t able to bridge all the gaps between our respective views on the JCPOA. We think that we\u2019ve been able to make a lot of progress on the range of issues on the nuclear and security sort of objectives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture, a new framework, and I think that, again, people, I think, are overstating the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Brian, thanks. Lesley Wroughton from Reuters is next.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Yes, hi, Brian. I kind of want to come back to what the others are trying to say, because at a time when \u2013 a sensitive time when you\u2019re actually trying to get Iran to be part of discussions, it seems that you\u2019re pushing them away. How does one convince them through this new architecture that it\u2019s to their benefit?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Well, you\u2019ve seen the protests in Iran, and you\u2019ve seen their dissatisfaction with \u2013 I think the Iranian people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime which have not helped the Iranian people. The President has spoken very eloquently about the concerns of the Iranian people. And so we \u2013 the President has said \u2013 I can\u2019t remember if it was the President said it or \u2013 but we have said that we are ready to negotiate a better deal, and there are a range of nations that can be a part of that. We certainly have the folks within the JCPOA, but we think there are other countries that also share these concerns, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, last question is Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. Hey, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Hi. Brian, do you have a timeframe for how long the U.S. would like this next round of negotiations to occur? At what point would the U.S. just say this is not going to happen? And can you also draw a parallel to North Korea? One of the things the administration has said about why North Korea came to the table was this maximum pressure campaign that left it so isolated diplomatically and economically. Do you believe that you could obtain the same scenario with Iran, that you would be able to create a similarly sort of airtight sanctions regime again with them?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK: </b>With the \u2013 by reimposing the sanctions that were lifted under the JCPOA, that will bring economic pressure to bear on Iran. It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago. We very much want a diplomatic outcome, one that is going to increase the security of the American people. We thought that the JCPOA provided too much in return for too little, and we also thought that it had very strong deficiencies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are going to be very focused on trying to achieve the President\u2019s national security objectives, and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions is part of our diplomatic strategy to try to achieve a better security architecture. And so the goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be discussing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe very much want to be \u2013 have a very kind of up-tempo diplomacy, one that\u2019s very focused and very determined to achieve our national security objectives. And Secretary Pompeo is committed to spending as much time as necessary with his team to achieve our goals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MS NAUERT:</b> Okay, everyone, we have to wrap it up. Brian, thank you so much for your time. Everyone, thanks for calling in. We look forward to having as many of you join us for the Secretary\u2019s speech on Monday. I believe we\u2019ll be sending out a formal announcement if we haven\u2019t already. So we look forward to talking with you. The embargo has now been lifted. And have a great weekend, everyone. Brian, thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>MR HOOK:</b> Thanks.\n</p>\n\n</div>"

(Applause.) Welcome to the Heritage Foundation. My name is Kay James and I have the honor of being the president here. It is a pleasure and honor to welcome our distinguished guest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, back to Heritage. Yes, I said back. Some of you may remember that then-Congressman Pompeo spoke here on September 9th, 2015. His presence was appreciated, as his topic was timely. It was entitled \u201cA Pathway Forward: An Alternative to the Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal.\u201d And now we have the great pleasure of being with our friend in his new role as Secretary of State for the United States of America. It\u2019s not just a pleasure having him here; it\u2019s truly an honor that he chose Heritage as the site for his first public address as Secretary.\n\n\n<p>\n\tOur scholars here are dedicated to advancing individual freedom and national security, and his presence here is a wonderful affirmation of the positive impact that their work is having. And so to Secretary Pompeo, I\u2019d like to say thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow, I imagine all who are in this room and watching online know a great deal about Secretary Pompeo, but please allow me to provide just a few highlights from his extraordinary career. Secretary Pompeo graduated first in his class at the United States military academy at West Point, and then served as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He also served with the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the U.S. Army\u2019s 4th Infantry Division. After leaving active duty, he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then had a successful private sector career, founding and serving as CEO of Thayer Aerospace and then becoming president of Sentry International.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo\u2019s public service began when he was elected representative of Kansas\u2019s 4th Congressional District, and his distinguished tenure on the Hill included service on the House Intelligence Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Select Benghazi Committee. Recognizing the Secretary\u2019s many talents, President Trump tapped him as director of the CIA, where he served from January 2017 to April 2018. And now, of course, he is our Secretary of State, having been sworn in just three and a half weeks ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLast but, of course, never least, Secretary Pompeo is married to Susan Pompeo and has one son, Nick.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecretary Pompeo, on behalf of the board of trustees, the staff, and all of the friends of the Heritage Foundation, welcome back to home. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the Heritage Foundation and its president, Kay Coles James. Thank you for hosting me today. First as a private citizen and then as a member of Congress, and even today, the Heritage Foundation has shaped my thinking on matters of the world and public policy issues. I\u2019m grateful for that excellent work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thanks for reminding me I can\u2019t talk about anything else but what we\u2019re talking about today. (Laughter.) Three years on. But it\u2019s an honor to be here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTwo weeks ago, President Trump terminated the United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPresident Trump withdrew from the deal for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risk created by the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNo more. No more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats. No more acceptance of missiles landing in Riyadh and in the Golan Heights. No more cost-free expansions of Iranian power. No more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA put the world at risk because of its fatal flaws.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd they\u2019re worth recounting at some length today, if only for the purpose of ensuring that subsequent arrangements do not repeat them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, the weak sunset provisions of the JCPOA merely delayed the inevitable nuclear weapons capability of the Iranian regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAfter the countdown clock ran out on the deal\u2019s sunset provisions, Iran would be free for a quick sprint to the bomb, setting off a potentially catastrophic arms race in the region. Indeed, the very brevity of the delay in the Iranian nuclear program itself incentivized Middle Eastern proliferation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMoreover, as we have seen from Israel\u2019s recent remarkable intelligence operation, Iran has lied for years about having had a nuclear weapons program. Iran entered into the JCPOA in bad faith. It is worth noting that even today, the regime continues to lie.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told a Sunday morning news show, \u201cWe never wanted to produce a bomb.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis claim \u2013 this claim would be laughable if not for the willful deception behind it. Not only did the AMAD Program exist; the Iranians took great care \u2013 though, as we can see now, not enough care \u2013 to protect, hide, and preserve the work of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Mahabadi and his gang of nuclear scientists.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA had additional shortcomings as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal were simply not strong enough.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe deal did nothing to address Iran\u2019s continuing development of ballistic and cruise missiles, which could deliver nuclear warheads.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe JCPOA permitted the Iranian regime to use the money from the JCPOA to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people, but the regime\u2019s leaders refused to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tInstead, the government spent its newfound treasure fueling proxy wars across the Middle East and lining the pockets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizballah, Hamas, and the Houthis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRemember: Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during the JCPOA. Qasem Soleimani has been playing with house money that has become blood money. Wealth created by the West has fueled his campaigns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tStrategically, the Obama administration made a bet that the deal would spur Iran to stop its rogue state actions and conform to international norms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat bet was a loser with massive repercussions for all of the people living in the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe idea of the JCPOA as a strategic pillar of stability in the Middle East was captured perfectly by John Kerry when he said, quote, \u201cI know the Middle East that is on fire \u2026 is going to be more manageable with this deal,\u201d end of quote.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tQuery whether the Middle East is more manageable today than it was when they embarked on the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLebanon is an even more comfortable home for Hizballah today than it was when we embarked on the JCPOA. Hizballah is now armed to the teeth by Iran and has its sights set on Israel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to Iran, Hizballah provides the ground forces for the military expedition in Syria. The IRGC, too, has continued to pump thousands of fighters into Syria to prop up the murderous Assad regime and help make that country 71,000 square miles of kill zone.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran perpetuates a conflict that has displaced more than 6 million Syrians inside the \u2013 6 million Syrians and caused over 5 million to seek refuge outside of its borders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThese refugees include foreign fighters who have crossed into Europe and threatened terrorist attacks in those countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Iraq, Iran sponsored Shia militia groups and terrorists to infiltrate and undermine the Iraqi Security Forces and jeopardize Iraq\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 all of this during the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn Yemen, Iran\u2019s support for the Houthi militia fuels a conflict that continues to starve the Yemeni people and hold them under the threat of terror.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe IRGC has also given Houthi missiles to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and to threaten international shipping in the Red Sea.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd in Afghanistan, Iran\u2019s support to the Taliban in the form of weapons and funding leads to further violence and hinders peace and stability for the Afghan people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the Iranian Qods Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe should remember, too, that during the JCPOA Iran continues to hold Americans hostage: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and Bob Levinson, who has been missing for over 11 years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI will note for the American people, you should know we are working diligently to bring each American missing wrongfully detained in Iran home.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe list continues. Iran continues to be, during the JCPOA, the world\u2019s largest sponsor of terror. It continues to serve as sanctuary for al-Qaida, as it has done since 9/11, and remains unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members residing in Tehran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hizballah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaida? The United States believe you deserve better.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I have an additional point for the Iranian people to ponder. Here in the West, President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif are often held apart from the regime\u2019s unwise terrorist and malign behavior. They are treated somehow differently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe West says, \u201cBoy, if only they could control Ayatollah Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani then things would be great.\u201d Yet, Rouhani and Zarif are your elected leaders. Are they not the most responsible for your economic struggles? Are these two not responsible for wasting Iranian lives throughout the Middle East?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt\u2019s worth the Iranian people considering, because instead of helping their own citizens, the regime continues to seek a corridor stretching from Iran\u2019s borders to the shores of the Mediterranean. Iran wants this corridor to transport fighters and an advanced weapons system to Israel\u2019s doorsteps. Indeed in recent months, the IRGC has flown an armed drone into Israeli airspace and launched salvos of rockets into the Golan Heights from Syria. Our steadfast ally has asserted the sovereign right of self-defense in response, a stance the United States will continue to unequivocally support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo the bet \u2013 the bet that the JCPOA would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East, and indeed for the entire world. It is clear that the JCPOA has not ended Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, nor did it deter its quest for a regional hegemony. Iran\u2019s leaders saw the deal as the starting gun for the march across the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo, the path forward. America\u2019s commitment to the Iran strategy President Trump laid down in October remains. It will now be executed outside of the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ll continue to work with allies to counter the regime\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran\u2019s proliferation of missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten peace and stability. We will also ensure Iran has no path to a nuclear weapon \u2013 not now, not ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFollowing our withdrawal from the JCPOA, President Trump has asked me to achieve these goals on Iran. We\u2019ll pursue those goals along several lines of effort.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, we will apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime. The leaders in Tehran will have no doubt about our seriousness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThanks to our colleagues at the Department of Treasury, sanctions are going back in full effect and new ones are coming. Last week we imposed sanctions on the head of Iran\u2019s central bank and other entities that were funneling money to the IRGC Qods Force. They were also providing money to Hizballah and other terrorist organizations. The Iranian regime should know that this is just the beginning.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThis sting of sanctions will be painful if the regime does not change its course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen to one that rejoins the league of nations. These will indeed end up being the strongest sanctions in history when we are complete.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come in force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran will be forced to make a choice: either fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It will not have the resources to do both.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, I will work closely with the Department of Defense and our regional allies to deter Iranian aggression.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe will ensure freedom of navigation on the waters in the region. We will work to prevent and counteract any Iranian malign cyber activity. We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hizballah proxies operating around the world and we will crush them. Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd I\u2019d remind the leadership in Iran what President Trump said: If they restart their nuclear program, it will mean bigger problems \u2013 bigger problems than they\u2019d ever had before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, we will also advocate tirelessly for the Iranian people. The regime must improve how it treats its citizens. It must protect the human rights of every Iranian. It must cease wasting Iran\u2019s wealth abroad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe ask that our international partners continue to add their voice to ours in condemning Iran\u2019s treatment of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe protests \u2013 the protests of the past few months show that the Iranian people are deeply frustrated with their own government\u2019s failures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian economy is struggling as a result of bad Iranian decisions. Workers aren\u2019t getting paid, strikes are a daily occurrence, and the rial is plummeting. Youth unemployment is at a staggering 25 percent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tGovernment mismanagement of Iran\u2019s natural resources has led to severe droughts and other environmental crises as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLook, these problems are compounded by enormous corruption inside of Iran, and the Iranian people can smell it. The protests last winter showed that many are angry at the regime that keeps for itself what the regime steals from its people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd Iranians too are angry at a regime elite that commits hundreds of millions of dollars to military operations and terrorist groups abroad while the Iranian people cry out for a simple life with jobs and opportunity and with liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime\u2019s response to the protests has only exposed the country\u2019s leadership is running scared. Thousands have been jailed arbitrarily, and at least dozens have been killed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs seen from the hijab protests, the brutal men of the regime seem to be particularly terrified by Iranian women who are demanding their rights. As human beings with inherent dignity and inalienable rights, the women of Iran deserve the same freedoms that the men of Iran possess.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut this is all on top of a well-documented terror and torture that the regime has inflicted for decades on those who dissent from the regime\u2019s ideology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Iranian regime is going to ultimately have to look itself in the mirror. The Iranian people, especially its youth, are increasingly eager for economic, political, and social change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States stands with those longing for a country of economic opportunity, government transparency, fairness, and greater liberty.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe hope, indeed we expect, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses and support \u2013 not suppress \u2013 the aspirations of its own citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019re open to new steps with not only our allies and partners, but with Iran as well. But only if Iran is willing to make major changes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs President Trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing, and able to negotiate a new deal. But the deal is not the objective. Our goal is to protect the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAny new agreement will make sure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and will deter the regime\u2019s malign behavior in a way that the JCPOA never could. We will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations, and we will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself. The Iranian wave of destruction in the region in just the last few years is proof that Iran\u2019s nuclear aspirations cannot be separated from the overall security picture.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo what should it be? We must begin to define what it is that we demand from Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, Iran must declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThird, Iran must also provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, each of them detained on spurious charges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must also end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring senior al-Qaida leaders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran, too, must end the IRG Qods Force\u2019s support for terrorists and militant partners around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd too, Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors \u2013 many of whom are U.S. allies. This certainly includes its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also includes threats to international shipping and destructive \u2013 and destructive cyberattacks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThat list is pretty long, but if you take a look at it, these are 12 very basic requirements. The length of the list is simply a scope of the malign behavior of Iran. We didn\u2019t create the list, they did.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom my conversations with European friends, I know that they broadly share these same views of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community. I ask that America\u2019s allies join us in calling for the Iranian Government to act more responsibly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn exchange for major changes in Iran, the United States is prepared to take actions which will benefit the Iranian people. These areas of action include a number of things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFirst, once this is achieved, we\u2019re prepared to end the principal components of every one of our sanctions against the regime. We\u2019re happy at that point to re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relationships with Iran. And we\u2019re prepared to admit<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a _fcksavedurl=\"#_edn1\" href=\"#_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Iran to have advanced technology. If Iran makes this fundamental strategic shift, we, too, are prepared to support the modernization and reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international economic system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut relief from our efforts will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran\u2019s policies. We acknowledge Iran\u2019s right to defend its people. But not its actions which jeopardize world\u2019s citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlso, in contrast to the previous administration, we want to include Congress as a partner in this process. We want our efforts to have broad support with the American people and endure beyond the Trump Administration. A treaty would be our preferred way to go.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tUnlike the JCPOA, which was broadly rejected across both sides of the aisle, an agreement that President Trump proposes would surely garner this type of widespread support from our elected leaders and the American people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn the strategy we laid out today, we want the support of our most important allies and partners in the region and around the globe. Certainly our European friends, but much more than that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI want the Australians, the Bahrainis, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Japanese, the Jordanians, the Kuwaitis, the Omanis, the Qataris, the Saudi Arabians, South Korea, the UAE, and many, many others worldwide to join in this effort against the Islamic Republic of Iran. I know that those countries share the same goals. They understand the challenge the same way that America does. Indeed, we welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation, and the brutality of a regime which is at odds with world peace, a country that continues to inflict chaos on innocent people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIndeed, while to some the changes in Iranian behavior we seek may seem unrealistic, we should recall that what we are pursuing was the global consensus before the JCPOA.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFor example, in 2012, President Obama said, quote, \u201cThe deal we\u2019ll accept is [that] they end their nuclear program,\u201d end of quote. That didn\u2019t happen. In 2006, the P5 voted at the Security Council for Iran to immediately suspend all enrichment activities. That didn\u2019t happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2013, the French foreign minister said he was wary of being sucked into a, quote, \u201ccon game,\u201d end of quote, over allowing Iran to continue uranium enrichment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn 2015, John Kerry said, quote, \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize the right to enrich,\u201d end of quote. Yet the Iranians are enriching even as we sit here today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo we\u2019re not asking anything other than that Iranian behavior be consistent with global norms, global norms widely recognized before the JCPOA. And we want to eliminate their capacity to threaten our world with those nuclear activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWith respect to its nuclear activities, why would we allow Iran more capability than we have permitted the United Arab Emirates and that we\u2019re asking for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? We understand that our reimposition of sanctions and the coming pressure campaign on the Iranian regime will pose financial and economic difficulties for a number of our friends. Indeed, it imposes economic challenges to America as well. These are markets our businesses would love to sell into as well. And we want to hear their concerns.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBut we will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account. Over the coming weeks, we will send teams of specialists to countries around the world to further explain administration policy, to discuss the implications of sanctions we imposition, and to listen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI know. I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time with our allies in my first three weeks. I know that they may decide to try and keep their old nuclear deal going with Tehran. That is certainly their decision to make. They know where we stand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNext year marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic \u2013 Revolution in Iran. At this milestone, we have to ask: What has the Iranian Revolution given to the Iranian people? The regime reaps a harvest of suffering and death in the Middle East at the expense of its own citizens. Iran\u2019s economy is stagnant and without direction and about to get worse. Its young people are withering under the weight of frustrated ambitions. They are longing to pursue the freedoms and opportunities of the 21st century.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIran\u2019s leaders can change all of this if they choose to do so. Ali Khamenei has been supreme leader since 1989. He will not live forever, nor will the Iranian people abide the rigid rules of tyrants forever. For two generations, the Iranian regime has exacted a heavy toll on its own people and the world. The hard grip of repression is all that millions of Iranians have ever known.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNow is the time for the supreme leader and the Iranian regime to summon the courage to do something historically beneficial for its own people, for this ancient and proud nation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAs for the United States, our eyes are clear as to the nature of this regime, but our ears are open to what may be possible. Unlike the previous administration, we are looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people, not just the regime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf anyone, especially the leaders of Iran, doubts the President\u2019s sincerity or his vision, let them look at our diplomacy with North Korea. Our willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un underscores the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to diplomacy to help solve the greatest challenges, even with our staunchest adversaries. But that willingness, that willingness has been accompanied by a painful pressure campaign that reflects our commitment to resolve this challenge forever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo the ayatollah, to President Rouhani, and to other Iranian leaders: understand that your current activities will be met with steely resolve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMy final message today is, in fact, to the Iranian people. I want to repeat President Trump\u2019s words from October. President Trump said that, \u201cWe stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime\u2019s longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. The Iranian people long to reclaim their country\u2019s proud history, its culture, its civilization, and its cooperation with its neighbors.\u201d\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is America\u2019s hope that our labors toward peace and security will bear fruit for the long-suffering people of Iran. We long to see them prosper and flourish as in past decades and, indeed, as never before.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tToday, the United States of America is proud to take a new course towards that objective.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThank you. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES: </strong>Thank you so very much. Bold, concise, unambiguous. We appreciate you taking this forum here at the Heritage Foundation to deliver that message. Looking at \u2013 and you listed during your speech several of our allies and friends and partners, many of whom are angry, some disappointed. How are you going to bring them on board? How are you going to use your best diplomatic skills to bring them along with us?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> These strategic changes in the world come together when countries decide on an objective that is shared, and that always begins with a shared interest and values. I spent the first couple of weeks of my time as Secretary of State working to try to see if there wasn\u2019t a way to fix the deal. I spoke with my European counterparts. I traveled there. In my 13th hour as Secretary of State I was on the ground in Brussels speaking with my European counterparts. We couldn\u2019t get it done. We couldn\u2019t reach agreement there.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe United States intends to work hard at the diplomatic piece of working alongside all of our partners. We focus on the Europeans, but there are scores of countries around the world who share our concerns and are equally threatened by the Iranian regime. It\u2019s that shared interest, it\u2019s the value set which will ultimately drive, I believe, a global response to this \u2013 to the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror. I\u2019m convinced it can take place. My team is going to work diligently to do that. We\u2019re going to do so in the context of trying to address the concerns of all of our partners, and I am convinced that over a period of time there will be a broad recognition that the strategy that President Trump has laid out is the right one that will put Iran in a place where it will one day rejoin civilization in the way that we all hope that it will.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> It\u2019s clear through your comments this morning that you truly want tough sanctions. And I think that there is some remaining concern about how are you going to deal with the nuclear concerns. Can you speak to that for just a bit? And let me say to our audience, by the way, that I wish we had more time with the Secretary this morning, and there will be an abrupt and a hard stop because we have to get him out to the CIA and \u2013 for the swearing-in ceremony, and we don\u2019t want you late for that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo talk to us about --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> I got to go back one more time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> One more time. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Look, the nuclear file is imperative. It presents the largest, most severe threat for sure. The JCPOA fell short. It was a delay. Our aim is to get that permanently fixed. I mentioned quickly, right, we ask our other Middle Eastern partners to do hard things. We put a 123 agreement in front of them and say, \u201cThis is what you have to do.\u201d And they say, \u201cHey, the Iranians enrich.\u201d That\u2019s reasonable. That seems to me a reasonable point.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWell, our demands on Iran aren\u2019t unreasonable. Give up your program. End it. Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we\u2019re fully prepared to respond to that as well. I\u2019m certainly not going to share with you today precisely what our response will be. But we watch them talk. We\u2019ve heard them say \u2013 I hope that they\u2019ll make a different decision, that they\u2019ll choose a different path. We welcome them taking a path that other nations in the region are beginning to take as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, can you explain for us the sanctions structure and how you intend to target the Iranian regime without hurting our European friends?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Well, any time sanctions are put in place, countries have to give up economic activity. So the Americans have given up economic activity now for an awfully long time, and I\u2019ll concede there are American companies who would love to do business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. There\u2019s a huge market there. It\u2019s a big, vibrant, wonderful peoples. But everyone is going to have to participate in this. Every country is going to have to understand that we cannot continue to create wealth for Qasem Soleimani.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRight, that\u2019s what this is. At the end of the day, this money has flowed to him. The economics have permitted them to run roughshod across the Middle East. Our effort is to strangle his economic capacity to do harm to the Middle East and to the world. Nuclear programs aren\u2019t cheap. To the extent we are effective at making it more difficult on the Iranian regime, we will reduce their capacity to continue to build out their nuclear weapon system as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> You\u2019ve laid out a very, very bold plan this morning. Do you have a timeframe for getting all this done?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So the sanctions are back in place and are winding down over the next 100 and what, 55 days? There are \u2013 there\u2019s lots more work in place. It is a effort across all of government. We are working certainly diplomatically in the lead, but Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, each of us has the same mission from President Trump. I can\u2019t put a timeline on it. But at the end of the day, the Iranian people will decide the timeline. At the end of the day, the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly, that would be wonderful. If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forward today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Well, Mr. Secretary, again, on behalf of the Heritage Foundation and the scholars here who have been working on these issues for a very long time, we want to thank you. Again, it was a bold vision \u2013 clear, concise, unambiguous \u2013 and we want to congratulate you and the President, and we wish you Godspeed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI am going to ask you to remain seated while the Secretary exits. I have about eight more questions here, but --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> For another day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you all very much for being here.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS JAMES:</strong> Thank you so much. (Applause.)\n</p>\n\n</div>"

I\u2019m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with<a name=\"_ednref1\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a> the Secretary of State. Thank you. It\u2019s wonderful to see you.\n\n\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe talked about preparations for the President\u2019s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China\u2019s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tChina, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan \u2013 we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President\u2019s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCouncilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I\u2019m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWelcome.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other\u2019s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and \u2013 contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we\u2019ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President\u2019s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> On June \u2013 on June 12th.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China\u2019s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if you\u2019ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>MS NAUERT:</strong> (Off-mike.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> That\u2019s three, as I recall. Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we\u2019re concerned about it. It\u2019s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe\u2019ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They\u2019ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They\u2019ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are \u2013 and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again in their country. And so we\u2019re working together to resolve it. I look forward to \u2013 I hope we can figure it out. It\u2019s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they\u2019re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSecond, you asked about June 12th. We\u2019re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We \u2013 President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I\u2019m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that\u2019s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tCan you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation --\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> The disinvitation for the military exercises.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) I\u2019m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the \u201cone China\u201d principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> No change. It\u2019s the same policy that America\u2019s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>STATE COUNCILOR WANG:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there\u2019s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don\u2019t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the \u201cone China\u201d principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJust now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven\u2019t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe don\u2019t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That\u2019s our firm commitment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the Pentagon\u2019s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It\u2019s also a decision that\u2019s taken lightly. It\u2019s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China\u2019s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It\u2019s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don\u2019t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<strong>SECRETARY POMPEO:</strong> Thank you.\n</p>\n\n<hr align=\"center\" size=\"2\" width=\"25%\">\n<p>\n\t<a name=\"_edn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> as\n</p>\n\n</div>"

        "date": "May 24, 2018",
        "text": "<div id=\"centerblock\"><p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for doing this interview with us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> It\u2019s wonderful to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> As Secretary of State, you chose Iran as your first major foreign policy speech. Why Iran? Is it because of the urgency or the importance of it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I think it\u2019s both. It\u2019s something that the President has viewed as a serious threat to Middle East stability and therefore to American national security and also looks at the place that the Iranian people find themselves, and he thinks it\u2019s a place America can help make a difference. He has long thought that the agreement that the previous administration entered into didn\u2019t serve any of those interests \u2013 the interests of the Iranian people or Middle East stability or, frankly, for America. And so it was a priority for him and thus I wanted in the first weeks since the Secretary of State to have an opportunity to lay out how President Trump thinks we can make things better in each of those three situations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> What is the ultimate goal of the proposed new security framework, and how is it differ \u2013 how does it differ from the initial JCPOA?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so very different. Different in breadth and I think different in its goal. The first agreement was very narrow. It was an effort to say that the Iranian regime was spending a ton of money on its nuclear program and it wanted to halt that \u2013 a noble objective, a good goal, a worthy one. But the threat that Iran presents is so much greater than that, right. They\u2019re taking \u2013 they\u2019re launching missiles into Muslim countries. They\u2019re taking the human rights away from their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAll of these things I think President Trump cares deeply about, and so his vision is that if we begin again to set out what we think are pretty basic ideas, right. So these 12 things that I listed are all pretty straightforward. We\u2019re not asking a lot from the Iranian leadership, just behave like normal leaders; don\u2019t loot your people, don\u2019t waste your people\u2019s money on these adventures in Syria and Yemen and in Lebanon and in Iraq, the list goes on; lead your people, build a great nation, use the resources you have for that. That\u2019s all we\u2019re simply looking for.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Is that going to be part of the new proposed security framework that Iran would stop or should stop meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, so we\u2019ve asked for that. Look, we\u2019ve asked them to stop spreading terror around the world, not to build out militias in Iraq, not to put Iranian dollars and Iranian citizens, who are losing their lives in Syria \u2013 it\u2019s inappropriate for Middle East security and it\u2019s bad for the country. So our aim is to set conditions where Iran will behave like a normal nation, right. And if they do that, if they \u2013 and this is not the Iranian people. This is the Iranian leaders who have taken control and done this damage. If we can create conditions where they\u2019ll stop that, the Iranian people will have great success, and we will have Americans visiting there, and we\u2019ll have all the great things that we do when there are friends and allies as opposed to folks who are presenting risk to our country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I\u2019m going to get to the human rights issue also, sir. But if I may, I want to continue on the security framework if possible. How about a requirement for Iran to let inspections in the military sites? Is that going to be part of also the framework?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> So it is. With respect to the use of nuclear material in Iran, just as we have in Saudi Arabia, just as we did with the United Arab Emirates, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for Iran to have the capacity to create fissile material, to enrich uranium or have a plutonium facility. If they want a peaceful nuclear energy program, fine, but they could import that material. And other countries do it; it works for many countries around the world. And in order for us to achieve that, to get comfortable that that\u2019s the case, there will have to be inspections. That would include inspections at military sites and research laboratories and all the places that had been participants in previous iterations of Iran\u2019s program.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And you mentioned human rights. There are protests, anti-government protests, all around Iran. I wanted to get your take on that. What do you \u2013 how do you feel about these protests? And do you think that United States can maybe support the protestors?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We can certainly provide moral support. I think importantly, the Iranian people will make these decisions for themselves. These protests have been ongoing now for months and months \u2013 some of them very small, some of them larger \u2013 often very much in sync with what I laid out this past week, their \u2013 how this wealth gets distributed to Qasem Soleimani and not the ordinary citizen in southeast Iran or in Tehran or wherever it might be. This wealth is being squandered so that ordinary Iranian citizens are both sending their young men off to fight and die and living lives that aren\u2019t as secure and as wealthy as they could be if Iran would simply change its behavior.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo it\u2019s not about \u2013 you asked about regime change. It\u2019s not about changing the regime. It\u2019s about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people really want them to do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> So it is what earlier John Bolton had said, that the goal of the administration is not regime change in Iran?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> That\u2019s correct. Yes, ma\u2019am.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> And how do you feel about the opposition groups in the United States and in Europe? Do you support their efforts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yes. They should be \u2013 so long as they\u2019re working towards the same goal that we are. I\u2019ve seen from time to time that wasn\u2019t always the case with some of the groups, some of the smaller groups, frankly. So long as they\u2019re working towards the same thing. We don\u2019t want them advocating for regime change either. We want them working on behalf of the Iranian people, ordinary Iranian citizens who want nothing more than to live their lives, to be able to take their hijab off, to be able to go to work and raise their families and worship in the way they want to worship. This is for the Iranian people to do, and so if there are those on the outside who are working towards that goal, we certainly welcome it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, two years ago as a congressman you personally wanted to go to Iran, you were prepared to go to Iran, and you wanted to press the leadership \u2013 Khamenei and Zarif \u2013 to give you access to the American hostages. As Secretary, are you going to press the Iranian leadership again to free the American hostages? And as you know, Bob Levinson has disappeared more than 11 years ago.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> I know the story of Mr. Levinson well. I pray for his safe return, and our team works for it every day. As for the other Americans, we hope that the Iranian leadership \u2013 Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, Ayatollah \u2013 all would see that it\u2019s in their best interests to \u2013 and for nothing more than basic humanity, to allow these innocent Americans to return to their families. There are big, big issues out there, but it seems pretty basic to me that one ought not hold innocent people from returning to their loved ones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo yes, we\u2019ll work on it. We\u2019ll pray for it. And we hope that one day, in the same way that we were blessed to have three Americans return from North Korea a few weeks past, we have that same kind of day for those that are being held by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> I wanted to ask you about the chants, the slogans that we still hear inside Iran: \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d Before any type of agreement that Iran or Tehran and the United States would have about Iran, don\u2019t you think that it should be a requirement for Iran to stop that?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Yeah, their leaders most especially. In America, people say all kinds of things. We have a wide-open democracy. There are people who like President Trump and who don\u2019t. I find that just fine. I am untroubled by that.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen you have senior leaders, when you have others fomenting these sort of fake gatherings to do nothing but come after and talk \u2013 chant, \u201cDeath to America\u201d or \u201cDeath to Israel,\u201d the Iranian leadership ought to stop. They ought to stop that because it\u2019s not the right thing for their people.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tI think most Iranians \u2013 I think most Iranians look at what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish here in America and how blessed we\u2019ve been, and think that that\u2019s a model that works in the sense of we\u2019ll certainly adopt a different form of democracy, and we\u2019ll have a different form of government, and we\u2019ll have different values and beliefs across a certain set of things, we\u2019ll have different religions, and that \u2013 that\u2019s all fine. But the basic common understanding of humanity, that you treat every human being with dignity and respect, that you don\u2019t export violence around the world, that you don\u2019t steal and plunder from your people, those core values that are civilizational, they\u2019re historical \u2013 I think the Iranian people share those in the same way that the American people do.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, I want to go back to something that you said, part of your speech. You stressed that \u2013 stressed, and you just mentioned it, that \u201cno more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats.\u201d What is your take on congressional efforts to expose the hidden wealth of the corrupt leaders of Iran, from Ayatollah Khamenei to the president? And if there is such a bill that would pass Congress, would the administration support this exposure?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> We would. We think it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s just as important as an informational matter. The Iranian people deserve the truth. You have senior leaders that are pocketing money, using businesses that are nominally fronts, and frankly, just stealing. To the extent we can prove that and demonstrate that, I\u2019d welcome the chance to expose it so the Iranian people can judge for themselves whether these are the individuals they want to lead their country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>SECRETARY POMPEO:</b> Thank you very much, ma\u2019am. It was great to be with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>QUESTION:</b> We appreciate it very, very much.\n</p>\n\n</div>"
